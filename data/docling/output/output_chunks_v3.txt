INTRODUCTION
The  term  'tropics'  refers  to  the  region  of  the  earth  lying  between the  Tropic  of  Cancer  and  the  Tropic  of  Capricorn.  In  the  tropics, warm  climate,  poverty,  lack  of  education,  and  poor  sanitation provide an ideal environment for pathogens, vectors and intermediate hosts to flourish [1]. In this vast landmass, respiratory infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children and adults [2]. In a typical tropical clinic, 20-40% of outpatients have respiratory complaints, and 20-30% of inpatients have lung disease (Table 1-1) [2].

============================================================
CHUNK 2
============================================================
INTRODUCTION
Many tropical patients suffer from lung diseases that are found worldwide,  e.g.  asthma,  bronchiectasis,  chronic  obstructive  lung  disease, HIV infection-related lung disease, and lung cancer. Numerous dust diseases, e.g. silicosis, asbestosis, byssinosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis,  and  diseases  due  to  microbial  contamination  of  agricultural products, remain under-recognized. Diseases associated with pulmonary  symptoms  and  infection  that  are  concentrated  in  the  tropics include  malaria,  pulmonary  schistosomiasis,  melioidosis,  paragonimiasis,  echinococcal  cysts,  tropical  eosinophilia,  and  diseases related  to  nutritional deficiencies [3].  In  addition,  individuals  who come in contact with birds or animals may develop zoonoses such as tularemia,  psittacosis,  Q  fever  and  leptospirosis  [4].  In  the  tropics, indoor air pollution caused by biomass fuels used for cooking and heating of the homes and huts is an important cause of obstructive lung disease and chronic lung infections [5].

============================================================
INTRODUCTION
A reasonable approach to the patient with lung disease in the tropic starts  with  age,  occupational  exposure,  physical  examination,  HIV status, chest x-ray and blood tests. In children, bacterial pneumonia is the most common and life-threatening disorder. Known immunodeficiency suggests tuberculosis, fungi and opportunistic pathogens. Peripheral blood eosinophilia with either a pleural effusion or diffuse parenchymal  consolidation  may  suggest  a  parasitic  infection,  or, when  combined  with  wheezing,  tropical  pulmonary  eosinophilia. Worldwide diseases like COPD may affect nonsmoking individuals due to indoor pollutants.

============================================================
CHUNK 6
============================================================
PNEUMONIA
Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common bacterial cause of pneumonia. Upper  respiratory  involvement  often  precedes  the  onset  of pneumococcal  pneumonia,  which  is  characterized  by  fever,  chills, malaise and sweating. The patient is flushed and febrile with a rapid pulse and respiratory rate. Dyspnea is associated with a nonproductive cough, and sputum, if present, may be thick, tenacious or 'rusty' . Severe pleuritic chest pain causing tachypnea and grunting respiration is often present. Such symptoms are abrupt in young, immunocompetent patients (Fig.1.1) [6].

============================================================
CHUNK 7
============================================================
PNEUMONIA
In elderly patients, symptoms may be few and can be dominated by confusion, delirium and prostration [7]. Physical examination of the affected lung, usually the lower lobe, reveals diminished lung expansion, impaired percussion note, decreased breath sounds, crepitations (crackles/rales)  and  bronchial  breath  sounds.  Cyanosis  is  common and a herpes simplex eruption may be seen on the lips. With proper treatment,  most  patients  with  pneumococcal  pneumonia  improve clinically  and  radiographically  within  1-2  weeks.  When  resolution occurs, fever subsides within a week as the temperature decreases following  a  crisis  pattern  (Fig.  1.2A).  Delayed  resolution  is  seen  in smokers, the elderly,  and in  those with poor nutrition,  diabetes  or other comorbid illnesses.

============================================================
CHUNK 8
============================================================
PNEUMONIA
Staphylococcal  pneumonia  ( Staphylococcus aureus ), accounts for 2-10% of acute community-acquired pneumonias. It is an important cause of pneumonia in children, the elderly, patients recovering from influenza, people with diabetes mellitus, and those who are immunocompromised.  Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus  aureus (MRSA) causes illness in 1% of cases of upper or lower respiratory tract infection in the community and in 10% of patients who are hospitalized. Patients  with  staphylococcal  pneumonia  are  usually  ill  with  high fever, shaking chills, chest pain, cough and purulent sputum. Chest x-ray films show patchy consolidation and cavities.

INVESTIGATIONS AND MANAGEMENT
Sputum examination is an important aid in the diagnosis of pneumonia. Color, amount, consistency and odor are helpful: mucopurulent sputum is commonly found in bacterial pneumonia or bronchitis; scanty watery sputum is often noted in atypical pneumonia; 'rusty' sputum is  seen  in  pneumococcal  pneumonia;  and  currant-jelly  or dark-red sputum suggests Klebsiella pneumoniae . Foul-smelling expectoration  is  associated  with  anaerobic  infections  due  to  aspiration,

In  severe  pneumonia  in  hospitalized  children,  the policy in low-income countries is to first give benzylpenicillin injections,  changing  the  therapy  to  oral  amoxicillin  when  the  child responds. In very severe pneumonia, in children in low-income settings, chloramphenicol may be given first with benzylpenicillin and gentamicin in combination as an alternative [10,1 1].

============================================================
ATYPICAL PNEUMONIA
Atypical pneumonia is caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Chlamydia pneumoniae , Legionella spp., viruses, tuberculosis, fungi and parasites. This syndrome is not extensively studied in the tropics because of the expense involved in  culturing  and  isolating  various  organisms  and obtaining serologic and immunologic tests.

============================================================
ATYPICAL PNEUMONIA
Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections occur worldwide, affecting mostly school-aged  children  and  young  adults.  A  typical  patient  with mycoplasma pneumonia is an older child or young adult with an insidious onset of fever, malaise, tightness of the chest, and dry brassy cough. Constitutional symptoms are out of proportion to the respiratory symptoms. Hemoptysis, pleural pain and gastrointestinal symptoms are uncommon. The tropical physician should be aware of the non-respiratory  manifestations  of  mycoplasma  infection,  including anemia, myringitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, hepatitis and neuritis [12] (see Table 1-2).

OTHER CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH PULMONARY INFECTION
Leptospirosis is common in tropical areas where sanitation is poor and  water  supply  primitive.  Epidemics  of  leptospirosis  occur  after high  rainfall  in  monsoon  seasons  when  the  water  supply  is  contaminated  by  sewage  or  animal  urine.  About  half  of  the  patients with  leptospirosis  have  fever,  cough,  hemoptysis  and  pneumonitis [13]. Other features are jaundice, conjunctivitis and impaired renal function.

OTHER CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH PULMONARY INFECTION
Melioidosis, caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei , is endemic in Southeast  Asia  (Vietnam,  Cambodia,  Myanmar),  northern  Australia  and West Africa. Melioidosis is hyperendemic in northern Australia, and in  parts  of  northeastern  Thailand  it  is  an  important  cause  of  fatal community-acquired  pneumonia  [14].  Patients  become  infected while  wading  through  fields,  paddies,  and  flooded  roads.  Clinical presentation  is  protean  and  nonspecific.  The  radiologic  picture  of upper lobe infiltration and cavity formation can be indistinguishable from tuberculosis [15]. Diagnosis requires isolation of the organism. The mortality rate ranges  from  20%  to  50%  but is  higher  in  HIVinfected and immunocompromised hosts.

OTHER CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH PULMONARY INFECTION
Respiratory symptoms of cough and chest pain in typhoid are present in up to 50% of cases at the onset of the disease.

OTHER CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH PULMONARY INFECTION
Tularemia is a generalized infection caused by Francisella tularensis and occurs after skin or mucous membrane contact with infected mammals or through the bite of an arthropod, usually a tick or biting fly. Diagnosis should be considered in the presence of a skin ulcer associated with fever, generalized lymphadenopathy, cough and signs of pneumonia.  Pneumonia,  either  primary  from  inhalation  of  an  infected aerosol or secondary to systemic infection, occurs in about 20% of cases.

A sputum  Gram  stain  can  show  bipolar  stunted  rods.  Pneumonic plague  and  tularemic  pneumonia  should  be  considered  when  a severe,  rapidly  progressive  bronchopneumonia  is  reported  in  an endemic area, and 'typical' bacterial  pneumonias have been ruled out.

OTHER CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH PULMONARY INFECTION
In 2002-2003, an unusual coronavirus was responsible for more than 8000 cases of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that spread via international travel across continents from its origin in Guandong Province, China. The SARS coronavirus was previously unknown in humans; a possible reservoir was identified in civet cats and raccoons. After droplet inhalation of the virus, there was an incubation period of 2-7 days, then fever, cough, malaise and headache occurred. Pulmonary inflammation was characterized by desquamation of pneumocytes, hyaline membrane formation and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The chest x-ray showed diffuse opacities or consolidation, especially in the lower lung fields. Recovery could be slow and some patients developed fibrosis. Mortality was 10-20%, with the elderly and those with cardiovascular problems being especially at risk.

Pneumonitis occurs in 10% of the children and coronary  artery  dilatation  and  aneurysms  in  20-25%  of  untreated cases. In Brazil there has been a seasonal rise of the condition at the beginning and end of the monsoon season [16].

Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gatti are saprophytic fungi distributed worldwide  and  are  particularly  abundant  in  soil  contaminated  by pigeon  droppings  in  the  tropics  as  well  as  in  temperate  countries. Pulmonary infection results from inhalation of the organisms from environmental sources [17].

CHUNK 47
============================================================
EOSINOPHILIC PNEUMONIAS
Systemic helminth infection usually elicits eosinophilia and increased IgE. Although eosinophilia can be a clue to a pulmonary helminth infestation, the definitive diagnosis requires demonstration of ova or larvae in sputum, bronchial alveolar lavage fluid, pleural fluid or lung biopsy [18]. Loeffler's syndrome refers to 'simple' pulmonary eosinophilia with no or minimal systemic and pulmonary symptoms. In many  helminth  infestations  (ascaris,  strongyloidiasis,  hookworm), the  larvae  migrate  through  the  lung  and  can  cause  fever,  cough, dyspnea, wheezing, hemoptysis and lung infiltrate.

============================================================
CHUNK 48
============================================================
EOSINOPHILIC PNEUMONIAS
Schistosomes cause two clinical syndromes. In acute disease, immature  schistosomula  pass  through  the  lung,  and  can  lead  to  fever, eosinophilia  and  pulmonary  infiltrate.  In  chronic  schistosomiasis, especially  when portal hypertension has led to venous shunts, eggs can bypass the liver and plug pulmonary capillaries and arterioles, producing  granuloma  and  pulmonary  hypertension.  Radiographs may show dilated pulmonary arteries (Fig. 1.3).

Tropical pulmonary eosinophilia, typically in India and other South Asian countries, causes immunologic hyperresponsiveness to Wuchereria bancrofti , Brugia malayi or other microfilariae. Clinical presentation consists of nocturnal cough, wheezing, fever and weight loss. Chest radiographs show diffuse interstitial miliary infiltrates (Fig. 1.4); there is  a  high  eosinophil  count.  In  developed  countries,  serum  IgE and  antifilarial  antibodies  can  be  used  to  confirm  the  diagnosis (Table 1-3).

BRONCHIECTASIS, ASTHMA, CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE
Bronchiectasis  is  a  chronic,  debilitating  condition.  Dilatation  and distortion  of  the  airways  leads  to  impaired  mucociliary  clearance, which  encourages  bacterial  colonization  and  bronchial  inflammation.  Patients  have  fever,  chronic  cough,  mucopurulent  sputum, hemoptysis (Table 1-4), wheezing, dyspnea and malaise (Box 1.2).

The diagnosis of bronchiectasis in developed countries is confirmed by  computed  tomography  of  the  chest  (Fig.  1.5);  whereas,  in  the tropics, the diagnosis is mainly clinical and depends upon a compatible history, presence of finger clubbing, sputum that settles into three layers (mucoid or frothy, mucopurulent, and purulent) and a chest x-ray, if available. Treatment includes regular chest percussion, broadspectrum antibiotics for exacerbations, and influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations.

The  incidence  of  asthma  in  the  tropics  is  low  for  unclear  reasons; however, the disease remains underdiagnosed and untreated. 'All that wheezes is not asthma' is a dictum that is true in the tropics, as there are  many  entities  that  cause  wheezing  and  difficulty  in  breathing, including tropical eosinophilia and mitral stenosis. Asthma monitoring in the tropics can be achieved by using an inexpensive peak flow meter. Treatment should fit the frequency and severity of attacks. Betaagonists  and  cromolyn sodium (sodium cromoglycate) are  usually available. Oral corticosteroids in short courses can be used to control severe episodes; however, long-term use of systemic corticosteroids,

BOX 1.3  Key Facts COPD
Chronic obstructive lung disease is a progressive disease which is characterized  by  airway  obstruction  that  is  only  partially  reversible  by bronchodilator therapy. The term COPD encompasses chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Once a common disease of men, COPD is now as frequent in women because of increased tobacco use and the widespread use of dung and biomass for indoor cooking and heating in low-income countries (Box 1.3). The most common symptoms are dyspnea and chronic cough. The onset of dyspnea is insidious; at first

BOX 1.3  Key Facts COPD
it  is  mild  and  occurs  only  on  heavy  exertion.  With  progression  of airway obstruction, patients become more short of breath and eventually cannot breathe at rest. Physical examination in the early stage is normal, but in advanced disease, prolonged expiration and expiratory wheezes are audible. In severe cases, the thoracic cage becomes barrelshaped with increased anterior-posterior diameter; percussion note is hyperresonant. When chest x-ray and pulmonary function testing are not  available,  a  peak-flow  meter  is  an  inexpensive  device  to  assess severity of airway obstruction and monitor the response to treatment.

PLEURAL EFFUSION
Pleural  effusion  is  a  frequent  condition with variable  clinical  signs and  symptoms.  Small  effusions  can  remain  silent  and  are  often detected  only  on  chest  radiography.  Large  effusions  are  associated with dyspnea and diminished chest movements on the affected side. Vocal fremitus is reduced; percussion note is stony dull; and auscultation reveals diminished breath sounds and decreased vocal resonance. Sometimes, bronchial breathing is heard at the upper level of dullness. In addition there may be a pleural friction sound.

============================================================
CHUNK 68
============================================================
PLEURAL EFFUSION
If possible, all but the smallest effusions should be tapped. It should be established whether the fluid is serous, bloody, pus or chylous. The effusion  can  be  further  divided  into  transudative  and  exudative, according  to  pleural  fluid  characterization  (Table  1-5).  Laboratory tests that can guide the management of a pleural effusion are macroscopic appearance (Table 1-6), pleural fluid cell counts, biochemistry, pH and Gram stain. A simple test is centrifugation of the fluid. If an originally 'milky' fluid clears with that process, it is presumably an empyema. If not, it is either a chylothorax (pleural fluid triglycerides > 110 mg/dL, e.g. lymphoma, post thoracic surgery) or a cholesterol effusion (pleural fluid cholesterol > 200 mg/dL).

============================================================
CHUNK 69
============================================================
PLEURAL EFFUSION
Transudative pleural effusions occur in heart failure, liver disease, endomyocardial fibrosis, hypoproteinemia/malnutrition and hypothyroidism. The pleural fluid white blood cell count is typically < 10,000 cells/mm 3 , the pH > 7.2, protein < 3.0 g/L, the LDH < 200 IU/L

PLEURAL EFFUSION
Exudative effusions typically have cell counts, protein and biochemical markers opposite to those of transudates. Exudates can be further classified  into  neutrophilic,  lymphocytic  and  eosinophilic.  Neutrophilic exudates may be due to bacterial infection, gastrointestinal diseases, pulmonary embolism, collagen-vascular diseases (CVD) and asbestos-related  benign  effusion.  Pleural  effusion  occurs  in  about 50% cases of pneumonia, and can progress to a complicated effusion (pleural fluid pH < 7.2, positive Gram stain) or to an empyema, both necessitating pleural fluid drainage with a chest tube thoracostomy in addition to antibiotic treatment. Empyema can occur in pneumococcal, staphylococcal (most often) and Klebsiella infections. A right-sided pleural effusion may be associated with amebic liver abscess.

CHUNK 74
============================================================
PLEURAL EFFUSION
The disease presenting with the highest pleural fluid lymphocytosis is tuberculous pleuritis; however, early in the course, there can be a neutrophilic  exudate.  A  large  volume  of  pleural  fluid  should  be obtained for examination for acid-fast bacilli. In about one-third of cases, the tuberculin skin test is negative initially and converts to positive after 2-4 weeks. Knowledge of the HIV status of a patient with pleural effusion, if positive, significantly inclines to a tuberculosis.

CHUNK 75
============================================================
PLEURAL EFFUSION
An eosinophilic  exudate is more common in the tropics. Endemic parasitic and fungal infections are major causes of such an effusion. Ascariasis, echinococcosis and paragonimiasis are some of the causative parasitic infections. Paragonimiasis is associated with low pleural fluid  glucose  and  low  pH.  Fungal diseases  responsible for such  an effusion are histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis and coccidioidomycosis.

NONTUBERCULOUS GRANULOMATOUS LUNG DISEASE
In the absence of chest x-ray or biopsy evidence, it is not possible to diagnose pulmonary involvement due to sarcoidosis and other granulomatous  diseases.  Consequently,  in  the  tropics,  these  disorders remain undiagnosed. The possibility of sarcoidosis should be considered in a patient with dyspnea, uveitis, hepatosplenomegaly, peripheral  lymphadenopathy, chronic  skin  lesions,  and a  chest  x-ray film showing bilateral hilar adenopathy [18].

OCCUPATIONAL AND DUST LUNG DISEASES
The  occupational  disorders  result  from  human  social  activity,  and as such are preventable. The dusts that provoke occupational disorders can be classified into: those that induce granulomatous reaction (e.g. beryllium, talc and organic antigens); those that cause fibrosis (e.g. silica, asbestos and coal); and those that cause neither inflammation nor fibrosis, thus remaining inert (e.g. iron, barium and tin) (Table 1-7).

Podoconiosis  is  an  endemic  nonfilarial  elephantiasis  occurring  in individuals  exposed  to  red  clay  soil  derived  from  alkaline  rock.  A chronic and debilitating disease, it exerts a large economic burden. The silica particles are found in the skin, lymph nodes and lymphatics of affected and unaffected individuals. These individuals have reduced lung function as compared with adults living in areas of low silica concentration [19].
