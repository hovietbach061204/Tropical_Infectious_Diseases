## Sexually Transmitted Infections 7

## David Mabey, Philippe Mayaud

## Key features

- The incidence and prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are higher in developing than in developed countries
- STIs facilitate the sexual transmission of HIV and in)uence HIV replication and disease progression, and vice versa
- Syndromic management of STIs is recommended in resource-poor settings. It is less e*ective for the management of vaginal discharge than for other syndromes
- In regions with a high HIV prevalence, an increasing proportion of genital ulcers presenting to health facilities is due to herpes simplex virus
- Suppressive treatment for genital herpes has been shown to reduce the levels of HIV in the plasma and genital tract of dually infected individuals, but has not reduced the incidence of HIV in high-risk groups or transmission between HIV-serodiscordant couples
- Rapid, point-of-care tests for syphilis are now available which do not require electricity or laboratory equipment, and can be performed on blood samples obtained by +nger prick
- Male circumcision has been shown to reduce HIV incidence by more than half in three trials in African men
- E*ective vaccines against oncogenic strains of human papillomavirus (HPV) are now available and are being given to young women in developed countries

## STIs IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

The impact of HIV/AIDS has been catastrophic in many developing countries;  more  than  20%  of  adults  are  infected  in  some  parts  of Africa. UNAIDS estimates that at least 60 million people have been infected  with  HIV,  of  whom  more  than  20  million  have  died;  2.7 million  new  HIV  infections  occurred  in  2008,  more  than  90%  of which were in developing countries; 33 million people are currently living  with  HIV,  two-thirds  of  them  in  sub-Saharan  Africa;  and  2 million people died of HIV-related conditions in 2008 [1].

Few countries outside Western Europe and North America have accurate  reporting  systems  for  STIs  other  than  HIV.  Knowledge  of  STI epidemiology  is  based  on  the  results  of ad  hoc prevalence  surveys undertaken  in  convenient  populations  (e.g.  STI  or  antenatal  clinic attenders), but these are often unrepresentative of the population at large. STIs are more common in economically disadvantaged populations.  Many  rural  villagers  have  migrated  into  cities  in  developing countries,  and  many  more  have  been  displaced  by  war  or  famine;

poverty and lack of education drive many women into commercial sex; and poor people often lack access to effective treatment.

The worldwide incidence of curable STIs (syphilis, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis  and  chlamydial  infection)  has  been  estimated  by  WHO from prevalence data and the estimated duration of infection. This analysis suggests that, in 1999, there were over 340 million new cases of curable STIs; 174 million cases of trichomoniasis, 92 million cases of chlamydial infection, 62 million cases of gonorrhea, 12 million cases of syphilis, and 6 million cases of chancroid [2]. In view of the uncertainty  surrounding  the  prevalence  estimates,  the  duration  of untreated STIs, and the mean duration before effective treatment is received, these figures cannot be considered definitive.

Large population-based surveys have confirmed the high prevalence of  STIs  in  sub-Saharan  Africa,  even  in  asymptomatic  rural  populations; for example, syphilis (5-10% of adults infected), Trichomonas vaginalis (20-30% of women and 10% of men) and bacterial vaginosis  (up  to  50%  of  women)  [3-5].  Syphilis  is  estimated  to  cause 490,000 stillbirths and neonatal deaths per year in Africa; this figure is  almost  twice  the  number  of  children  dying  of  HIV/AIDS  worldwide [6].

Genital  herpes  and  human  papillomavirus  (HPV)  infections  are common among all sexually active populations, but cause a particularly heavy burden of disease in developing countries. Genital herpes, which  is  usually  due  to  herpes  simplex  virus  type  2  (HSV-2),  is  a lifelong  infection,  causing  recurrent  episodes  of  genital  ulceration which are more frequent, more severe and longer-lasting in immunocompromised individuals. A very high prevalence of HSV-2 infection (30-50%)  has  been  found  in  the  general  populations  of  several African countries [7]. The proportion of genital ulcers caused by HSV-2 has increased greatly in populations with a high HIV prevalence.

Cervical carcinoma is the most common malignancy in women in much of the developing world, reflecting the high incidence of sexually transmitted HPV infection.

The  rate  at  which  an  STI  spreads  in  a  population  depends  on  the average number of new cases generated by an infected individual the  basic  reproductive  number  ( R0 ).  This  in  turn  depends  on  the mean rate of sexual partner change (c), the average duration of the infection (D), and its infectiousness (the likelihood of it being transmitted per sexual act, β ). This relationship has been described by the simple formula: R0 = β *c*D.

The duration of a curable infection depends on the time that elapses before effective treatment is given. A disease such as chancroid, which almost always causes painful symptoms, is likely to be treated rapidly in  populations  with  access  to  effective  treatment,  and  has  almost disappeared from industrialized countries. It remains endemic in core groups  in  some  developing  countries,  although  its  incidence  has declined in the past decade, probably as a result of behavior change resulting from the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In contrast, chlamydial infection, which is often asymptomatic in both men and women, is likely to  be  of  longer  duration  and  therefore  to  persist  even  in  affluent populations with good access to treatment. When R0 declines below 1  in  a  given  population,  the  infection  will  eventually  disappear.

However, even when R0 is less than 1, infections may be maintained in  core  groups  with  a  high  rate  of  sexual  partner  change  (e.g.  sexworkers and their clients), and may continue to occur in the general population as a result of sexual contact with  members of high-risk groups.

## INTERACTIONS BETWEEN HIV AND OTHER STIs

Ulcerative STIs such as chancroid, syphilis and herpes facilitate sexual transmission of HIV by increasing both infectivity and susceptibility. STIs causing genital discharge (e.g. gonorrhea) increase shedding of HIV in both seminal and cervicovaginal secretions [8].

A community-randomized trial conducted in Tanzania showed that improved services for the management of STIs, using the syndromic approach in rural health facilities, reduced the incidence of HIV infection by 40% over a 2-year period [3]. Trials of STI case management using either the syndromic approach or periodic mass treatment in Uganda failed to show any impact on HIV incidence [4,5]. Review of the data from these trials suggested that improved STI case management is more likely to reduce HIV incidence in the early stages of an HIV epidemic, when most HIV infections are concentrated in groups with high numbers of concurrent sexual partnerships who also have a high prevalence of other curable STIs [9].

HIV  and  HSV-2  each  appears  to  facilitate  the  transmission  of  the other  virus.  Suppressive  treatment  for  HSV-2  has  been  shown  to reduce HIV shedding and plasma viral load in co-infected individuals but, disappointingly, two recent trials found no evidence that suppressive  herpes  treatment  reduced  the  risk  of  HIV  acquisition  among high-risk groups, and one large trial found no impact of HSV suppressive therapy on HIV transmission among serodiscordant couples [10-13].

STIs  represent  important  cofactors  of  HIV  transmission,  and  STI control  could  significantly  reduce  the  incidence  of  HIV  infection worldwide, although the impact of interventions may vary according to the local epidemiologic context.

## CLINICAL MANAGEMENT OF STIs

Prompt and effective treatment prevents sequelae and further transmission and should be the cornerstone of an STI control program. Yet  STI  treatment  services  are  often  accorded  very  low  priority  by health planners and ministries of health. If treatment for STIs is to be widely accessible in developing countries, it must be provided at the point of first  contact  with health  services.  It  should be available  at health  centers and dispensaries in  rural  as  well  as  urban  areas.  STI specialists  and  referral  centers  are  best  utilized  to  treat  intractable cases, to train rural health workers, and to serve as a laboratory reference center to monitor antibiotic resistance.

Criteria for the selection of drugs used for STI treatment have been listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) (see Box 7.1). An important point is that drugs in all healthcare facilities that provide STI care should have an efficacy of at least 95%.

Since antimicrobial resistance of several sexually transmitted pathogens, in particular Neisseria gonorrhoeae , has been increasing in many parts of the world, special attention should be paid to the selection of drugs with high efficacy even if costly, since cheaper but inadequate drugs would result in increased treatment failures, referral, development of sequelae and further transmission.

## History Taking and Examination

If  clinical  STI  services  are  to  be  acceptable  to  populations  at  risk, certain criteria must be met: (1) privacy; an adequate sexual history and clinical examination can be taken only in private; (2) empathy; patients  rarely  attend  clinics  where  staff  treat  them  in  a  hostile  or judgmental manner. Time is often short in health facilities in developing  countries,  but there are  certain  minimum requirements  for the

## BOX 7.1  Criteria for the Selection of STI Drugs

Drugs  selected  for  treating  STI  should  meet  the  following criteria:

- high eEcacy (at least 95%)
- low cost
- acceptable toxicity and tolerance
- organism  resistance  unlikely  to  develop  or  likely  to  be delayed
- single dose
- oral administration
- not contraindicated for pregnant or lactating women

Appropriate drugs should be included in the national essential drugs  list,  and,  in  choosing  drugs,  consideration  should  be given to the capabilities and experience of health personnel.

management of STI patients. The history should include details of the present  complaint,  including  treatment  already  received,  details  of sexual  partners  since  the  onset  of  symptoms  and  in  the  preceding month; and past history of STIs.

Examination should include inspection of the mucous membranes, palms and anogenital region; palpation of the inguinal glands, penis and scrotum in men, with  retraction of the foreskin, if  present.  In women, a speculum examination to visualize the cervix and a bimanual  examination  are  required  to  assess  possible  lower  abdominal tenderness (sign of pelvic inflammatory disease, PID, or for differential diagnosis with surgical conditions). The examination should be performed in private in a good light, and gloves should be worn.

## Counseling

This is an essential component of clinical management. STI patients should  be  advised  that  they  are  placing  themselves  at  risk  of  HIV infection and encouraged to reduce their number of sexual partners. They should be encouraged to avoid sex while symptomatic or to use condoms.  Condoms  should  also  be  recommended  for  high-risk future contacts; use should be demonstrated and free samples provided.  The  importance  of  complying  fully  with  treatment  and  of referring sexual contacts for treatment should be emphasized. Patients should be advised to return to the clinic promptly for treatment if they should develop symptoms of STI in the future.

## KEY SYNDROMES

## The Syndromic Approach

Most  health  centers  and  dispensaries  in  developing  countries  lack adequate laboratory facilities for the diagnosis of STIs. WHO recommends  that  STIs  be  treated  syndromically,  according  to  suggested treatment algorithms for the common STI syndromes: urethral discharge, genital ulcer, inguinal bubo, painful scrotal swelling, abnormal  vaginal  discharge,  lower  abdominal  pain  [14].  A  more  recent addition, which still requires validation, is the anorectal syndrome in men who have sex with men. The principle underlying syndromic management is that treatment for all likely causes of a syndrome at the first visit will prevent further transmission, and prevent sequelae in the patients.

WHO has developed simplified  tools  (flowchart  or  algorithms)  to guide health workers in the implementation of syndromic management  of  STIs  (Figs  7.1  to  7.9).  It  is  strongly  recommended  that

countries establish and use national standardized treatment protocols for STIs. These can help to ensure that all patients receive adequate treatment at all levels of healthcare services. The protocols can also facilitate the training and supervision of healthcare providers and can help to reduce the risk of development of resistance to antimicrobials. Finally,  having  a  standardized  list  of  antimicrobial  agents  can  also facilitate drug procurement (see Table  7-1 for WHO-recommended drug regimens for the main STI pathogens and syndromes).

## URETHRAL DISCHARGE (see Figs 7.1 &amp; 7.2)

Most  male  patients  presenting  with  urethral  discharge  or  dysuria (when young) will have urethritis, defined as the presence of ≥ 5 polymorphonuclear leukocytes per high-power field on a Gram stain of a urethral swab, caused by one of four pathogens (see Table 7-1). In the syndromic  management,  treatment  of  a  patient  with  urethral  discharge  (see  Fig.  7.1)  should  adequately  cover  these  most  frequent organisms causing gonorrhea ( N. gonorrhoeae )  and non-gonococcal urethritis  ( Chlamydia  trachomatis )  which  cannot  always  be  distinguished by clinical presentation (presence of profuse purulent versus mucoid discharge) or incubation period (shorter usually for gonorrhea, 3 to 7 days, versus 5 to 21 days). Although variable by setting, dual  infections  are  not  uncommon,  accounting  for  up  to  10%  of cases. If a microscope is available, the diagnosis of gonorrhea can be confirmed by the presence of intracellular diplococci on a Gram stain. Persistent or recurrent symptoms of urethritis may result from drug resistance, poor compliance or re-infection. Given the high prevalence of these once-neglected infections in some settings, Trichomonas vaginalis and Mycoplasma genitalium should be suspected in cases of persistent urethral discharge [15] (see Fig. 7.2).

## SCROTAL SWELLING (EPIDIDYMO-ORCHITIS) (see Fig. 7.5)

Epididymitis is an important complication of gonococcal or chlamydial urethritis. It presents as a painful swelling of the scrotum, usually unilateral;  the  onset  is  usually  more  acute  in  gonococcal  than  in chlamydial disease. Torsion of the testis is an important differential diagnosis,  requiring  urgent  surgical  repair.  Other  differential  diagnoses include trauma and tumor or other infectious causes such as mumps,  tuberculosis  or  brucellosis.  In  men  over  50  years  of  age, epididymo-orchitis  is  more  likely  to  be  secondary  to  a  bacterial urinary  tract  infection  than  to  urethritis,  at  least  in  developed countries.

## GENITAL ULCER (see Fig. 7.3)

There are five common causes of genital ulceration (see Table 7-1). In most developing countries, in the 1980s and 1990s, the majority of genital ulcers were due to either syphilis or chancroid, and in some settings (e.g. Papua New Guinea, the Caribbean, South Africa), donovanosis  (caused  by Klebsiella  granulomatis )  or  lymphogranuloma venereum (caused by L1-L3 strains of C. trachomatis ). However, the pattern of genital ulcer disease (GUD) changes from locale to locale and over time. Since the advent of HIV/AIDS, genital herpes caused by  HSV-2  has  become  the  dominant  etiology  of  GUD  worldwide. Clinical differential diagnosis of genital ulcers is inaccurate, particularly in settings where several etiologies are common. Clinical manifestations and patterns of GUD may be further altered in the presence of HIV infection. Patients with ulcers should therefore be treated for syphilis  and  chancroid  and  all  locally  relevant  bacterial  etiologies.

However, treatment of genital herpes with antivirals (e.g. acyclovir), even though it simply helps healing but does not cure the infection, is now recommended by WHO (see Fig. 7.3) in high HIV prevalence settings.

Laboratory-assisted differential diagnosis is rarely helpful for GUD, and mixed infections are common. Herpes simplex infection can be diagnosed by culture, antigen detection or PCR, but these are rarely available in resource-poor settings. Chancroid can  be diagnosed by culture, but Haemophilus ducreyi is difficult to grow. PCR has been used in research settings, but there is no commercially available test. Darkfield  microscopy  for  syphilis  requires  specialist  expertise  and  lacks sensitivity. In areas of high syphilis prevalence, a reactive serologic test may be only a reflection of a previous infection, and a negative test does not  necessarily  exclude primary  syphilis  as  seroreactivity  may take 2-3 weeks to show.

## INGUINAL BUBO (see Fig. 7.4)

Inguinal lymphadenopathy is a common feature of chancroid, lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) and syphilis. Syphilitic adenopathy is usually painless and does not suppurate, in contrast to the buboes of chancroid and LGV. In males, a genital ulcer is usually visible when a bubo results from one of these conditions, although the primary lesion of LGV is often small, painless and transient. In women, the ulcer may be overlooked unless a careful speculum examination is

performed. The differential diagnosis includes inguinal hernia, septic lesion of the lower limb, HIV infection with generalized lymphadenopathy, filariasis, tuberculosis and plague. Laboratory investigation is rarely  helpful,  though  elementary  bodies  of C.  trachomatis may  be detected  by  immunofluorescent  staining  in  lymph  node  aspirates from cases of LGV.

## VAGINAL DISCHARGE (see Figs 7.6-7.8)

The  syndromic approach for  the management of vaginal discharge syndrome  aims  to  include  treatment  of  cervicitis  caused  by N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis alongside treatment of vaginitis caused by T. vaginalis , bacterial vaginosis (BV) and Candida spp. (see Fig. 7.6). The  syndromic  approach  lacks  both  sensitivity  and  specificity,  as most  cervical  infections  are  asymptomatic  and  only  a  minority  of women  presenting  with  vaginal  discharge  syndrome  have  cervical infections. To improve algorithm accuracy and to save costs linked to overtreatment, WHO has suggested the use of individual risk assessment  scores,  which  are  combinations  of  sociodemographic  and behavioral risk factors and clinical signs found to be locally associated with  cervical  infections  and/or  the  results  of  simple  laboratory  or bedside tests. Past evaluations of risk assessment scores have yielded mixed results, with sensitivities and specificities not usually exceeding 70%,  and  with  higher  positive  predictive  values  and  better  costeffectiveness profiles found in settings with higher N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis prevalence [16]. Such findings imply that effectiveness may vary not just between countries, but also between settings within a  country.  The  WHO  STI  guidelines  have  recommended  that  risk assessment  scores  incorporate  background  cervical  infection  prevalence levels in the target population.

Where  speculum  examination  is  possible,  vulvovaginal  candidiasis can often be diagnosed clinically (see Fig. 7.7). If a microscope is also available, the presence of motile trichomonads in a wet preparation confirms T.  vaginalis infection, clue cells suggest bacterial vaginosis, and  budding yeasts confirm  the presence of Candida spp.  (see  Fig. 7.8). C.  trachomatis and N.  gonorrhoeae are  usually  diagnosed  by nucleic  acid  amplification  tests,  which  can  be  performed  on  selfadministered vaginal swabs,  in  resource-rich  settings,  but  these  are expensive. There is an urgent need for simple, cheap diagnostic tests (e.g.  dipsticks)  to  guide  the  management  of  vaginal  discharge  syndrome in resource-poor settings.

## LOWER ABDOMINAL PAIN (PELVIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASE, PID) (see Fig. 7.9)

Infection of the  female upper genital tract is commonly due  to N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis ,  in  combination with  ascending infection from organisms found in the normal vagina flora, e.g. Streptococcus spp., anaerobes. PID often follows trauma to the cervix caused by termination of pregnancy, insertion of an intrauterine contraceptive device, cesarean section or vaginal delivery. Gonococcal PID usually has a more acute onset and more severe symptoms than chlamydial PID, but either may cause irreversible damage to the fallopian tubes,

leading to  infertility  or  ectopic  pregnancy. In  developing  countries, the diagnosis of PID is usually clinical (lower abdominal and cervical motion tenderness) (see Fig. 7.9). Laparoscopy is helpful when it is available. Important differential diagnoses include ectopic pregnancy, appendicitis  and  endometriosis.  Treatment  should  cover N.  gonorrhoeae , C. trachomatis and anaerobic bacteria.

## ANORECTAL SYNDROME

In recent years, outbreaks of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) have been  reported  in  Europe  and  North  America,  usually  among  HIVpositive men who have sex with men (MSM). Most patients presented with  proctitis,  and  symptoms  included  severe  rectal  pain,  mucoid and/or  hemorrhagic  rectal  discharge,  tenesmus,  constipation  and other signs of lower gastrointestinal inflammation, sometimes severe, whilst genital ulcers and inguinal adenopathy were rare. The resurgence of LGV in settings where only a few imported cases had been seen each year, with its unusual clinical presentation, highlighted the need  to  have  more  accurate  diagnostic,  management  and  control tools. Studies conducted among men and women in Asia and Latin America have shown a high prevalence of anorectal infections in MSM

and in female sex-workers, yet no approach for case management was included in the WHO guidelines. It is likely that a substantial number of  anorectal  infections  go  unrecognized  and  untreated,  especially when low levels of clinical suspicion are combined with stigmatization of anal  intercourse. Thus, there have been calls to introduce a new algorithm for management of the  anorectal syndrome, which will  soon  be  published  by  WHO,  but  which  will  require  further validation.

The likely infectious causes of anorectal syndrome in both men and women are N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis , both non-LGV and LGV (L1-L3) strains, but can also include syphilis, HSV and HPV (involving the stratified squamous epithelium) as well as infections of the rectum and colon, e.g. shigella, campylobacter, cytomegalovirus, amebiasis.  Differential  diagnosis  includes  neoplastic  lesions,  perineal abscesses, and chronic conditions such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. Investigations sometimes performed in resource-rich settings include DNA amplification tests for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis , though these have not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for rectal specimens. Serology for syphilis and HIV are recommended.

- Risk factors need adaption to local social, behavioral and epidemiological situation
- ¹ The determination of high prevalance levels needs to be made locally

## CONTROL OF STIs

Given  sufficient  resources,  it  is  possible  to  control  curable  STIs through the provision of accessible, acceptable and affordable clinical services, combined with partner notification and screening programs in high-risk groups. In most developing countries, case management of STIs must be syndromic, because facilities for laboratory diagnosis are unavailable outside a few specialist centers.

## Partner Noti;cation

Even in the case of easily treatable STIs, control is difficult because of the  high  prevalence  of  asymptomatic  infection  in  both  men  and women. Partner identification and treatment is an important approach to  a  frequently  asymptomatic,  high-risk  population.  In  developing countries, resources are not usually available for the notification of partners by the healthcare provider. Patients must be relied on to refer their  contacts(s).  It  is  important  that  the  clinician  spend  time

explaining the importance  of  treating partners,  both  to  avoid re-infection  and  to  prevent  sequelae  in  the  partner  and  any  future children. Many clinics give contact notes to index cases to pass on to their sexual partners. Unfortunately, partner notification rarely results in the treatment of more than a small number of individuals. Alternative strategies, e.g. providing treatment to the index partner to provide to  his  or  her  partner(s),  have  been  piloted  in  trials  in  developing countries, but it is difficult to ascertain their impact. Moreover, there are risks associated with partner notification in the context of syndromic  management,  since  women  with  vaginal  discharge  syndrome frequently do not have an STI but  an endogenous infection (VVC, BV). Requesting them to refer their partner(s) for STI treatment may be a waste of resources and may expose them to domestic violence.

## Screening

In view of the serious consequences of syphilis in pregnancy, serologic screening for active syphilis is recommended for all women attending antenatal clinics [17,18]. Universal screening of pregnant women for syphilis, and treatment with single-dose benzathine penicillin before 28  weeks'  gestation,  could  prevent  more  than  500,000  perinatal deaths per year [6]. This is one of the cheapest and most cost-effective health interventions available. New simple, rapid, cheap point-of-care serologic tests for syphilis, which can be performed on whole blood obtained from a finger prick, are now available [19]. Since they can be stored at room temperature, and require no laboratory equipment, they could greatly increase the coverage of prenatal syphilis screening at the primary healthcare level in developing countries.

## Male circumcision

This has been shown to reduce HIV incidence by about 60% in three randomized controlled trials in African men, and also reduces the risk of acquiring some other STIs such as herpes and HPV [20,21].

## Vaccination

There are no vaccines against bacterial STIs. However, safe and effective vaccination can be provided to prevent the sexual acquisition of hepatitis  B  virus  (HBV),  particularly  in  high-risk  populations  (e.g. homosexual men, injecting drug users, or prisoners). In addition, two effective  vaccines  against  oncogenic  HPV  strains  16  and  18,  which

cause around 70% of cervical cancers worldwide, are now available and are being given to young women in industrialized countries, but they are expensive and are not yet available in most developing countries [22]. WHO has produced useful guidelines for the introduction of HPV vaccines [23].

## Ocular Prophylaxis

The  prevention  of  neonatal  conjunctivitis  (also  called  ophthalmia neonatorum)  due  to N.  gonorrhoeae or C.  trachomatis should  be  a simple matter. More than 100 years ago, Crede prevented the disease by the instillation of 1% silver nitrate drops into the eyes of infants at delivery. More recently, 1% tetracycline ointment, which is cheap, widely available and easy to store, was shown to be equally effective [24].  Due  to  the  spread  of  tetracycline-resistant  gonococcal  strains, erythromycin 0.5% eye ointment may be more effective. Given the high incidence of neonatal conjunctivitis and its devastating consequences  (Fig.  7.10),  this  simple  measure  is  one  of  the  most  costeffective health interventions available. Yet there are very few developing countries in which prophylaxis of neonatal conjunctivitis is  systematically  carried  out.  Moreover,  a  quadrivalent  vaccine  has additional high effectiveness in preventing anogenital warts caused by HPV genotypes 6 and 1 1.

Ultimately, control of STIs depends on tackling social, cultural, gender and economic disparities in health and in accessing healthcare, and in improving living conditions for the poor, particularly women, in both the developed and the developing world.
