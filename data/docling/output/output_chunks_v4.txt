HEART FAILURE
Heart failure is a clinical syndrome of effort intolerance secondary to a cardiac abnormality with altered neurohumoral adaptation, leading to  salt  and  water  retention.  Heart  failure  is  the  dominant  form  of cardiovascular disease in many tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The epidemiology of heart failure in the tropics differs from that  in  industrialized  countries  in  several  respects  [1].  First,  heart failure in the tropics is due largely to nonischemic causes. Second, the common causes of heart failure in the tropics (Table 2-1) present for the most part in children and young adults before middle-age. Finally, infections  remain  a  significant  cause  of  heart  failure.  Pulmonary hypertension due to lung disease and schistosomiasis, together with tuberculous pericarditis, accounts for at least 10% of cases of heart failure. The burden of tuberculous pericarditis and cardiomyopathy has increased in regions where HIV/AIDS has reached epidemic proportions. Chagasic heart  disease  due  to Trypanosoma  cruzi infection continues to exact a heavy toll on people living in Latin America [2].
In  contrast  to  industrialized  nations,  where  degenerative  valvular heart disease predominates, valvular disease in the tropics is almost always the result of infection. Valvular disease in developed nations is an insidious disease of the elderly, who frequently have comorbidities. In developing countries, valvular disease (with a rapid course) is encountered in the young.
The epidemiology of nonrheumatic valvular disease in the tropics is poorly  defined.  Myxomatous  mitral  valve  disease  associated  with mitral  valve  prolapse  is  an  uncommon  indication  for  mitral  valve surgery compared with rheumatic valve disease. Congenital subvalvular  aneurysms  below  the  mitral  and  aortic  valves  are  rare  forms  of valvular heart disease that were first described in Africa. These congenital subvalvular aneurysms can be associated with varying degrees of valve regurgitation, can rupture or compress the coronary arteries, or can predispose to infective endocarditis or thrombus with systemic embolization.

HEART FAILURE
The major clinical aspects of infective endocarditis in the tropics are reminiscent of the experience in industrialized countries before the antibiotic  era.  Infective  endocarditis  is  a  disease  of  the  young  with high morbidity and mortality. Underlying rheumatic heart disease is the major predisposing factor [3].

STROKE
The  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  defines  stroke  as  rapidly developing clinical signs of focal (or global) disturbance of cerebral function,  with  symptoms  lasting  24  hours  or  longer  or  leading  to death, with no apparent cause other than vascular origin. The agestandardized mortality, case fatality and prevalence of disabling stroke in the tropics are similar to or higher than those measured in most industrialized countries. In the tropics, stroke incidence is higher in people less than 65 years of age, and there is a greater proportion of hemorrhagic  (30%  vs  15%)  compared  to  ischemic  stroke  than  in industrialized countries. In the  tropics,  more  than  90%  of patients with hemorrhagic stroke and more than half with ischemic stroke are

Key features
- The pattern of cardiovascular disease is changing in tropical countries. Although infectious diseases still dominate, increasing urbanization is producing a new pattern of disease that includes hypertension, stroke, diabetes mellitus and ischemic heart disease
- While ischemic heart disease is increasing, it remains rare in rural areas of Africa, India and South America
- Rheumatic heart disease, tuberculous pericarditis, Chagas disease and cardiomyopathies are major contributors to cardiovascular disease in many lower-income countries
- Rheumatic heart disease still disables young patients and is the largest contributor to the cases of heart failure in children and young adults
- Peripartum cardiomyopathy is highly prevalent in parts of Africa; endomyocardial ,brosis is con,ned to the periequatorial tropical regions of Africa, America and Asia
- Chagas disease is a major cause of disability secondary to tropical diseases in young adults in Latin American countries
- HIV infection is associated with a shortening in life expectancy, a reduction in body mass index, and a fall in systolic blood pressure. There is also an increased incidence of in+ammatory cardiovascular disorders, resulting in cardiomyopathy, tuberculous pericarditis, pulmonary hypertension, stroke and vasculopathy, in HIV-infected people. Antiretroviral treatments can be associated with insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and lipodystrophy
- Lack of access to resources leads to an excess of early deaths from congenital heart disease and the late presentation of survivors

hypertensive. While hypertension is the single most important factor for  stroke,  non-hypertensive  causes  explain  nearly  half  of  cases  of ischemic stroke. These factors include structural heart disease, cardiac arrhythmia, HIV/AIDS and other infections (Table 2-2) [4].
Infection with HIV is associated with an increased risk of stroke. HIVassociated stroke occurs in younger patients and is due to an ischemic mechanism in the majority of cases. In tropical countries, treatable infections account for the majority  of causes, with extracranial and intracranial vasculopathy contributing to 20% of cases [5].

VASCULAR DISORDERS
The range of arterial and venous syndromes includes diseases of the aorta, atherosclerotic diseases of medium-sized arteries, and unusual vascular disorders of the tropics (Table 2-3).
Atheroma and dissection of the aorta is present in communities with an  accumulation  of  risk  factors,  including  hypertension.  Similarly, atheroma and aortic aneurysm is becoming more common in people living  in  tropical  environments  as  their  cardiovascular  risk  profile worsens. By contrast, aortitis resulting from syphilis is less common due  to  the  early  use  of  penicillin.  Idiopathic  tropical  aortitis  or Takayasu's disease is found in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. The clinical manifestations depend on the stage and anatomy of the disease. The disease may present with angina, cerebral ischemic symptoms, absent pulses, and hypertension - a common presentation in children [6].
Atherosclerotic disease of the medium-sized vessels presents with a number of clinical syndromes including cardiac pain and coronary thrombosis, intermittent claudication and gangrene of the legs, and mesenteric artery  occlusion. These ischemic syndromes are particularly common in people of Asian, Melanesian and Polynesian origin (who also have a high incidence of diabetes mellitus). Angina in the tropical environment may also be due to valvular heart disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dysrhythmias, syphilitic arteritis or anemia.
Hemoglobin disorders (such as sickle cell disease) contribute to the cardiovascular disease burden either by exacerbating existing cardiac disease with anemia, or by causing peripheral vascular occlusion or pulmonary hypertension.
Idiopathic gangrene of the extremities, gangrene associated with tropical  phlebitis,  and  gangrene  associated  with  acquired  hemolytic anemia are unusual vascular disorders encountered  in Africa.  Idiopathic  gangrene  of  the  extremities  presents  mainly  in  infants  and children  with  bilateral  symmetrical  gangrene.  No  cause  is  found, although  infection  with Salmonella  typhi , S.  paratyphi and Neisseria meningitidis has been incriminated. Predisposing factors are dehydration and malnutrition. The onset of the illness is acute, with fever,

AN APPROACH TO THE PATIENT WITH CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE
Despite variable access to resources for investigation and treatment, the practitioner in a developing country may achieve a great deal with a  thorough  history  and  physical  examination.  The  social  and  geographical  context  of  the  consultation  should  never  be  taken  for granted.
The key syndromes of cardiovascular disease are recognized on clinical  examination.  Congestive  heart  failure  is  characterized  by  pedal edema,  raised  jugular  venous  pressure,  and  tender  hepatomegaly, while stroke is recognized by the presence of a neurological deficit that  is  consistent  with  a  vascular  insult.  Vascular  disorders  present with several clinical syndromes (see Table 2-3), depending on the type and location of the diseased vessel. Features of immunosuppression should be sought in patients with suspected HIV infection.
The essential tests in the evaluation of the patient with cardiovascular disease include urine analysis for protein, blood and glucose, electrocardiography  (ECG),  chest  radiography  and  HIV  serology.  A  full blood count and urea, creatinine, sodium and potassium levels are useful in excluding anemia, renal disease and electrolyte abnormalities as the reasons for presentation. In the evaluation of heart failure, echocardiography  is  required  to  define  the  nature  of  the  cardiac abnormality. In stroke, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive  protein,  syphilis  serology  and  a  computed  tomographic (CT)  scan  of  the  brain  are  indicated.  Other  tests,  such  as  carotid Doppler  ultrasound,  echocardiography,  clotting  screen,  blood  cultures, lumbar puncture and thrombophilia screen, may be conducted depending  on  the  indication  and  available  facilities.  In  vascular disease of the aorta and medium-sized vessels, angiography is essential for the delineation of the disease. Specific diagnostic tests, such as blood culture for infective endocarditis, will be required.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is playing an increasing role in the evaluation of patients with cardiovascular disorders but it is not widely available in tropical countries.

Heart Failure
The differential diagnosis of heart failure is listed in Table 2-1. The diagnosis of  cardiomyopathy is  made  by  clinically  excluding  other causes  of  heart  failure  such  as  hypertension  and  valvular  disease. Patients with hypertensive heart disease and severe systolic dysfunction may present initially with blood pressure in the normal range, with hypertension declaring itself after a  period  of treatment; their presenting blood pressure is low because of markedly reduced cardiac output.  It  may  be  difficult  to  distinguish  hypertensive  heart  failure from idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, because the latter is accompanied by blood pressure readings in the hypertensive range in up to 8% of cases. This difficulty is compounded by the fact that the endorgan effects of hypertension, such as renal involvement and aortic dilatation, may not be apparent clinically.
It is essential to exclude reversible forms of nutritional heart muscle disease such as beriberi (thiamine deficiency). The diagnosis of beriberi should be considered when heart failure occurs in an alcoholic or in an impoverished person or child living in an area where polished rice forms  the major  part of  the  diet.  In beriberi,  neurologic symptoms such as paresthesiae and weakness of peripheral neuropathy  and  Wernicke's  encephalopathy  are  occasionally  present.  The definitive diagnosis is made by demonstrating diminished erythrocyte transketolase activity, which increases after the addition of thiamine pyrophosphate. In areas where  this  testing is  not  available, a short course of thiamine supplementation in all patients with heart failure may be beneficial. A  rapid  response  to  therapy,  with  a  decrease  in cardiac size clinically and on x-ray seen within 2 weeks, will occur in the patient who is thiamine-deficient.
The  forms  of  cardiomyopathy  that  are  unique  to  people  living in tropical environments include peripartum cardiomyopathy,

endomyocardial fibrosis and Chagas disease. The diagnosis of peripartum cardiomyopathy is confirmed by echocardiographic demonstration of left ventricular systolic dysfunction which is not explained by other forms of heart disease. The typical period of disease onset is in  the  last  month  of  pregnancy  and  up  to  5  months  following delivery.
Tropical endomyocardial fibrosis (Fig. 2.1) affects children in very low socioeconomic groups in countries within 15 degrees latitude from the equator. Typically, symptoms are suggestive of congestive cardiomyopathy, but signs resemble constrictive pericarditis. Like congestive cardiomyopathy,  patients  present  with  dyspnea,  orthopnea  and peripheral edema. Like constrictive pericarditis, pulsus paradoxus, a raised jugular venous pressure (JVP) with rapid 'x' and 'y' descents, an  early  third  heart  sound,  hepatomegaly  and  ascites  are  present. Unlike constrictive pericarditis, however, there is frequently a murmur of tricuspid and/or mitral regurgitation.
The  diagnosis  of  endomyocardial  fibrosis  is  made  on  the  basis  of clinical, echocardiographic and hemodynamic changes. Echocardiography shows increased ventricular wall thickness and cavity obliteration; and enlarged atria, with or without a small pericardial effusion. Cardiac catheterization is needed to demonstrate the combination of restricted  filling  and  incompetence  of  the  atrioventricular  valves  as well as to show excess fibrous tissue in endocardial biopsy specimens [8].

Heart Failure
Chagas disease from Trypanosoma cruzi is acquired only in South and Central America; however, migrants from Latin America can present with chronic chagasic heart disease. Cardiac disease is characterized by anginal chest pain and symptomatic conduction system disease; severe,  protracted,  congestive  cardiac  failure,  often  predominantly right-sided, is the rule in advanced cases. Bifascicular block is present in more than 80% of cases and death from asystole and arrhythmia is  common. Autonomic dysfunction is also common. Apical aneurysms and left ventricular dilatation increase the risk of thromboembolism and arrhythmias.
The chest x-ray demonstrates cardiomegaly. The ECG is abnormal as a rule in the late course of the disease. The echocardiographic features in advanced cases are those of dilated cardiomyopathy, including left ventricular posterior wall hypokinesia and preserved interventricular septum  motion  as  well  as  an  apical  aneurysm.  Chagas  disease  is diagnosed by demonstration of trypanosomes in the peripheral blood

Heart Failure
In tuberculous pericardial effusion, evidence of chronic cardiac compression mimicking heart failure is the most common presentation in  parts  of  southern  Africa.  Tuberculous  pericarditis  as  a  cause  of heart failure is less common than rheumatic heart disease, but more common  than  hypertensive  heart  disease  and  cardiomyopathy  in parts of southern Africa. Although there is marked overlap between the physical signs of pericardial effusion and constrictive pericarditis, the  presence  of  increased  cardiac  dullness  extending  to  the  right of  the  sternum favors a clinical  diagnosis  of  pericardial  effusion. It is easy  to  detect  a  pericardial  effusion  using  echocardiography (Fig.  2.2).  Unfortunately, it is not easy to determine etiology using ultrasound; nor is it readily possible to diagnose constrictive pericarditis.
Imaging by CT scanning or MRI (to diagnose constriction) can also be used but is seldom available in tropical areas. Signs and symptoms of tuberculous pericarditis are usually nonspecific and vague. A 'definite' diagnosis of tuberculous pericarditis is based on the demonstration of tubercle bacilli in pericardial fluid or on a histologic section of the pericardium; 'probable' tuberculous pericarditis is based on the proof of tuberculosis elsewhere in a patient with otherwise unexplained pericarditis, a lymphocytic pericardial exudate with elevated adenosine deaminase levels, and/or an appropriate response to a trial of antituberculosis chemotherapy [9].
The  diagnosis  of  circulatory  disease  in  patients  living  with  HIV depends  on  the  presenting  symptoms.  In  patients  presenting  with symptoms  of  heart  failure,  three  conditions  should  be  considered: tuberculous pericarditis, HIV-associated cardiomyopathy, and primary pulmonary hypertension. The diagnosis of primary pulmonary hypertension  is  based  on  the  presence  of  clinical,  electrocardiographic, radiologic and hemodynamic changes of pulmonary hypertension in the absence of primary lung disease.

Stroke
The differential diagnosis of stroke in the tropics is similar to in other parts  of  the  world,  as  outlined  in  Table  2-2.  Radiologic  evaluation by CT scan or MRI (which may be available only in tertiary referral hospitals) will establish the pathologic diagnosis (infarction or hemorrhage) and exclude other conditions that may mimic stroke, such as  subarachnoid  hemorrhage  and  brain  tumor.  A  chest  x-ray  may reveal a primary source of malignancy. An echocardiogram is indicated if a cardiac source of embolism is suspected. In primary intracerebral  hemorrhage,  a  clotting  screen  is  indicated,  and  a  thrombophilia

Vascular Disorders
The  clinical  diagnosis  of  aortic  and  medium-sized  vessel  arterial disease should be confirmed using angiography if possible. In atherosclerotic disease of the aorta and medium-sized arteries, the etiology is related to cardiovascular risk factors which require specific testing and control. In aortitis, the etiologic diagnosis is between syphilis and idiopathic aortitis. When there is doubt about the diagnosis, a biopsy of the artery may be necessary. .70

MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOMES
The principles of management of patients with heart failure, stroke and vascular disease are the same in the tropics as elsewhere in the world.  There  is,  however,  a  need  for  empiric  treatment  in  certain instances  before  a  definitive  diagnosis  is  reached.  For  example,  in patients presenting with a large pericardial effusion from a community  where  tuberculosis  is  endemic,  it  is  appropriate  to  commence antituberculosis  treatment  if  pericardiocentesis  is  not  possible  or before microbiology results become available.
In patients with valvular disease and heart failure due to rheumatic heart  disease  (Fig.  2.3),  ongoing  penicillin  prophylaxis  (past  the age of 35 years) is recommended even if surgery is not undertaken [10].

There are few studies comparing the outcome of patients with heart failure and vascular disorders in the tropics versus nontropical regions. By contrast, a systematic analysis of stroke studies has shown several differences in relation to outcome in the tropics compared to the rest of  the  world.  The  available  case  fatality  data  from  hospital-based prospective studies reveal a rate of about 30% at 1 month - a value much higher than the 20% reported for older populations in the rest of the world. The prevalence of disabling stroke in sub-Saharan Africa is at least as high as in high-income areas.

PEDIATRIC CONSIDERATION: CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE
Congenital  heart  disease  refers  to  malformations  of  heart  structure existing at birth (WHO). It is the most common congenital abnormality occurring in isolation or in combination with other genetic abnormalities.  Whereas,  as  a  result  of  access  to  surgery,  survival  into adulthood  is  the  norm  for  more  than  90%  of  patients  born  with congenital heart disease in industrialized nations, opportunities for surgical correction of defects are rare in developing nations. In many developing countries, the commencement and sustainability of surgical programs must be balanced against the need to control infectious disease and diseases related to poverty.

============================================================
CHUNK 19
============================================================
CLINICAL PRESENTATION
The  cause  of  a  congenital  heart  lesion  in  most  cases  is  unknown. Exposure to teratogens and genetic syndromes account for a relatively small proportion of the total number of defects.
An approach to classification is shown in Figure 2.4.
Approximately 40% of all patients born with congenital heart disease will need surgery in the first years of life to survive. The introduction of a surgical program needs to coincide with major improvements in the under-5-year mortality in a country - a level of less than 30/1000 would appear to be the threshold value.  Relatively  few  developing countries  have  established  surgical  programs  which  meet  or  partly meet the needs of the population in this regard.
The attrition of complex patients in early life therefore will mean that the practitioner is likely to encounter adults with moderate left-toright  shunts,  uncomplicated  valvular  heart  disease,  and  obstructive pulmonary vascular disease. In areas with a high prevalence of rheumatic heart disease, congenital heart disease is likely to be confused with valvular heart disease.
A heart lesion should be suspected in any patient with a recognizable genetic  abnormality.  The  practitioner  caring  for  the  patient  with Down syndrome or Marfan syndrome should be aware that cardiac disease is an integral part of the disorder.
As  would  be  expected,  the  adult  population  with  congenital  heart disease is dominated by atrial septal defect, small ventricular septal defects,  and  mild  to  moderate  aortic  and  pulmonary  stenosis.  The majority of patients seen are symptomatic, with dyspnea and palpitations being the commonest presenting complaints.
Table 2-4 compares the physical signs, ECG and chest x-ray findings in patients presenting in adulthood with the more common congenital heart lesions.
The  final  diagnosis  will  be  confirmed  by  echocardiography;  fortunately, the cost of quality echocardiographic machines has declined with time.
In  patients  with  underlying  congenital  heart  disease,  comorbid conditions common in tropical climates can be present. For example, sickle  cell  disease  is  associated  with  significant  risk  of  pulmonary hypertension.
Diuretics  and  digoxin  are  used  to  obtain  symptomatic  relief  in patients with large left-to-right shunts. This practice is not based on evidence from controlled trials but is an extension from the practice in patients with heart failure.

The relief of symptoms, however, will only be achieved with surgical repair.  Access  to  surgery  varies  markedly.  Many  countries  rely  on charity; well-organized humanitarian missions (such as those offered by the Chain of Hope organization) to target countries can achieve improvements in health for individuals and are more effective  than  movement  of  patients  to  high-income  countries.  Some countries, such as Guatemala, have growing programs which aim to serve as training hubs for a region. Other countries, such as Brazil, have well-established programs offering high-quality and innovative surgery.
When surgery can be offered only to limited numbers of individuals, practitioners  should  select  patients  with  straightforward  conditions that need very limited long-term care.
