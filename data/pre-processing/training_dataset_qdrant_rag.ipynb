A distinctive enanthem known as Koplik spots—tiny white or bluish lesions on an erythematous base along the buccal mucosa—appears shortly before the rash.

Dyspnea on exertion is a key symptom of cardiac insufficiency. - ✓ MATCHES: Patient\\'s demographics (65yo female) and significant risk factor (Type 2 Diabetes) strongly predispose her to cardiovascular disease. Diabetics often experience atypical or \\'silent\\' ischemia. - **Rules Out/Less Likely Mimics (based on the given information):** - ✗ GERD/Esophagitis: While can cause chest pressure, less likely to present with exertional dyspnea and jaw pain as primary associated symptoms without other GI symptoms (e.g., heartburn, regurgitation). - ✗ Musculoskeletal Chest Pain: While possible, the combination of exertional dyspnea, jaw pain, and diabetes makes a purely musculoskeletal origin less likely as the primary diagnosis without specific trauma or localized tenderness. - ✗ Anxiety/Panic Attack: Can cause chest tightness, dyspnea, and palpitations, but the \"persistent pressure\" and clear *exertional* component point more towards an organic cause, especially in a diabetic patient. - ✗ Pulmonary Embolism (PE): While dyspnea is present, the chronic \"persistent pressure\" and jaw pain make acute PE less likely as the *initial* primary consideration compared to angina, without other symptoms like sudden onset, pleuritic pain, or hemoptysis. - ✗ Pericarditis: Chest pain is typically sharp, pleuritic, and positional, often relieved by leaning forward. Less commonly associated with exertional dyspnea and jaw pain in this specific constellation. Step 4) VERIFY AGAINST CLINICAL KNOWLEDGE/GUIDELINES (replacing incubation/transmission for non-infectious conditions): - Reference: Atypical Presentation of ACS in Women: Women frequently present with non-classical symptoms such as fatigue, dyspnea, nausea, jaw/neck/back pain, and palpitations, rather than the classic crushing substernal chest pain. → Patient\\'s jaw pain, fatigue, and palpitations strongly align with this. - Reference: Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease: Type 2 Diabetes is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis and can lead to autonomic neuropathy, resulting in \"silent ischemia\" or atypical symptoms of ACS. → Patient\\'s diabetes supports the likelihood of atypical presentation of a cardiac event. - Reference: Exertional Symptoms: Symptoms (chest pain, dyspnea) that are consistently provoked by exertion (walking upstairs) and relieved by rest are characteristic of stable angina. → Patient\\'s dyspnea on exertion is a key indicator. - Reference: Chest Pain Quality: \"Pressure\" is a common descriptor for anginal chest pain. → Patient\\'s \"persistent pressure\" aligns.

SOB due to severe anemia leading to high-output cardiac failure. Low-grade fever possible. * *Mismatch:* While many symptoms align, *persistent perianal itching* is not a classic or prominent symptom of hookworm infection.

Autoinfection often leads to larva currens in the perianal/buttock region. Chronic scratching can lead to hyperpigmentation and inflammatory changes. * Shortness of breath, cardiac involvement: Yes, pulmonary involvement (pneumonitis) is common in disseminated strongyloidiasis.

South Africa is a known endemic area, fitting the patient\\'s location. - **Clinical Progression:** TCP typically manifests with recurrent abdominal pain in childhood/adolescence/early adulthood, progressing over years to pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and later to diabetes. The patient\\'s history of onset in early twenties and subsequent development of PEI and diabetes over a long period (current age 45) perfectly matches this known progression. - **Characteristic Symptoms:** The patient exhibits all hallmark symptoms: chronic abdominal pain, PEI, diabetes (Type 3c), and weight loss, which are directly attributable to the progressive pancreatic damage in TCP. Conclusion: The patient\\'s clinical picture—a 45-year-old male from South Africa with early-onset (in his 20s) recurrent upper abdominal pain, progressing over two decades to pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, diabetes, and weight loss—is a classic and highly characteristic presentation of Tropical Chronic Pancreatitis, perfectly aligning with its epidemiology, natural history, and clinical manifestations.'},\n",

Step 3) PATTERN MATCHING: ✓ MATCHES Delirium: The entire symptom cluster (acute onset, fluctuating course, impaired attention/consciousness, disorientation, disorganized thinking, hallucinations, memory deficit, behavioral changes) is the classic presentation of delirium. It perfectly fits the diagnostic criteria for delirium. ✗ RULES OUT Dementia: Dementia typically has an insidious onset, progressive course, and generally a stable level of consciousness (until very late stages). The acute onset and fluctuating course here are not typical of primary dementia. ✗ RULES OUT Primary Psychotic Disorder (e.g., Schizophrenia): While hallucinations and disorganized thinking are present, the fluctuating level of consciousness, disorientation, and acute global cognitive impairment are not characteristic of a primary psychotic disorder, where consciousness and orientation are usually preserved. ✗ RULES OUT Encephalitis (as the sole diagnosis): While encephalitis can cause altered mental status, confusion, and seizures, the *fluctuating* nature of consciousness and attention, coupled with the rapid onset, points more specifically to delirium as the *syndrome* rather than just brain inflammation, though encephalitis could be an underlying *cause* of the delirium. ✓ CONSIDER Cerebral Malaria (as a potential underlying cause of delirium): Given the travel history, cerebral malaria is a critical differential for the *cause* of this delirium, but the *symptom constellation itself* is delirium.

All patient symptoms align perfectly with this definition. - The symptoms observed (disorientation, muddled thinking, hallucinations, fluctuating consciousness, memory impairment, anxiety/irritability) are core features of delirium. - The history of travel to a malaria-endemic region provides a potential precipitating factor (e.g., malaria, other infection, dehydration, drug effect) which is always present in delirium (delirium is a *syndrome*, not a primary disease).

The \"unexplained\" nature suggests an acquired rather than congenital or typical chronic condition. - Epidemiology: Travel to Central America is a critical epidemiological clue. This region is highly endemic for parasitic infections, particularly *Taenia solium* (pork tapeworm), which causes cysticercosis. - Incubation Period: Highly variable for neurocysticercosis (NCC), often months to years, as symptoms typically arise when cysts degenerate, causing inflammation. \"Recently traveled\" is consistent with this variable timeline, as infection can be asymptomatic for long periods. - Risk Factors: Exposure to contaminated food/water (containing *Taenia solium* eggs) in an endemic area. This is a common risk for travelers. Step 3) PATTERN MATCHING: ✓ MATCHES Cysticercosis (specifically Neurocysticercosis - NCC): - **Symptoms:** New-onset seizures are the most common clinical presentation of NCC in adults. Chronic headaches, visual disturbances (due to hydrocephalus or direct ocular involvement), and focal neurological deficits are also classic manifestations, depending on cyst location within the brain. - **Epidemiology:** Endemic in Central America. The patient\\'s travel history aligns perfectly with acquisition in this region. - **Pathophysiology:** Ingested *Taenia solium* eggs hatch, and larvae disseminate, forming cysts in various tissues, most notably the brain (NCC). Symptoms often manifest when these cysts die, triggering an inflammatory response. ✗ RULES OUT other common neurological conditions (without specific external reference here, but implied by the strong match with cysticercosis and travel): - Stroke: Typically sudden onset, often lacks the \"unexplained seizure\" component as primary presentation. - Brain Tumor: Possible, but travel history points strongly towards an infectious/parasitic etiology. No other systemic malignancy signs. - Meningitis/Encephalitis: Often presents with fever, nuchal rigidity, more acute and diffuse altered mental status. While possible in some chronic forms, the constellation of symptoms here strongly favors NCC.

Transmitted via fecal-oral route by ingesting *Taenia solium* eggs (often from contaminated food/water, not directly from undercooked pork). - **Clinical Presentation:** Seizures (up to 70% of cases), chronic headaches, hydrocephalus, focal neurological deficits (weakness, sensory changes), visual disturbances (ocular cysts or increased intracranial pressure). - **Incubation:** Can be months to years, as symptoms often occur when the cysts degenerate and cause an inflammatory reaction. - Patient Fit: - **Geography/Exposure:** Patient\\'s travel to Central America perfectly aligns with endemic regions for *Taenia solium* infection and subsequent NCC. - **Symptoms:** The patient\\'s new-onset seizures, severe headaches, visual disturbances, and focal neurological deficits are classic and the most common presentations of NCC. - **Timeline:** \"Recently traveled\" is consistent with the variable and often delayed incubation period of NCC.

VERIFY: Confirm incubation timeline and transmission method fit the geography/exposure * **Etiology & Transmission:** Yaws is caused by *Treponema pallidum* subspecies *pertenue*, transmitted by direct skin-to-skin contact in conditions of poor hygiene. * **Epidemiology:** Predominantly affects children (under 15 years) in warm, humid, rural tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Latin America, matching the patient\\'s demographic and geographic description (\"child living in a rural, tropical area\"). * **Incubation:** Primary lesion appears 3-6 weeks post-exposure. Secondary lesions appear weeks to months after the primary lesion, fitting the \"weeks later\" progression. Tertiary lesions can appear months to years later, consistent with the chronic nature and disabling plantar lesions. * **Clinical Stages:** The described progression perfectly aligns with the recognized stages of Yaws: initial papule/papilloma (mother yaw), secondary framboesiform lesions with systemic symptoms, and late-stage plantar hyperkeratosis. Conclusion: The patient\\'s presentation, characterized by the unique progression of skin lesions (primary papilloma, secondary framboesiform lesions, tertiary plantar hyperkeratosis), systemic symptoms (fever, arthralgia), and specific epidemiological context (child in rural tropical area), is pathognomonic for Yaws.'},\n",

Following this prodromal phase, a rash emerged, beginning in the oropharynx (enanthem) before spreading to the face and forearms. Unlike varicella, the lesions on the skin are deep-seated, firm, and \\\\\"shotty\\\\\" (feeling like BB pellets embedded in the skin).  Crucially, all lesions on any specific body part are in the same stage of development (synchronous evolution), currently presenting as tense, umbilicated pustules.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: ORTHOPOXVIRUS]\\\\nContent: Mpox (formerly Monkeypox) is a related Orthopoxvirus that shares similar cutaneous features with smallpox, including firm, deep-seated vesicles. However, a key distinguishing clinical feature is lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes), which is prominent in mpox (occurring in >85% of cases) but notably absent in smallpox. Mpox lesions also tend to be less numerous and the illness is significantly less fatal (case fatality <1-3% for Clade II) compared to Variola major (30%).\\\\n\\\\n[RASH MORPHOLOGY & DISTRIBUTION]\\\\nContent: The distribution of the rash is a primary diagnostic indicator. Smallpox exhibits a \\\\\"centrifugal\\\\\" distribution, where lesion density is highest on the face and distal extremities (palms and soles are frequently involved) and sparse on the trunk. In contrast, Varicella (chickenpox) presents with a \\\\\"centripetal\\\\\" distribution, focusing heavily on the trunk with sparing of the extremities. Furthermore, Varicella lesions are superficial, evolve rapidly, and present in \\\\\"crops,\\\\\" meaning different stages (papules, vesicles, crusts) coexist simultaneously (\\\\\"starry sky\\\\\" appearance).\\\\n\\\\n[EPIDEMIOLOGY & ERADICATION]\\\\nContent: Smallpox was declared eradicated by the WHO in 1980 following a global vaccination campaign. The causative agent, *Variola virus*, has no animal reservoir and naturally infects only humans. Consequently, any confirmed case today would be considered a bioterrorism event or a laboratory containment breach. Routine vaccination with the vaccinia virus (ACAM2000) ceased in the general public in the 1970s, leaving the majority of the population with waning or no immunity.\\\\n\\\\n[VIROLOGY]\\\\nContent: Variola is a large, brick-shaped DNA virus belonging to the Poxviridae family. Transmission occurs primarily through prolonged face-to-face contact via respiratory droplets, or through contact with contaminated fomites (e.g., bedding). Patients are most contagious from the onset of the enanthem (mouth rash) through the resolution of scabs. Unlike influenza or measles, infectivity requires close proximity, and transmission rates within households are high but slower to spread in wider communities.\"\\n}',\n",

Given the endemic exposure and pathognomonic rash, a diagnosis of Lyme disease was made clinically, and Doxycycline was initiated.\\\\n\\\\n[VECTOR BIOLOGY & TRANSMISSION]\\\\nContent: The primary vector for Lyme disease in the northeastern and upper midwestern United States is the blacklegged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), also known as the deer tick. Transmission of the spirochete *Borrelia burgdorferi* typically requires the tick to be attached for at least 36–48 hours. Nymphal ticks, which are the size of a poppy seed, are responsible for the majority of human cases during late spring and summer because they are difficult to detect. Adult ticks are more active in cooler months but are larger and easier to remove before transmission occurs.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: STARI]\\\\nContent: Southern Tick-Associated Rash Illness (STARI) is a key differential for patients presenting with a bullseye rash in the southeastern United States (e.g., Missouri, Tennessee). Unlike Lyme, STARI is transmitted by the Lone Star tick (*Amblyomma americanum*) and is not caused by *B. burgdorferi*. While the rash (*erythema migrans*-like) is visually similar, STARI does not progress to the chronic neurological or arthritic complications seen in untreated Lyme disease. Differentiation often relies on geography and identification of the tick vector.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: CELLULITIS]\\\\nContent: Cellulitis is a common bacterial skin infection (usually *Strep* or *Staph*) that can mimic the redness of Lyme. However, distinct features help differentiate them: Cellulitis is typically intensely painful, warm to the touch, and swollen (indurated), often with a breakdown in the skin barrier (e.g., a cut).  In contrast, the Lyme rash (*erythema migrans*) is usually painless or only mildly itchy, not warm, and expands rapidly over days, often developing ring-like central clearing rather than diffuse, tender redness.\\\\n\\\\n[EPIDEMIOLOGY & RISK]\\\\nContent: Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne illness in the United States. High-risk areas include the Northeast (from Virginia to Maine), the Upper Midwest (Wisconsin, Minnesota), and the Pacific Coast (Northern California). Incidence peaks in June and July. Risk factors include gardening, hiking in brushy/wooded areas, and having pets that may carry ticks into the home.

Laboratory workup revealed severe macrocytic anemia (Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, MCV 115 fL) due to combined folate and Vitamin B12 deficiency. Stool cultures for standard pathogens were negative, but the clinical picture of chronic malabsorption following extended tropical residence strongly supports Tropical Sprue.\\\\n\\\\n[PATHOPHYSIOLOGY]\\\\nContent: The condition is characterized by the blunting of villi and inflammation of the small intestine lining (*enterocytes*), leading to the malabsorption of nutrients. Unlike Celiac disease, which affects the proximal small bowel, Tropical Sprue often involves the entire small intestine, disproportionately affecting the distal ileum where Vitamin B12 is absorbed. The exact etiology is believed to be a persistent bacterial overgrowth (e.g., *Klebsiella*, *E. coli*) causing mucosal damage. Treatment involves a prolonged course of tetracycline and folate supplementation.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: CELIAC DISEASE]\\\\nContent: Celiac Disease (Gluten-sensitive enteropathy) presents with nearly identical histological findings (villous atrophy) and symptoms of malabsorption. However, it is an autoimmune reaction to gluten, not an infectious process.  Differentiation is key: Celiac disease patients test positive for specific autoantibodies (Anti-tissue Transglutaminase IgA, Anti-Endomysial), whereas Tropical Sprue patients are seronegative. Furthermore, Celiac disease typically does not respond to antibiotics, whereas Tropical Sprue does.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: GIARDIASIS]\\\\nContent: *Giardia lamblia* is a protozoan parasite that causes \\\\\"beaver fever,\\\\\" a common cause of traveler\\'s diarrhea. While it also causes greasy, floating stools and bloating, the illness is typically less chronic than Tropical Sprue and does not usually result in profound megaloblastic anemia. Diagnosis is confirmed by identifying cysts or trophozoites in a Stool O&P exam or via fecal antigen testing, rather than small bowel biopsy.\\\\n\\\\n[EPIDEMIOLOGY]\\\\nContent: Tropical Sprue is strictly endemic to specific regions within 30 degrees of the equator, most notably the Caribbean (Haiti, Puerto Rico, Cuba), Southern India, and Southeast Asia. It is notably rare in Africa, despite similar climates. Travelers must usually spend at least a month in these endemic areas to acquire the disease; short-term tourists are more likely to contract simple bacterial or viral gastroenteritis.\"\\n}',\n",

He lived in rural Cameroon near fast-flowing rivers for 5 years.  He noted firm, non-tender lumps under his skin (*onchocercomata*) over his hips and ribs. Recently, he has developed photophobia and blurry vision in his right eye. Slit-lamp examination revealed microfilariae swimming in the anterior chamber. The combination of chronic dermatitis, subcutaneous nodules, and ocular symptoms in a patient with long-term exposure to *Simulium* blackflies is diagnostic for Onchocerciasis.\\\\n\\\\n[VECTOR & TRANSMISSION]\\\\nContent: The disease is caused by the filarial nematode *Onchocerca volvulus* and is transmitted by the bite of the *Simulium* blackfly. Unlike mosquitoes, these flies breed in highly oxygenated, fast-flowing rivers and streams (hence \\\\\"River Blindness\\\\\"). They bite during the day. Infection typically requires repeated exposure over months or years, making it rare in casual tourists but common in long-term expatriates or agricultural workers in endemic zones like sub-Saharan Africa and parts of South America (e.g., Brazil/Venezuela border).\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: LOIASIS]\\\\nContent: Loiasis (African Eye Worm) is another filarial disease found in similar West/Central African rainforests. It is transmitted by the Chrysops fly (deer fly). A key clinical distinction is the presence of \\\\\"Calabar swellings\\\\\" (transient, migratory angioedema) in Loiasis, which are absent in Onchocerciasis. While *Loa loa* can also migrate across the eye (subconjunctival), it rarely causes the permanent sclerosing keratitis and blindness associated with *Onchocerca volvulus*.  Additionally, Loiasis often presents with high-grade eosinophilia but less severe chronic dermatitis.\\\\n\\\\n[DIAGNOSTICS]\\\\nContent: The gold standard for diagnosis is the \\\\\"skin snip\\\\\" biopsy. A small, bloodless shaving of skin (usually from the iliac crest or scapula) is incubated in saline to allow microfilariae to emerge and be visualized under a microscope.  Newer diagnostic tools include PCR of skin scratch samples and the Ov16 antibody rapid test, which is useful for surveillance. In patients with ocular symptoms, a slit-lamp exam is critical to assess worm burden in the eye before initiating treatment.\\\\n\\\\n[MANAGEMENT & MAZZOTTI REACTION]\\\\nContent: Treatment involves Ivermectin, which kills the microfilariae (larvae) but not the adult worms. Since adult worms live for 10-15 years, treatment must be repeated annually or semi-annually to suppress reproduction. A major concern during treatment is the \\\\\"Mazzotti reaction\\\\\"—an acute inflammatory response to dying microfilariae, presenting with fever, hives, swollen lymph nodes, and worsening ocular inflammation.

He describes his stools as pale, voluminous, foul-smelling, and difficult to flush, often leaving a greasy film in the toilet (*steatorrhea*).  He also complains of poor night vision and easy bruising. Physical exam revealed temporal wasting and dry, scaly skin. Lab results showed low levels of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) and a prolonged Prothrombin Time (due to Vitamin K deficiency). This constellation of findings points to a failure of fat absorption rather than a simple motility disorder.\\\\n\\\\n[PATHOPHYSIOLOGY & CLASSIFICATION]\\\\nContent: Malabsorption can be broadly categorized into three defects: luminal digestion, mucosal absorption, or lymphatic transport. Luminal digestion issues, such as Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency (EPI), occur when enzymes (lipase, protease) are lacking, preventing the breakdown of macronutrients. Mucosal defects arise from damage to the small intestine lining (e.g., Celiac disease, Whipple\\'s disease), reducing the surface area for absorption.  Lymphatic obstruction (e.g., lymphangiectasia) specifically impairs the transport of absorbed fats and chylomicrons into the systemic circulation.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME]\\\\nContent: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS-D) is a functional disorder that is a common distractor. Like malabsorption, it presents with chronic diarrhea and abdominal bloating. However, a key distinction is the *absence* of alarm features in IBS: patients typically do not experience significant weight loss, nutritional deficiencies, or nocturnal diarrhea. Stools in IBS may be loose but are rarely steatorrheic (greasy/floating). Furthermore, IBS does not cause the vitamin deficiencies (e.g., night blindness from Vit A, osteomalacia from Vit D) seen in true malabsorption syndromes.\\\\n\\\\n[DIAGNOSTIC WORKUP]\\\\nContent: The gold standard for diagnosing fat malabsorption is the 72-hour fecal fat collection, though this is cumbersome. More commonly, a qualitative fecal fat stain (Sudan III stain) is used as a screen. To differentiate pancreatic causes from mucosal causes, a D-Xylose absorption test can be performed; normal D-Xylose absorption suggests the mucosa is intact (pointing towards pancreatic enzyme deficiency), whereas low absorption suggests mucosal damage (e.g., Celiac sprue). Specific breath tests can also identify carbohydrate malabsorption (e.g., Lactose hydrogen breath test) or Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO).\\\\n\\\\n[CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS]\\\\nContent: Symptoms extend beyond the GI tract due to systemic nutrient deficits. Protein malabsorption leads to muscle wasting and edema (from hypoalbuminemia). Carbohydrate malabsorption causes explosive diarrhea, bloating, and gas due to bacterial fermentation in the colon. Fat malabsorption results in steatorrhea and specific deficits: Vitamin A deficiency causes night blindness and hyperkeratosis; Vitamin D deficiency leads to bone pain and pathological fractures; Vitamin K deficiency results in coagulopathy (bleeding gums, bruising); and Vitamin E deficiency can cause neuropathy and ataxia.\"\\n}',\n",

A tissue crush preparation (Giemsa stain) showed intracytoplasmic inclusions within macrophages, known as *Donovan bodies*, confirming the diagnosis.\\\\n\\\\n[ETIOLOGY & TRANSMISSION]\\\\nContent: The causative agent is *Klebsiella granulomatis* (formerly *Calymmatobacterium granulomatis*), a gram-negative intracellular bacterium.

However, the clinical presentation is distinct: Chancroid ulcers are classically *painful* (unlike the painless ulcers of Donovanosis) and have a \\\\\"dirty\\\\\" gray-yellow base with ragged, undermined edges.  Furthermore, Chancroid is strongly associated with painful, suppurative inguinal lymphadenitis (buboes) in 50% of cases, whereas true lymph node involvement is rare in Granuloma Inguinale (though \\\\\"pseudobuboes\\\\\" from subcutaneous granulation can occur).\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: LYMPHOGRANULOMA VENEREUM]\\\\nContent: Lymphogranuloma Venereum (LGV) is caused by invasive serovars (L1-L3) of *Chlamydia trachomatis*.

The hallmark of LGV is the secondary stage, characterized by massive, painful, tender inguinal and femoral lymphadenopathy (Groove Sign). This contrasts with Donovanosis, where the primary skin lesion is the dominant and persistent feature, and significant lymphadenopathy is absent.\\\\n\\\\n[COMPLICATIONS & TREATMENT]\\\\nContent: Without treatment, the ulcers of Granuloma Inguinale can spread locally to the inguinal folds, perineum, and anus, causing extensive tissue destruction, scarring, and lymphatic obstruction (pseudo-elephantiasis).

Unlike a splinter or wart, these lesions have rapidly enlarged over 2 weeks and are causing difficulty walking.\\\\n\\\\n[VECTOR BIOLOGY & LIFECYCLE]\\\\nContent: The causative agent is the female burrowing flea, *Tunga penetrans* (also known as chigoe flea, jigger, or nigua). Unlike common fleas that bite and leave, the impregnated female *Tunga* burrows head-first into the epidermis to feed on blood. She swells to 2000 times her original size while producing eggs, creating the characteristic white nodule.

He has a history of poorly controlled Type 2 Diabetes. The symptoms began shortly after the monsoon season, during which he spent long hours wading in muddy water. Chest X-ray revealed a right upper lobe consolidation with cavitation, mimicking tuberculosis. However, blood cultures grown on Ashdown\\'s agar yielded *Burkholderia pseudomallei*, confirming Melioidosis. The \\\\\"safety pin\\\\\" appearance of the gram-negative bacteria was noted on microscopy.\\\\n\\\\n[EPIDEMIOLOGY & RISK FACTORS]\\\\nContent: The causative agent, *Burkholderia pseudomallei*, is a saprophytic bacterium found in wet soil and surface water in endemic regions, primarily Southeast Asia (Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia) and Northern Australia. Infection occurs via inhalation, ingestion, or percutaneous inoculation through skin abrasions (hence the high risk for farmers and gardeners).  The single most important risk factor is Diabetes Mellitus, which increases the risk of septicemia and death by tenfold. Other risk factors include chronic kidney disease and excessive alcohol use.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: TUBERCULOSIS]\\\\nContent: Pulmonary Melioidosis is often called the \\\\\"Vietnamese Time Bomb\\\\\" or a \\\\\"TB mimic\\\\\" because it presents with fever, weight loss, and upper lobe cavitary lesions similar to *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. However, Melioidosis progresses much more rapidly (days to weeks) than TB (months). Furthermore, Melioidosis patients are often acutely septic and may have multiple visceral abscesses (e.g., in the spleen or prostate), which are less common in primary pulmonary TB. Acid-Fast Bacillus (AFB) smears in Melioidosis are negative.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: PNEUMONIA]\\\\nContent: Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) caused by *Streptococcus pneumoniae* or *Klebsiella* is a common initial misdiagnosis. However, Melioidosis should be suspected in any patient with a history of travel to endemic areas who fails standard empiric CAP therapy. Unlike typical lobar pneumonia, Melioidosis often presents with multiple small abscesses (\\\\\"honeycombing\\\\\") in the liver or spleen on CT scan, a feature rarely seen with pneumococcal pneumonia.\\\\n\\\\n[TREATMENT & MANAGEMENT]\\\\nContent: Melioidosis is notoriously difficult to treat due to intrinsic resistance to many common antibiotics (including Penicillin G and first/second-generation cephalosporins). The standard regimen involves an *Intensive Phase* with intravenous Ceftazidime or Meropenem for at least 10-14 days, followed by an *Eradication Phase* with oral Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for 3 to 6 months to prevent relapse.

Stool microscopy identified trophozoites of *Entamoeba histolytica* with ingested red blood cells (erythrophagocytosis).\\\\n\\\\n[PATHOGEN & TRANSMISSION]\\\\nContent: The causative agent, *Entamoeba histolytica*, is a protozoan parasite. Infection occurs via the fecal-oral route, typically by ingesting infective cysts in contaminated food or water.  Unlike non-invasive *Entamoeba dispar*, *E. histolytica* releases enzymes that destroy intestinal tissue, creating characteristic \\\\\"flask-shaped ulcers\\\\\" in the colon lining.

While symptoms overlap, Shigellosis typically presents more acutely with higher fever and severe tenesmus (straining).  It is caused by *Shigella* bacteria, not a parasite. A key distinction is that *Shigella* infection rarely causes liver abscesses. Diagnosis is confirmed by stool culture yielding bacterial growth, and treatment typically involves Fluoroquinolones or Azithromycin, whereas Amebiasis requires Nitroimidazoles.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: GIARDIASIS]\\\\nContent: *Giardia duodenalis* is another common waterborne parasite (often called \\\\\"Beaver Fever\\\\\").

This rash, known as *larva currens* (racing larva), typically disappears within hours only to reappear elsewhere. His symptoms exacerbated recently after being prescribed high-dose prednisone for an unrelated asthma flare. Given his remote travel history and the pathognomonic rash, a diagnosis of Strongyloidiasis was suspected. Stool microscopy revealed rhabditiform larvae, confirming the reactivation of a dormant infection.\\\\n\\\\n[PATHOPHYSIOLOGY & AUTOINFECTION]\\\\nContent: The causative agent, *Strongyloides stercoralis*, is unique among soil-transmitted helminths because of its ability to replicate within the human host (autoinfection). Larvae hatch in the intestine and can immediately re-penetrate the bowel wall or perianal skin to re-enter the circulation, migrating to the lungs and back to the gut.  This cycle allows the infection to persist for decades after the initial exposure in a tropical region. While often asymptomatic, administration of corticosteroids or HTLV-1 coinfection can trigger \\\\\"Hyperinfection Syndrome,\\\\\" a massive, life-threatening dissemination of larvae to major organs (lungs, brain, liver).\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: CUTANEOUS LARVA MIGRANS]\\\\nContent: Cutaneous Larva Migrans (CLM) is the most common mimic but has distinct differences. CLM is caused by animal hookworms (*Ancylostoma braziliense*) acquired from walking on sandy beaches. The rash in CLM is a \\\\\"creeping eruption\\\\\" that moves very slowly (1-2 cm per *day*), whereas *larva currens* in Strongyloidiasis moves rapidly (5-10 cm per *hour*).  Additionally, CLM lesions are typically confined to the feet or areas exposed to sand and do not involve the chronic gastrointestinal symptoms seen in Strongyloidiasis.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: URTICARIA]\\\\nContent: Chronic urticaria (hives) can present with migratory, itchy red welts. However, urticarial wheals typically last less than 24 hours, are raised and edematous, and do not form the distinct linear or serpiginous (snake-like) tracks seen in *larva currens*. Urticaria is a hypersensitivity reaction and is not accompanied by eosinophilia or the specific epigastric tenderness associated with parasitic duodenitis.\\\\n\\\\n[DIAGNOSTIC CHALLENGES & TREATMENT]\\\\nContent: Diagnosis is often missed because stool ova and parasite (O&P) exams have low sensitivity (larvae are shed intermittently). Serology (IgG enzyme immunoassay) is the most sensitive screening tool for chronic cases. In the setting of hyperinfection, larvae may be found in sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. The treatment of choice is Ivermectin (200 µg/kg) for 1-2 days for uncomplicated cases. Albendazole is an alternative but is less effective.

Physical exam revealed macerated, white patches on the pressure points of the heels and forefoot, characterized by numerous tiny, shallow, \\\\\"punched-out\\\\\" depressions (1–2 mm pits). These pits coalesced in some areas to form crater-like erosions. The distinct odor is caused by sulfur compounds produced by bacteria such as *Kytococcus sedentarius* and *Dermatophilus congolensis* digesting the keratin of the stratum corneum.\\\\n\\\\n[PATHOGENESIS & RISK FACTORS]\\\\nContent: Pitted Keratolysis is a superficial bacterial infection, not fungal. The primary predisposing factor is hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) combined with occlusive footwear (boots, vinyl shoes) that prevents evaporation. This creates a warm, moist, alkaline environment where bacteria thrive.

In HAM/TSP, the virus triggers an autoimmune-like response that damages the myelin in the spinal cord.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS]\\\\nContent: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the primary mimic for HAM/TSP as both present with spasticity and bladder dysfunction. However, distinct features help differentiate them: MS typically follows a *relapsing-remitting* course (episodes of worsening followed by recovery) and involves the brain and optic nerves (optic neuritis).  MRI in MS shows classic periventricular white matter plaques (Dawson\\'s fingers), whereas HAM/TSP primarily affects the thoracic spinal cord (atrophy) and spares the brain.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: POTT\\'S DISEASE]\\\\nContent: Tuberculosis of the spine (Pott\\'s Disease) can also cause paraparesis in tropical regions. However, Pott\\'s disease is a destructive bacterial infection of the *vertebrae* (bones), often leading to a sharp angulation of the spine (gibbus deformity) and localized tenderness.  It is often accompanied by systemic signs of TB (fever, night sweats, weight loss). In contrast, HAM/TSP is a non-destructive, inflammatory myelopathy of the spinal cord substance itself, without bony involvement.\\\\n\\\\n[CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS: ATL]\\\\nContent: While this patient presents with neurological symptoms, HTLV-1 is also the causative agent of Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma (ATL). ATL is an aggressive malignancy of mature CD4+ T-cells, characterized by skin lesions (nodules/ulcers), generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and hypercalcemia (high calcium levels causing thirst/confusion). A pathognomonic finding on the blood smear is the presence of \\\\\"flower cells\\\\\"—lymphocytes with multilobulated, petal-shaped nuclei. This outcome occurs in about 5% of carriers, usually decades after infection.\"\\n}',\n",

She has not traveled internationally but recalls eating a pesto pasta salad with fresh basil and cilantro at a catered wedding event last month.  She has lost 4 kg due to anorexia. Stool microscopy with modified acid-fast staining revealed variably stained, spherical oocysts (8–10 µm in diameter), which are twice the size of *Cryptosporidium*. Under UV fluorescence microscopy, the oocysts appeared bright blue, confirming the diagnosis of *Cyclospora cayetanensis*.\\\\n\\\\n[EPIDEMIOLOGY & TRANSMISSION]\\\\nContent: *Cyclospora cayetanensis* is a coccidian parasite endemic to tropical and subtropical regions (e.g., Peru, Guatemala, Nepal). In non-endemic areas like the US and Canada, outbreaks are frequently linked to imported fresh produce such as raspberries, basil, cilantro, and snow peas.  Unlike many other protozoa, *Cyclospora* is *not* immediately infectious in fresh stool; the oocysts require days to weeks in the environment to sporulate and become infective.

A KOH preparation of the scale showed short hyphae and round yeast cells, a pattern described as \\\\\"spaghetti and meatballs,\\\\\" confirming the diagnosis.\\\\n\\\\n[PATHOPHYSIOLOGY & RISK FACTORS]\\\\nContent: Tinea Versicolor is a superficial fungal infection caused by the overgrowth of the yeast *Malassezia furfur* (part of the normal skin flora). The yeast thrives in warm, moist, and oily environments, which is why the condition is most common in young adults (active oil glands) and those living in tropical climates or who sweat excessively (hyperhidrosis).  The yeast produces azelaic acid, which inhibits melanin production, leading to the characteristic hypopigmented patches that contrast with tanned skin.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: VITILIGO]\\\\nContent: Vitiligo is the most common mimic of the hypopigmented variety of Tinea Versicolor. However, Vitiligo presents with *complete* depigmentation (chalk-white macules) rather than just lighter skin.  Crucially, Vitiligo lesions are smooth and lack the fine scale seen in Tinea Versicolor. Vitiligo is an autoimmune destruction of melanocytes, often affecting the face and hands, whereas Tinea Versicolor typically favors the sebaceous-rich areas of the trunk (back/chest) and is caused by a fungus.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: PITYRIASIS ROSEA]\\\\nContent: Pityriasis Rosea is another papulosquamous eruption that affects the trunk.

However, HSV typically presents with a prodrome of tingling or burning before the vesicles appear. The vesicles in HSV are usually grouped (herpetiform) on a red base and are painful, whereas Impetigo lesions are often pruritic (itchy) but less painful (unless ecthyma develops) and lack the viral prodrome. A Tzanck smear or viral PCR can confirm HSV if the diagnosis is unclear.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: CONTACT DERMATITIS]\\\\nContent: Allergic Contact Dermatitis (e.g., Poison Ivy) can cause weeping vesicles and crusting. However, the distribution is usually linear or geometric (corresponding to the contact agent) rather than the clustered, expanding pattern of impetigo. Furthermore, contact dermatitis is intensely pruritic but does not typically produce the thick, golden, \\\\\"stuck-on\\\\\" crusts seen in bacterial impetigo, and it is not contagious person-to-person.\\\\n\\\\n[TREATMENT & COMPLICATIONS]\\\\nContent: Localized impetigo is treated with topical antibiotics such as Mupirocin (Bactroban) or Retapamulin ointment applied three times daily.

The patient is in distress but has no systemic symptoms like difficulty breathing, chest pain, or muscle cramps (which would raise concern for Irukandji syndrome or Box Jellyfish).\\\\n\\\\n[PATHOPHYSIOLOGY & NEMATOCYSTS]\\\\nContent: Jellyfish have tentacles armed with thousands of microscopic stinging cells called *nematocysts*. When a tentacle brushes against skin, these cells trigger a spring-loaded mechanism, firing barbed threads (tubules) that inject venom into the victim.  This process occurs in a fraction of a second and can happen even if the tentacle is detached from the jellyfish or if the jellyfish is dead on the beach.

However, vinegar should *not* be used for Portuguese Man-of-War stings, as it can stimulate venom release.\\\\n3. **Heat vs. Cold:** Immersion in hot water (40-45°C) or hot packs is effective for pain relief as heat degrades the venom proteins. Ice packs can also be used if heat is unavailable.\\\\n4. **Myth Buster:** Do *not* urinate on the sting.

Interestingly, his left hand is completely spared. He also reports chronic peeling and itching between the toes of *both* feet (Tinea Pedis). This clinical presentation of bilateral foot infection paired with unilateral hand involvement is classically known as \\\\\"Two Feet-One Hand Syndrome.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n[ETIOLOGY & TRANSMISSION]\\\\nContent: Tinea Manuum is a dermatophyte infection caused by fungi such as *Trichophyton rubrum*, *Trichophyton mentagrophytes*, or *Epidermophyton floccosum*. These fungi thrive in warm, humid environments (locker rooms, showers) and feed on keratin in the outer skin layer. Transmission occurs via direct contact with infected people, animals (zoophilic species), or soil, but often involves autoinoculation—scratching infected feet (Tinea Pedis) with the dominant hand, leading to infection of that hand while the other remains clear.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: HAND ECZEMA]\\\\nContent: Hand Eczema (Dermatitis) is the most common mimic. However, eczema is typically *bilateral* (affecting both hands) and presents with weeping vesicles, intense itching, and no clear central clearing.

A trial of an antihistamine (H1 blocker) before meals provided partial relief, and a low-histamine diet resulted in significant symptom reduction.\\\\n\\\\n[PATHOPHYSIOLOGY]\\\\nContent: Histamine Intolerance is not an IgE-mediated allergy but a metabolic disorder. It is hypothesized to be caused by a deficiency or impaired activity of the enzyme **Diamine Oxidase (DAO)**, which is responsible for breaking down dietary histamine in the gut.

It typically triggers an immediate, reproducible reaction (hives, anaphylaxis) upon exposure to even tiny amounts of the allergen. In contrast, Histamine Intolerance is dose-dependent (cumulative) and can vary based on other factors like stress or alcohol intake.

The most common species affecting humans are *Clonorchis sinensis* (Chinese liver fluke) and *Opisthorchis viverrini* (Southeast Asian liver fluke). Infection is acquired by ingesting encysted larvae (metacercariae) in raw or undercooked freshwater fish.  Once ingested, the larvae excyst in the duodenum and migrate up the Ampulla of Vater into the bile ducts, where they mature into adults. Chronic inflammation from long-standing infection (often lasting decades) causes periductal fibrosis and is a major risk factor for **Cholangiocarcinoma** (bile duct cancer).\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: FASCIOLIASIS]\\\\nContent: *Fasciola hepatica* (Sheep Liver Fluke) is another important fluke but has a different transmission route. Unlike *Clonorchis*, which comes from fish, *Fasciola* is acquired by eating contaminated aquatic plants like **watercress**.  Clinically, the acute phase of Fascioliasis is often more severe, characterized by high fever, intense RUQ pain, and marked eosinophilia as the immature worms migrate *through* the liver parenchyma (hepatic phase) before settling in the ducts. Treatment also differs: *Fasciola* responds to Triclabendazole, whereas *Clonorchis* requires Praziquantel.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: CHOLEDOCHOLITHIASIS]\\\\nContent: Common bile duct stones (choledocholithiasis) frequently present with RUQ pain, jaundice, and dilated ducts. However, stones typically cause acute, colicky pain and may be visible as echogenic foci with shadowing on ultrasound.

She has no diarrhea, weight loss, or abdominal pain. Her mother reports that several children at her daycare have had \\\\\"worms.\\\\\"  A \\\\\"Scotch Tape Test\\\\\" was performed by pressing clear adhesive tape against the perianal skin in the morning; microscopy revealed characteristic flattened, asymmetrical eggs, confirming Enterobiasis. This presentation is distinct from protozoan infections like Giardia, which primarily cause diarrhea rather than isolated pruritus.\\\\n\\\\n[CLASSIFICATION: HELMINTHS VS PROTOZOA]\\\\nContent: Intestinal parasites are broadly categorized into two groups: \\\\n1. **Helminths (Worms):** Multicellular organisms visible to the naked eye. This group includes Roundworms (Nematodes) like *Pinworms*, *Ascaris*, and *Hookworms*, as well as Flatworms like *Tapeworms* (Cestodes) and *Flukes*. They typically spread via soil contaminated with feces or ingestion of undercooked meat/fish.\\\\n2. **Protozoa:** Single-celled microscopic organisms. Common examples include *Giardia*, *Cryptosporidium*, and *Entamoeba histolytica*. These are often waterborne or foodborne and are more likely to cause explosive diarrhea and dehydration compared to the often asymptomatic or nutritional-deficiency presentation of worms.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: GIARDIASIS]\\\\nContent: *Giardia duodenalis* is the most common protozoan parasite in the US. Unlike Pinworms (which cause itching), Giardiasis presents with foul-smelling, greasy diarrhea (steatorrhea), bloating, and gas.  It is typically acquired from contaminated water sources (lakes, streams) and does not cause the nocturnal anal pruritus seen in Enterobiasis. Diagnosis requires a Stool Ova & Parasite (O&P) exam or antigen testing, as the tape test is useless for protozoa.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: TAPEWORM]\\\\nContent: Tapeworms (*Taenia* species) are segmented flatworms acquired from undercooked beef or pork. Patients are often asymptomatic but may pass visible white, rice-like segments (proglottids) in their stool, which can be alarming.  Unlike the microscopic eggs of pinworms found on perianal skin, tapeworm diagnosis relies on identifying these segments or eggs in the feces. Heavy infestations can lead to weight loss and malnutrition.\\\\n\\\\n[TREATMENT & PREVENTION]\\\\nContent: Treatment depends on the organism. For Pinworms, a single dose of Pyrantel Pamoate or Albendazole is given, repeated in 2 weeks to kill newly hatched eggs. For Protozoa like Giardia, Metronidazole is the standard. Prevention centers on hygiene: washing hands to remove microscopic eggs (which can survive on surfaces/linens), wearing shoes to prevent Hookworm entry through skin, and drinking only clean/bottled water in high-risk areas.\"\\n}',\n",

He recalls being bitten frequently by large, day-biting flies during his trip. A blood smear taken at noon (to match the parasite\\'s diurnal periodicity) revealed sheathed microfilariae, confirming *Loa loa* infection.\\\\n\\\\n[VECTOR & EPIDEMIOLOGY]\\\\nContent: The causative agent is the nematode *Loa loa*, transmitted by the bite of the *Chrysops* fly (Deer fly or Mango fly). These flies breed in the high-canopy rainforests of West and Central Africa.  Unlike mosquitoes which are often nocturnal, *Chrysops* flies are diurnal (day-biting). The adult worms migrate through the subcutaneous tissues of humans, occasionally crossing the subconjunctival space of the eye, which is the most dramatic clinical sign. They do not cause blindness (unlike Onchocerciasis) but cause significant irritation and psychological distress.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: ONCHOCERCIASIS]\\\\nContent: Onchocerciasis (River Blindness) is another filarial disease found in similar African regions. However, it is transmitted by *Simulium* blackflies, not deer flies. Clinically, Onchocerciasis causes severe dermatitis (\\\\\"leopard skin\\\\\"), subcutaneous nodules (onchocercomas), and keratitis that leads to permanent *blindness*.  In contrast, *Loa loa* does not typically damage the vision permanently. Furthermore, *Onchocerca volvulus* microfilariae are found in skin snips, whereas *Loa loa* microfilariae are found in the blood.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: MANSONELLOSIS]\\\\nContent: *Mansonella perstans* is often co-endemic in Central Africa. It is transmitted by midges (*Culicoides*). Infections are often asymptomatic or cause mild itching and angioedema.  Crucially, *Mansonella* microfilariae are smaller and lack a sheath, distinguishing them from the larger, sheathed *Loa loa* on a blood smear. Treatment also differs, as *Mansonella* is often resistant to standard filaricides.\\\\n\\\\n[TREATMENT & PRECAUTIONS]\\\\nContent: The treatment of choice is Diethylcarbamazine (DEC), which kills both adult worms and microfilariae. However, in patients with a very high microfilarial load (>8,000/mL), rapid killing of the parasites can cause a fatal encephalopathy. Therefore, patients must be screened first. If the load is high, Albendazole or apheresis is used to lower the count before starting DEC.

Physical exam reveals multiple tense, clear fluid-filled bullae on an erythematous/urticarial base. Crucially, applying lateral pressure to the skin next to a blister does *not* cause the skin to slough off (Negative Nikolsky Sign).\\\\n\\\\n[EPIDEMIOLOGY & PATHOPHYSIOLOGY]\\\\nContent: Bullous Pemphigoid is a rare autoimmune blistering disease that primarily affects the elderly (typically over 60, with incidence rising sharply after 80). It occurs when the immune system attacks the basement membrane zone (the layer between the epidermis and dermis), specifically targeting hemidesmosome proteins.  Triggers can include certain medications (like gliptins for diabetes), UV light, or radiation. It is associated with neurological conditions such as dementia, Parkinson\\'s disease, and stroke.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: PEMPHIGUS VULGARIS]\\\\nContent: Pemphigus Vulgaris is the primary differential but has distinct features. It affects a younger demographic (40s-60s) and almost always starts with painful *oral* erosions (mucous membrane involvement), which are present in only about 33% of Bullous Pemphigoid cases.  The blisters in Pemphigus are flaccid (soft) and rupture very easily due to the superficial level of separation (intra-epidermal). Consequently, patients often present with erosions rather than intact blisters, and they exhibit a *Positive* Nikolsky Sign (skin shears off with pressure).\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: ECZEMA/HIVES]\\\\nContent: In the early \\\\\"pre-bullous\\\\\" phase, Bullous Pemphigoid often presents as itchy, red welts that resemble hives (urticaria) or eczema. This can lead to misdiagnosis before the characteristic blisters appear. However, unlike standard hives which are transient (lasting <24 hours), the urticarial plaques of Bullous Pemphigoid are fixed and persist for days to weeks before blistering. Eczema typically lacks the distinct tense bullae found in established pemphigoid.\\\\n\\\\n[TREATMENT & PROGNOSIS]\\\\nContent: The condition is generally self-limiting but may last up to 5 years. Treatment focuses on suppressing the immune response. For mild cases, potent topical corticosteroids are the first line. Moderate-to-severe cases require oral corticosteroids (Prednisone) often combined with steroid-sparing agents like Dapsone, Methotrexate, or Azathioprine. Tetracycline/Doxycycline is an alternative for those who cannot tolerate steroids.

His history of uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes is a significant contributing factor, creating a bidirectional relationship where the gum disease worsens his blood sugar control.\\\\n\\\\n[PATHOPHYSIOLOGY]\\\\nContent: Periodontitis is a chronic bacterial infection that destroys the supporting structures of the teeth (periodontium). It begins as Gingivitis, where plaque bacteria cause superficial inflammation. If untreated, the plaque calcifies into tartar (calculus), which pushes the gums away from the teeth, forming \\\\\"pockets.\\\\\"  The body\\'s immune response to these bacteria releases enzymes that break down the periodontal ligament and alveolar bone.

Both present with red, bleeding gums. However, the key distinction is **bone loss**. In Gingivitis, the inflammation is confined to the soft tissue, and the teeth remain firmly anchored with no radiographic evidence of bone destruction.  Probing depths in gingivitis are generally <4 mm (pseudo-pockets due to swelling), whereas Periodontitis is defined by true pathological pockets >4 mm and clinical attachment loss.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: DENTAL ABSCESS]\\\\nContent: A Periodontal Abscess can occur as a complication of periodontitis but presents acutely. It manifests as a localized, painful, fluctuant swelling on the gum, often with purulent discharge (pus) upon pressure.  While Periodontitis is often a dull, chronic ache or painless, an abscess causes sharp, intense pain and may be accompanied by fever and lymphadenopathy.\\\\n\\\\n[TREATMENT & MANAGEMENT]\\\\nContent: Standard brushing and flossing are insufficient once pockets form because they cannot reach deep enough. The gold standard initial treatment is **Scaling and Root Planing (SRP)**, often called a \\\\\"deep cleaning.\\\\\" This involves mechanically removing the subgingival tartar and smoothing the root surfaces to allow the gums to reattach.

She reports the pain is \\\\\"mechanical\\\\\" in nature: it worsens with activity (like climbing stairs or walking long distances) and improves with rest.  She describes a \\\\\"gelling phenomenon\\\\\" where her joints feel stiff after sitting for long periods, but this stiffness resolves within 15–20 minutes of moving around (Morning Stiffness < 30 mins). Physical exam reveals palpable **crepitus** (grating sensation) upon knee flexion/extension and bony enlargement, but no significant warmth or erythema. Her BMI is 32, which is a significant modifiable risk factor.\\\\n\\\\n[PATHOPHYSIOLOGY]\\\\nContent: Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis, characterized by the progressive breakdown of articular cartilage.  Unlike the synovial inflammation seen in autoimmune forms, OA is primarily a \\\\\"wear and tear\\\\\" process where the shock-absorbing cartilage wears away, eventually leading to bone-on-bone friction. This stimulates the formation of new bone at the joint margins, known as **osteophytes** (bone spurs), which contribute to the limited range of motion and pain.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS]\\\\nContent: Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is the primary differential to rule out. RA is an autoimmune disease that causes systemic inflammation. Crucially, RA pain is often worse in the morning with stiffness lasting **longer than 1 hour**, whereas OA stiffness typically resolves in <30 minutes. RA also tends to affect smaller joints (MCPs, PIPs) symmetrically and presents with soft, spongy swelling (synovitis) and warmth, rather than the hard, bony enlargement (Heberden\\'s and Bouchard\\'s nodes) seen in OA.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: GOUT]\\\\nContent: Gout can also cause joint pain but typically presents as an acute, monoarticular flare (e.g., sudden, intense pain in the big toe or knee) with marked redness and heat due to urate crystal deposition. OA is a chronic, slowly progressive condition without the acute inflammatory signs of a gout flare. Aspiration of the joint fluid in OA would show clear, yellow fluid with a low white blood cell count, unlike the cloudy, crystal-laden fluid of gout.\\\\n\\\\n[MANAGEMENT]\\\\nContent: Management focuses on symptom relief and function preservation. Initial treatment is conservative: **Weight loss** and low-impact exercise (swimming, cycling) are the most effective interventions to reduce load on weight-bearing joints. Pharmacologic therapy includes Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or NSAIDs (Ibuprofen) for pain, and topical agents (Voltaren gel). Corticosteroid injections can provide temporary relief. For end-stage disease with severe functional limitation, Total Joint Arthroplasty (knee replacement) is the definitive treatment.\"\\n}',\n",

The fungus invades the keratin of the nail unit, often starting at the distal edge and spreading proximally (Distal Subungual Onychomycosis).  The infection thrives in warm, moist environments (sweaty socks, locker rooms) and feeds on the keratin protein, leading to the characteristic subungual hyperkeratosis (thickening) and debris accumulation.

Acute radiation proctitis occurs during treatment, while chronic radiation proctitis can present months or years later with bleeding due to telangiectasias (fragile blood vessels).\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: HEMORRHOIDS]\\\\nContent: Internal Hemorrhoids are the most frequent cause of bright red rectal bleeding. However, hemorrhoidal bleeding is typically painless and occurs *at the end* of a bowel movement (dripping into the toilet).  Unlike proctitis, hemorrhoids do not cause the intense inflammation, tenesmus, or purulent/mucus discharge seen in proctitis. Anoscopy can visualize the enlarged venous cushions of hemorrhoids, whereas proctitis shows a diffuse, red, friable mucosal surface.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: ANAL FISSURE]\\\\nContent: An Anal Fissure is a tear in the lining of the anal canal.

The clinical presentation depends entirely on the host\\'s immune status:\\\\n1.  **Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA):** A hypersensitivity reaction in patients with asthma or Cystic Fibrosis, leading to airway inflammation, bronchiectasis, and mucus plugging.\\\\n2.  **Aspergilloma:** A \\\\\"fungus ball\\\\\" that grows in a pre-existing lung cavity (e.g., from old TB or sarcoidosis). It is often asymptomatic but can cause life-threatening hemoptysis (coughing up blood).\\\\n3.  **Invasive Aspergillosis:** A severe, often fatal infection where the fungus invades blood vessels and spreads to other organs (brain, kidneys). This occurs almost exclusively in severely immunocompromised patients (e.g., bone marrow transplant recipients, prolonged neutropenia).\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: INVASIVE ASPERGILLOSIS]\\\\nContent: Invasive Aspergillosis is the most critical differential but affects a different demographic. It presents with high fever, pleuritic chest pain, and severe dyspnea in a patient with profound neutropenia or on high-dose immunosuppression.  A key radiographic feature is the \\\\\"halo sign\\\\\" (nodule with ground-glass opacity) on CT, which is absent in ABPA.

An Aspergilloma is a specific form of CPA where a fungal ball forms within a cavity.\\\\n\\\\n[TREATMENT & MANAGEMENT]\\\\nContent: Treatment varies by type. \\\\n* **ABPA:** The mainstay is **oral corticosteroids** (e.g., Prednisone) to reduce the allergic inflammation and prevent permanent lung damage (fibrosis/bronchiectasis). Antifungals like Itraconazole may be added to reduce the fungal burden and allow for steroid tapering.\\\\n* **Aspergilloma:** Often requires no treatment unless symptomatic (hemoptysis), in which case surgical resection or bronchial artery embolization is performed.\\\\n* **Invasive:** Requires urgent treatment with **Voriconazole** (first-line), Isavuconazole, or Amphotericin B.\"\\n}',\n",

He had been previously diagnosed with \\\\\"severe eczema\\\\\" and treated with potent topical corticosteroids for years with minimal improvement. Recently, the lesions have thickened and become more palpable.  Physical examination revealed well-demarcated, scaly, erythematous plaques with irregular borders distributed in a \\\\\"bathing trunk\\\\\" pattern (non-sun-exposed areas). There was no generalized redness (erythroderma) or palpable lymphadenopathy. A punch biopsy of a thickened plaque revealed an infiltrate of atypical T-lymphocytes, confirming the diagnosis.\\\\n\\\\n[PATHOPHYSIOLOGY & STAGING]\\\\nContent: Mycosis Fungoides (MF) is the most common form of Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL). It is a blood cancer where malignant T-cells (lymphocytes) home to the skin. The disease progresses slowly through distinct phases:\\\\n1.  **Premycotic/Patch Phase:** Flat, scaly, red patches that resemble eczema or psoriasis. Often misdiagnosed for years.\\\\n2.  **Plaque Phase:** Lesions become raised, thicker, and harder.\\\\n3.  **Tumor Phase:** Large, mushroom-like nodules form, which may ulcerate and become infected.\\\\nUnlike skin cancer (which arises from skin cells), this is a malignancy of the immune system manifesting in the skin.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: ECZEMA/PSORIASIS]\\\\nContent: The early patch stage of MF is clinically indistinguishable from Atopic Dermatitis (Eczema) or Psoriasis. However, Eczema typically responds well to corticosteroids and often affects flexural areas (antecubital fossa), while Psoriasis presents with thick silvery scales on extensor surfaces (elbows/knees). The key clue for MF is the **persistence** of the rash despite standard treatment and its predilection for **sun-protected** areas (buttocks/breasts).\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: SÉZARY SYNDROME]\\\\nContent: Sézary Syndrome is the leukemic, aggressive variant of CTCL. Unlike the localized plaques of MF, Sézary Syndrome presents with **Erythroderma** (diffuse, bright red rash covering >80% of the body) and severe exfoliation.  It is characterized by the presence of malignant T-cells (**Sézary cells**) circulating in the bloodstream, which is less common in early-stage MF.\\\\n\\\\n[TREATMENT & PROGNOSIS]\\\\nContent: Treatment is stage-dependent. Early-stage (skin-limited) disease is managed with **Skin-Directed Therapies**: topical corticosteroids, topical chemotherapy (Mechlorethamine gel), or **Phototherapy** (PUVA or UVB light). Systemic therapies (Retinoids like Bexarotene, Methotrexate, or Interferon) are reserved for advanced or refractory disease. The prognosis for early-stage MF is excellent, with a normal life expectancy, but advanced stages with tumor or lymph node involvement have a poorer outlook.\"\\n}',\n",

Step 4) VERIFY AGAINST CLINICAL KNOWLEDGE/GUIDELINES (replacing incubation/transmission for non-infectious conditions): - Reference: Atypical Presentation of ACS in Women: Women frequently present with non-classical symptoms such as fatigue, dyspnea, nausea, jaw/neck/back pain, and palpitations, rather than the classic crushing substernal chest pain. → Patient\\'s jaw pain, fatigue, and palpitations strongly align with this. - Reference: Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease: Type 2 Diabetes is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis and can lead to autonomic neuropathy, resulting in \"silent ischemia\" or atypical symptoms of ACS. → Patient\\'s diabetes supports the likelihood of atypical presentation of a cardiac event. - Reference: Exertional Symptoms: Symptoms (chest pain, dyspnea) that are consistently provoked by exertion (walking upstairs) and relieved by rest are characteristic of stable angina. → Patient\\'s dyspnea on exertion is a key indicator. - Reference: Chest Pain Quality: \"Pressure\" is a common descriptor for anginal chest pain. → Patient\\'s \"persistent pressure\" aligns.

SOB due to severe anemia leading to high-output cardiac failure. Low-grade fever possible. * *Mismatch:* While many symptoms align, *persistent perianal itching* is not a classic or prominent symptom of hookworm infection. Skin darkening could occur from chronic inflammation, but the specific pattern of \"redness and tenderness\" with perianal itching points more strongly to larva migrans. * **Chagas Disease (Trypanosoma cruzi):** * *Match:* Tropical region.

Autoinfection often leads to larva currens in the perianal/buttock region. Chronic scratching can lead to hyperpigmentation and inflammatory changes. * Shortness of breath, cardiac involvement: Yes, pulmonary involvement (pneumonitis) is common in disseminated strongyloidiasis.

It perfectly fits the diagnostic criteria for delirium. ✗ RULES OUT Dementia: Dementia typically has an insidious onset, progressive course, and generally a stable level of consciousness (until very late stages). The acute onset and fluctuating course here are not typical of primary dementia. ✗ RULES OUT Primary Psychotic Disorder (e.g., Schizophrenia): While hallucinations and disorganized thinking are present, the fluctuating level of consciousness, disorientation, and acute global cognitive impairment are not characteristic of a primary psychotic disorder, where consciousness and orientation are usually preserved. ✗ RULES OUT Encephalitis (as the sole diagnosis): While encephalitis can cause altered mental status, confusion, and seizures, the *fluctuating* nature of consciousness and attention, coupled with the rapid onset, points more specifically to delirium as the *syndrome* rather than just brain inflammation, though encephalitis could be an underlying *cause* of the delirium. ✓ CONSIDER Cerebral Malaria (as a potential underlying cause of delirium): Given the travel history, cerebral malaria is a critical differential for the *cause* of this delirium, but the *symptom constellation itself* is delirium. The question asks \"What could be causing this collection of symptoms?\" and delirium is the descriptive syndrome. If the question were \"What is the *underlying etiology* of this condition?\", cerebral malaria would be a prime candidate. Step 4) VERIFY AGAINST REFERENCES (Implicit understanding of Delirium): - Delirium is an acute brain dysfunction characterized by a disturbance in attention and awareness that develops over a short period (hours to days) and tends to fluctuate in severity. All patient symptoms align perfectly with this definition. - The symptoms observed (disorientation, muddled thinking, hallucinations, fluctuating consciousness, memory impairment, anxiety/irritability) are core features of delirium. - The history of travel to a malaria-endemic region provides a potential precipitating factor (e.g., malaria, other infection, dehydration, drug effect) which is always present in delirium (delirium is a *syndrome*, not a primary disease). Conclusion: The patient\\'s symptoms are a textbook presentation of delirium, an acute neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by a fluctuating disturbance in attention, awareness, and cognition. The travel history suggests potential underlying infectious etiologies, such as cerebral malaria, as a cause for the delirium.'},\n",

While classic malaria often has paroxysmal fevers, persistent fever can occur, especially in severe or untreated cases. Fatigue and weight loss are indicative of systemic illness and anemia. * **Abdominal discomfort**: Can be associated with hepatosplenomegaly, common in malaria. * **Jaundice**: A critical symptom. Severe malaria can cause jaundice due to massive hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells by parasites), impaired liver function, or both. ✗ RULES OUT other acute transfusion reactions: Timeline \"weeks after\" rules out immediate reactions (e.g., TRALI, TACO, acute hemolytic reaction). ✗ RULES OUT HIV (as the *primary* cause of all listed symptoms here): While HIV transmission via transfusion is possible and causes fever, fatigue, weight loss, jaundice is not a primary symptom of acute HIV (though it can occur secondary to opportunistic infections or drug side effects in later stages). The *prominence* of jaundice points more directly to conditions causing significant hemolysis or liver damage as a primary effect. ✗ RULES OUT Viral Hepatitis (B or C) (as the *primary* cause of all listed symptoms here): While Hepatitis causes fever, fatigue, weight loss, abdominal discomfort, and jaundice and is transfusion-transmitted, the prompt specifically directs to \"Malaria\" as the answer, implying a more direct fit of the *constellation* to malaria. Step 4) VERIFY AGAINST REFERENCES (if applicable - here, using general medical knowledge for malaria): - Reference: **Transfusion-transmitted malaria** incubation period can range from days to several weeks/months depending on parasite load and species. \"Weeks after\" fits this. - Reference: **Malaria endemicity**: Patient resides in a high malaria prevalence region, making transfusion-transmitted malaria a significant concern if blood screening protocols are not fully robust, or if infected blood slipped through. - Reference: **Malaria symptoms**: Fever, profound fatigue, and weight loss are all consistent with systemic malaria infection, particularly severe or prolonged cases. - Reference: **Malaria complications**: Jaundice is a known severe complication of malaria (especially P. falciparum), often due to massive hemolysis of infected red blood cells and potential liver involvement.

The \"unexplained\" nature suggests an acquired rather than congenital or typical chronic condition. - Epidemiology: Travel to Central America is a critical epidemiological clue. This region is highly endemic for parasitic infections, particularly *Taenia solium* (pork tapeworm), which causes cysticercosis. - Incubation Period: Highly variable for neurocysticercosis (NCC), often months to years, as symptoms typically arise when cysts degenerate, causing inflammation. \"Recently traveled\" is consistent with this variable timeline, as infection can be asymptomatic for long periods. - Risk Factors: Exposure to contaminated food/water (containing *Taenia solium* eggs) in an endemic area. This is a common risk for travelers. Step 3) PATTERN MATCHING: ✓ MATCHES Cysticercosis (specifically Neurocysticercosis - NCC): - **Symptoms:** New-onset seizures are the most common clinical presentation of NCC in adults. Chronic headaches, visual disturbances (due to hydrocephalus or direct ocular involvement), and focal neurological deficits are also classic manifestations, depending on cyst location within the brain. - **Epidemiology:** Endemic in Central America. The patient\\'s travel history aligns perfectly with acquisition in this region. - **Pathophysiology:** Ingested *Taenia solium* eggs hatch, and larvae disseminate, forming cysts in various tissues, most notably the brain (NCC). Symptoms often manifest when these cysts die, triggering an inflammatory response. ✗ RULES OUT other common neurological conditions (without specific external reference here, but implied by the strong match with cysticercosis and travel): - Stroke: Typically sudden onset, often lacks the \"unexplained seizure\" component as primary presentation. - Brain Tumor: Possible, but travel history points strongly towards an infectious/parasitic etiology. No other systemic malignancy signs. - Meningitis/Encephalitis: Often presents with fever, nuchal rigidity, more acute and diffuse altered mental status. While possible in some chronic forms, the constellation of symptoms here strongly favors NCC. Step 4) VERIFY AGAINST REFERENCES (Assuming reference for Cysticercosis): - Reference (Cysticercosis/Neurocysticercosis - NCC): - **Epidemiology:** Highly prevalent in Central and South America, sub-Saharan Africa, and parts of Asia. Transmitted via fecal-oral route by ingesting *Taenia solium* eggs (often from contaminated food/water, not directly from undercooked pork). - **Clinical Presentation:** Seizures (up to 70% of cases), chronic headaches, hydrocephalus, focal neurological deficits (weakness, sensory changes), visual disturbances (ocular cysts or increased intracranial pressure). - **Incubation:** Can be months to years, as symptoms often occur when the cysts degenerate and cause an inflammatory reaction. - Patient Fit: - **Geography/Exposure:** Patient\\'s travel to Central America perfectly aligns with endemic regions for *Taenia solium* infection and subsequent NCC. - **Symptoms:** The patient\\'s new-onset seizures, severe headaches, visual disturbances, and focal neurological deficits are classic and the most common presentations of NCC. - **Timeline:** \"Recently traveled\" is consistent with the variable and often delayed incubation period of NCC. Conclusion: The patient\\'s clinical presentation, specifically the new-onset seizures and other neurological symptoms combined with a travel history to Central America, is a classic and textbook case of Neurocysticercosis, fitting the known epidemiology and symptomology of the disease perfectly.'},\n",

Review of immunization history showed he had missed his second MMR dose. Respiratory isolation was implemented immediately.\\\\n\\\\n[VIROLOGY & TRANSMISSION]\\\\nContent: Mumps is caused by a paramyxovirus, a single-stranded RNA virus. Transmission occurs primarily through direct contact with respiratory droplets, saliva, or contaminated fomites. The incubation period typically ranges from 16 to 18 days. Patients are most contagious from 2 days before to 5 days after the onset of parotitis. Unlike measles, which is airborne, mumps requires closer contact for transmission, facilitating outbreaks in crowded settings like university dormitories or military barracks.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: BACTERIAL PAROTITIS]\\\\nContent: Acute Suppurative Parotitis is a key differential that must be ruled out. It is typically caused by *Staphylococcus aureus* and predominantly affects elderly, dehydrated, or post-operative patients (unlike the young, healthy demographic of Mumps). Clinically, it presents as *unilateral* swelling with intense erythema and warmth.

Today, she developed a sudden drooping of the left side of her face (*Bell\\'s palsy*). Given the endemic exposure and pathognomonic rash, a diagnosis of Lyme disease was made clinically, and Doxycycline was initiated.\\\\n\\\\n[VECTOR BIOLOGY & TRANSMISSION]\\\\nContent: The primary vector for Lyme disease in the northeastern and upper midwestern United States is the blacklegged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), also known as the deer tick. Transmission of the spirochete *Borrelia burgdorferi* typically requires the tick to be attached for at least 36–48 hours. Nymphal ticks, which are the size of a poppy seed, are responsible for the majority of human cases during late spring and summer because they are difficult to detect. Adult ticks are more active in cooler months but are larger and easier to remove before transmission occurs.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: STARI]\\\\nContent: Southern Tick-Associated Rash Illness (STARI) is a key differential for patients presenting with a bullseye rash in the southeastern United States (e.g., Missouri, Tennessee). Unlike Lyme, STARI is transmitted by the Lone Star tick (*Amblyomma americanum*) and is not caused by *B. burgdorferi*. While the rash (*erythema migrans*-like) is visually similar, STARI does not progress to the chronic neurological or arthritic complications seen in untreated Lyme disease. Differentiation often relies on geography and identification of the tick vector.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: CELLULITIS]\\\\nContent: Cellulitis is a common bacterial skin infection (usually *Strep* or *Staph*) that can mimic the redness of Lyme. However, distinct features help differentiate them: Cellulitis is typically intensely painful, warm to the touch, and swollen (indurated), often with a breakdown in the skin barrier (e.g., a cut).  In contrast, the Lyme rash (*erythema migrans*) is usually painless or only mildly itchy, not warm, and expands rapidly over days, often developing ring-like central clearing rather than diffuse, tender redness.\\\\n\\\\n[EPIDEMIOLOGY & RISK]\\\\nContent: Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne illness in the United States. High-risk areas include the Northeast (from Virginia to Maine), the Upper Midwest (Wisconsin, Minnesota), and the Pacific Coast (Northern California). Incidence peaks in June and July. Risk factors include gardening, hiking in brushy/wooded areas, and having pets that may carry ticks into the home.

He recently returned from a 6-month work assignment in Southern India.  He reports his stools are pale, voluminous, foul-smelling, and difficult to flush (*steatorrhea*), indicating fat malabsorption. Laboratory workup revealed severe macrocytic anemia (Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, MCV 115 fL) due to combined folate and Vitamin B12 deficiency. Stool cultures for standard pathogens were negative, but the clinical picture of chronic malabsorption following extended tropical residence strongly supports Tropical Sprue.\\\\n\\\\n[PATHOPHYSIOLOGY]\\\\nContent: The condition is characterized by the blunting of villi and inflammation of the small intestine lining (*enterocytes*), leading to the malabsorption of nutrients. Unlike Celiac disease, which affects the proximal small bowel, Tropical Sprue often involves the entire small intestine, disproportionately affecting the distal ileum where Vitamin B12 is absorbed. The exact etiology is believed to be a persistent bacterial overgrowth (e.g., *Klebsiella*, *E. coli*) causing mucosal damage. Treatment involves a prolonged course of tetracycline and folate supplementation.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: CELIAC DISEASE]\\\\nContent: Celiac Disease (Gluten-sensitive enteropathy) presents with nearly identical histological findings (villous atrophy) and symptoms of malabsorption. However, it is an autoimmune reaction to gluten, not an infectious process.  Differentiation is key: Celiac disease patients test positive for specific autoantibodies (Anti-tissue Transglutaminase IgA, Anti-Endomysial), whereas Tropical Sprue patients are seronegative. Furthermore, Celiac disease typically does not respond to antibiotics, whereas Tropical Sprue does.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: GIARDIASIS]\\\\nContent: *Giardia lamblia* is a protozoan parasite that causes \\\\\"beaver fever,\\\\\" a common cause of traveler\\'s diarrhea.

He lived in rural Cameroon near fast-flowing rivers for 5 years.  He noted firm, non-tender lumps under his skin (*onchocercomata*) over his hips and ribs. Recently, he has developed photophobia and blurry vision in his right eye. Slit-lamp examination revealed microfilariae swimming in the anterior chamber. The combination of chronic dermatitis, subcutaneous nodules, and ocular symptoms in a patient with long-term exposure to *Simulium* blackflies is diagnostic for Onchocerciasis.\\\\n\\\\n[VECTOR & TRANSMISSION]\\\\nContent: The disease is caused by the filarial nematode *Onchocerca volvulus* and is transmitted by the bite of the *Simulium* blackfly. Unlike mosquitoes, these flies breed in highly oxygenated, fast-flowing rivers and streams (hence \\\\\"River Blindness\\\\\"). They bite during the day. Infection typically requires repeated exposure over months or years, making it rare in casual tourists but common in long-term expatriates or agricultural workers in endemic zones like sub-Saharan Africa and parts of South America (e.g., Brazil/Venezuela border).\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: LOIASIS]\\\\nContent: Loiasis (African Eye Worm) is another filarial disease found in similar West/Central African rainforests. It is transmitted by the Chrysops fly (deer fly). A key clinical distinction is the presence of \\\\\"Calabar swellings\\\\\" (transient, migratory angioedema) in Loiasis, which are absent in Onchocerciasis. While *Loa loa* can also migrate across the eye (subconjunctival), it rarely causes the permanent sclerosing keratitis and blindness associated with *Onchocerca volvulus*.  Additionally, Loiasis often presents with high-grade eosinophilia but less severe chronic dermatitis.\\\\n\\\\n[DIAGNOSTICS]\\\\nContent: The gold standard for diagnosis is the \\\\\"skin snip\\\\\" biopsy. A small, bloodless shaving of skin (usually from the iliac crest or scapula) is incubated in saline to allow microfilariae to emerge and be visualized under a microscope.  Newer diagnostic tools include PCR of skin scratch samples and the Ov16 antibody rapid test, which is useful for surveillance. In patients with ocular symptoms, a slit-lamp exam is critical to assess worm burden in the eye before initiating treatment.\\\\n\\\\n[MANAGEMENT & MAZZOTTI REACTION]\\\\nContent: Treatment involves Ivermectin, which kills the microfilariae (larvae) but not the adult worms. Since adult worms live for 10-15 years, treatment must be repeated annually or semi-annually to suppress reproduction. A major concern during treatment is the \\\\\"Mazzotti reaction\\\\\"—an acute inflammatory response to dying microfilariae, presenting with fever, hives, swollen lymph nodes, and worsening ocular inflammation.

It presents with similar bilateral leg swelling and skin thickening. However, it is *not* caused by parasites or mosquitoes but by a geochemical reaction to silicate particles in red volcanic soil entering through bare feet.

He also complains of poor night vision and easy bruising. Physical exam revealed temporal wasting and dry, scaly skin. Lab results showed low levels of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) and a prolonged Prothrombin Time (due to Vitamin K deficiency). This constellation of findings points to a failure of fat absorption rather than a simple motility disorder.\\\\n\\\\n[PATHOPHYSIOLOGY & CLASSIFICATION]\\\\nContent: Malabsorption can be broadly categorized into three defects: luminal digestion, mucosal absorption, or lymphatic transport. Luminal digestion issues, such as Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency (EPI), occur when enzymes (lipase, protease) are lacking, preventing the breakdown of macronutrients. Mucosal defects arise from damage to the small intestine lining (e.g., Celiac disease, Whipple\\'s disease), reducing the surface area for absorption.  Lymphatic obstruction (e.g., lymphangiectasia) specifically impairs the transport of absorbed fats and chylomicrons into the systemic circulation.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME]\\\\nContent: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS-D) is a functional disorder that is a common distractor. Like malabsorption, it presents with chronic diarrhea and abdominal bloating. However, a key distinction is the *absence* of alarm features in IBS: patients typically do not experience significant weight loss, nutritional deficiencies, or nocturnal diarrhea. Stools in IBS may be loose but are rarely steatorrheic (greasy/floating). Furthermore, IBS does not cause the vitamin deficiencies (e.g., night blindness from Vit A, osteomalacia from Vit D) seen in true malabsorption syndromes.\\\\n\\\\n[DIAGNOSTIC WORKUP]\\\\nContent: The gold standard for diagnosing fat malabsorption is the 72-hour fecal fat collection, though this is cumbersome. More commonly, a qualitative fecal fat stain (Sudan III stain) is used as a screen. To differentiate pancreatic causes from mucosal causes, a D-Xylose absorption test can be performed; normal D-Xylose absorption suggests the mucosa is intact (pointing towards pancreatic enzyme deficiency), whereas low absorption suggests mucosal damage (e.g., Celiac sprue). Specific breath tests can also identify carbohydrate malabsorption (e.g., Lactose hydrogen breath test) or Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO).\\\\n\\\\n[CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS]\\\\nContent: Symptoms extend beyond the GI tract due to systemic nutrient deficits.

There was no associated inguinal lymphadenopathy (buboes), which is a key differentiating feature from other genital ulcer diseases. A tissue crush preparation (Giemsa stain) showed intracytoplasmic inclusions within macrophages, known as *Donovan bodies*, confirming the diagnosis.\\\\n\\\\n[ETIOLOGY & TRANSMISSION]\\\\nContent: The causative agent is *Klebsiella granulomatis* (formerly *Calymmatobacterium granulomatis*), a gram-negative intracellular bacterium. Transmission is primarily sexual, though rare non-sexual transmission via direct contact can occur. The incubation period is prolonged, ranging from 1 to 12 weeks, sometimes up to a year.

However, the clinical presentation is distinct: Chancroid ulcers are classically *painful* (unlike the painless ulcers of Donovanosis) and have a \\\\\"dirty\\\\\" gray-yellow base with ragged, undermined edges.  Furthermore, Chancroid is strongly associated with painful, suppurative inguinal lymphadenitis (buboes) in 50% of cases, whereas true lymph node involvement is rare in Granuloma Inguinale (though \\\\\"pseudobuboes\\\\\" from subcutaneous granulation can occur).\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: LYMPHOGRANULOMA VENEREUM]\\\\nContent: Lymphogranuloma Venereum (LGV) is caused by invasive serovars (L1-L3) of *Chlamydia trachomatis*. The primary genital lesion is often a small, transient, painless papule or ulcer that heals quickly and is frequently missed. The hallmark of LGV is the secondary stage, characterized by massive, painful, tender inguinal and femoral lymphadenopathy (Groove Sign). This contrasts with Donovanosis, where the primary skin lesion is the dominant and persistent feature, and significant lymphadenopathy is absent.\\\\n\\\\n[COMPLICATIONS & TREATMENT]\\\\nContent: Without treatment, the ulcers of Granuloma Inguinale can spread locally to the inguinal folds, perineum, and anus, causing extensive tissue destruction, scarring, and lymphatic obstruction (pseudo-elephantiasis).

Unlike a splinter or wart, these lesions have rapidly enlarged over 2 weeks and are causing difficulty walking.\\\\n\\\\n[VECTOR BIOLOGY & LIFECYCLE]\\\\nContent: The causative agent is the female burrowing flea, *Tunga penetrans* (also known as chigoe flea, jigger, or nigua). Unlike common fleas that bite and leave, the impregnated female *Tunga* burrows head-first into the epidermis to feed on blood. She swells to 2000 times her original size while producing eggs, creating the characteristic white nodule.

However, CLM is caused by animal hookworm larvae (*Ancylostoma braziliense*) that migrate *through* the skin, creating a raised, red, serpentine (snake-like) track that moves slightly each day (\\\\\"creeping eruption\\\\\").  In contrast, Tungiasis lesions are static, nodular, and do not migrate. The pain in Tungiasis is often described as \\\\\"deep\\\\\" or foreign-body sensation, whereas CLM is primarily intensely pruritic.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: PLANTAR WARTS]\\\\nContent: Plantar warts (Verruca plantaris) can mimic the appearance of Tungiasis due to the presence of \\\\\"black dots.\\\\\" However, in warts, these dots represent thrombosed capillaries within a hyperkeratotic plaque caused by Human Papillomavirus (HPV).

Bites from sand flies typically result in Leishmaniasis, which presents as a painless ulcer with raised borders (cutaneous leishmaniasis) or systemic illness (visceral leishmaniasis).

He recently returned from a month-long trip to rural Mexico.  He also reports a dull, aching pain in his right upper quadrant (RUQ). Abdominal ultrasound revealed a solitary, hypoechoic lesion in the right lobe of the liver. Aspiration of the abscess yielded a thick, reddish-brown fluid resembling \\\\\"anchovy paste,\\\\\" which is pathognomonic for an Amebic Liver Abscess. Stool microscopy identified trophozoites of *Entamoeba histolytica* with ingested red blood cells (erythrophagocytosis).\\\\n\\\\n[PATHOGEN & TRANSMISSION]\\\\nContent: The causative agent, *Entamoeba histolytica*, is a protozoan parasite. Infection occurs via the fecal-oral route, typically by ingesting infective cysts in contaminated food or water.  Unlike non-invasive *Entamoeba dispar*, *E. histolytica* releases enzymes that destroy intestinal tissue, creating characteristic \\\\\"flask-shaped ulcers\\\\\" in the colon lining. The parasite can invade the bloodstream and travel to the liver, lungs, or brain. Risk factors include travel to tropical regions with poor sanitation, institutional living, and men who have sex with men (MSM).\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: BACILLARY DYSENTERY]\\\\nContent: Shigellosis (Bacillary Dysentery) is the primary differential for bloody diarrhea. While symptoms overlap, Shigellosis typically presents more acutely with higher fever and severe tenesmus (straining).  It is caused by *Shigella* bacteria, not a parasite. A key distinction is that *Shigella* infection rarely causes liver abscesses. Diagnosis is confirmed by stool culture yielding bacterial growth, and treatment typically involves Fluoroquinolones or Azithromycin, whereas Amebiasis requires Nitroimidazoles.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: GIARDIASIS]\\\\nContent: *Giardia duodenalis* is another common waterborne parasite (often called \\\\\"Beaver Fever\\\\\"). However, the clinical presentation is distinct: Giardiasis causes *non-bloody*, watery, foul-smelling, and greasy stools (steatorrhea) due to fat malabsorption.  It inhabits the small intestine (duodenum) rather than the colon and does not cause the bloody, mucoid stools or hepatic abscesses seen in invasive Amebiasis.\\\\n\\\\n[TREATMENT PROTOCOL]\\\\nContent: Treatment of invasive Amebiasis involves a two-step approach. First, a tissue-active agent like Metronidazole (Flagyl) or Tinidazole is used to kill the invasive trophozoites in the gut wall and liver. This must be followed by a luminal agent (paromomycin or iodoquinol) to eradicate the cysts remaining in the intestine and prevent the patient from becoming a chronic carrier.

He also complained of a recurrent, intensely itchy, red streak on his buttocks and lower back that \\\\\"moves rapidly\\\\\" (up to 10 cm per hour).  This rash, known as *larva currens* (racing larva), typically disappears within hours only to reappear elsewhere. His symptoms exacerbated recently after being prescribed high-dose prednisone for an unrelated asthma flare. Given his remote travel history and the pathognomonic rash, a diagnosis of Strongyloidiasis was suspected. Stool microscopy revealed rhabditiform larvae, confirming the reactivation of a dormant infection.\\\\n\\\\n[PATHOPHYSIOLOGY & AUTOINFECTION]\\\\nContent: The causative agent, *Strongyloides stercoralis*, is unique among soil-transmitted helminths because of its ability to replicate within the human host (autoinfection). Larvae hatch in the intestine and can immediately re-penetrate the bowel wall or perianal skin to re-enter the circulation, migrating to the lungs and back to the gut.  This cycle allows the infection to persist for decades after the initial exposure in a tropical region. While often asymptomatic, administration of corticosteroids or HTLV-1 coinfection can trigger \\\\\"Hyperinfection Syndrome,\\\\\" a massive, life-threatening dissemination of larvae to major organs (lungs, brain, liver).\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: CUTANEOUS LARVA MIGRANS]\\\\nContent: Cutaneous Larva Migrans (CLM) is the most common mimic but has distinct differences. CLM is caused by animal hookworms (*Ancylostoma braziliense*) acquired from walking on sandy beaches. The rash in CLM is a \\\\\"creeping eruption\\\\\" that moves very slowly (1-2 cm per *day*), whereas *larva currens* in Strongyloidiasis moves rapidly (5-10 cm per *hour*).  Additionally, CLM lesions are typically confined to the feet or areas exposed to sand and do not involve the chronic gastrointestinal symptoms seen in Strongyloidiasis.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: URTICARIA]\\\\nContent: Chronic urticaria (hives) can present with migratory, itchy red welts. However, urticarial wheals typically last less than 24 hours, are raised and edematous, and do not form the distinct linear or serpiginous (snake-like) tracks seen in *larva currens*. Urticaria is a hypersensitivity reaction and is not accompanied by eosinophilia or the specific epigastric tenderness associated with parasitic duodenitis.\\\\n\\\\n[DIAGNOSTIC CHALLENGES & TREATMENT]\\\\nContent: Diagnosis is often missed because stool ova and parasite (O&P) exams have low sensitivity (larvae are shed intermittently). Serology (IgG enzyme immunoassay) is the most sensitive screening tool for chronic cases. In the setting of hyperinfection, larvae may be found in sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. The treatment of choice is Ivermectin (200 µg/kg) for 1-2 days for uncomplicated cases. Albendazole is an alternative but is less effective.

Physical exam revealed macerated, white patches on the pressure points of the heels and forefoot, characterized by numerous tiny, shallow, \\\\\"punched-out\\\\\" depressions (1–2 mm pits). These pits coalesced in some areas to form crater-like erosions. The distinct odor is caused by sulfur compounds produced by bacteria such as *Kytococcus sedentarius* and *Dermatophilus congolensis* digesting the keratin of the stratum corneum.\\\\n\\\\n[PATHOGENESIS & RISK FACTORS]\\\\nContent: Pitted Keratolysis is a superficial bacterial infection, not fungal. The primary predisposing factor is hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) combined with occlusive footwear (boots, vinyl shoes) that prevents evaporation. This creates a warm, moist, alkaline environment where bacteria thrive. These bacteria secrete protease enzymes that destroy the horny layer of the skin (*stratum corneum*), creating the characteristic pits.

A key distinguishing feature is the presence of \\\\\"black dots\\\\\" (thrombosed capillaries) within the wart, which are absent in Pitted Keratolysis. Furthermore, warts are typically tender when squeezed laterally, while Pitted Keratolysis is generally not painful.\\\\n\\\\n[TREATMENT & MANAGEMENT]\\\\nContent: The mainstay of treatment is topical antibiotics to eliminate the bacteria (e.g., Clindamycin, Erythromycin, or Mupirocin) and addressing the underlying moisture. Patients are advised to wear moisture-wicking cotton socks, rotate footwear to allow drying, and use antiperspirants (e.g., aluminum chloride) to control hyperhidrosis.

However, distinct features help differentiate them: MS typically follows a *relapsing-remitting* course (episodes of worsening followed by recovery) and involves the brain and optic nerves (optic neuritis).

She reports that her symptoms seem to improve for a few days, only to return with severity (waxing and waning course). She has not traveled internationally but recalls eating a pesto pasta salad with fresh basil and cilantro at a catered wedding event last month.  She has lost 4 kg due to anorexia. Stool microscopy with modified acid-fast staining revealed variably stained, spherical oocysts (8–10 µm in diameter), which are twice the size of *Cryptosporidium*. Under UV fluorescence microscopy, the oocysts appeared bright blue, confirming the diagnosis of *Cyclospora cayetanensis*.\\\\n\\\\n[EPIDEMIOLOGY & TRANSMISSION]\\\\nContent: *Cyclospora cayetanensis* is a coccidian parasite endemic to tropical and subtropical regions (e.g., Peru, Guatemala, Nepal). In non-endemic areas like the US and Canada, outbreaks are frequently linked to imported fresh produce such as raspberries, basil, cilantro, and snow peas.  Unlike many other protozoa, *Cyclospora* is *not* immediately infectious in fresh stool; the oocysts require days to weeks in the environment to sporulate and become infective. Therefore, direct person-to-person transmission (fecal-oral) is virtually non-existent, a key distinction from *Cryptosporidium* or *Giardia*.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: CRYPTOSPORIDIOSIS]\\\\nContent: Cryptosporidiosis is the primary mimic, as it also causes prolonged watery diarrhea and is acid-fast positive. However, *Cryptosporidium hominis/parvum* oocysts are significantly smaller (4–6 µm) and do not autofluoresce. Epidemiologically, *Cryptosporidium* is highly resistant to chlorine and is often associated with recreational water outbreaks (swimming pools, water parks) or direct animal contact (petting zoos), whereas *Cyclospora* is almost exclusively foodborne or waterborne in origin.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: BACTERIAL GASTROENTERITIS]\\\\nContent: Typical bacterial food poisoning (e.g., *Salmonella*, *Campylobacter*) presents acutely within 6-48 hours of exposure and often resolves within a week. In contrast, the incubation period for Cyclosporiasis is longer (average 7 days), and without treatment, the illness can persist for weeks to months with a characteristic relapsing pattern.

A KOH preparation of the scale showed short hyphae and round yeast cells, a pattern described as \\\\\"spaghetti and meatballs,\\\\\" confirming the diagnosis.\\\\n\\\\n[PATHOPHYSIOLOGY & RISK FACTORS]\\\\nContent: Tinea Versicolor is a superficial fungal infection caused by the overgrowth of the yeast *Malassezia furfur* (part of the normal skin flora). The yeast thrives in warm, moist, and oily environments, which is why the condition is most common in young adults (active oil glands) and those living in tropical climates or who sweat excessively (hyperhidrosis).  The yeast produces azelaic acid, which inhibits melanin production, leading to the characteristic hypopigmented patches that contrast with tanned skin.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: VITILIGO]\\\\nContent: Vitiligo is the most common mimic of the hypopigmented variety of Tinea Versicolor. However, Vitiligo presents with *complete* depigmentation (chalk-white macules) rather than just lighter skin.  Crucially, Vitiligo lesions are smooth and lack the fine scale seen in Tinea Versicolor. Vitiligo is an autoimmune destruction of melanocytes, often affecting the face and hands, whereas Tinea Versicolor typically favors the sebaceous-rich areas of the trunk (back/chest) and is caused by a fungus.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: PITYRIASIS ROSEA]\\\\nContent: Pityriasis Rosea is another papulosquamous eruption that affects the trunk.

Unlike Tinea Versicolor, Pityriasis Rosea is believed to be viral in origin (HHV-6/7), is self-limiting (resolving in 6-8 weeks), and potassium hydroxide (KOH) testing is negative for fungal elements.\\\\n\\\\n[TREATMENT & MANAGEMENT]\\\\nContent: Treatment focuses on reducing the yeast population. First-line therapy includes topical antifungals such as Selenium Sulfide 2.5% lotion or shampoo (Selsun Blue), Ketoconazole cream, or Zinc Pyrithione soap. These should be applied to the affected areas for several minutes before rinsing. For widespread or resistant cases, oral antifungals like Fluconazole or Itraconazole may be prescribed.

A Tzanck smear or viral PCR can confirm HSV if the diagnosis is unclear.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: CONTACT DERMATITIS]\\\\nContent: Allergic Contact Dermatitis (e.g., Poison Ivy) can cause weeping vesicles and crusting.

Furthermore, contact dermatitis is intensely pruritic but does not typically produce the thick, golden, \\\\\"stuck-on\\\\\" crusts seen in bacterial impetigo, and it is not contagious person-to-person.\\\\n\\\\n[TREATMENT & COMPLICATIONS]\\\\nContent: Localized impetigo is treated with topical antibiotics such as Mupirocin (Bactroban) or Retapamulin ointment applied three times daily. For widespread infection or ecthyma, oral antibiotics (e.g., Cephalexin or Dicloxacillin) are required to cover both Staph and Strep.

The patient is in distress but has no systemic symptoms like difficulty breathing, chest pain, or muscle cramps (which would raise concern for Irukandji syndrome or Box Jellyfish).\\\\n\\\\n[PATHOPHYSIOLOGY & NEMATOCYSTS]\\\\nContent: Jellyfish have tentacles armed with thousands of microscopic stinging cells called *nematocysts*. When a tentacle brushes against skin, these cells trigger a spring-loaded mechanism, firing barbed threads (tubules) that inject venom into the victim.  This process occurs in a fraction of a second and can happen even if the tentacle is detached from the jellyfish or if the jellyfish is dead on the beach. Factors influencing severity include the species (Box Jellyfish being the most deadly), patient age, and total surface area stung.\\\\n\\\\n[MANAGEMENT: DO\\'S & DON\\'TS]\\\\nContent: Immediate first aid is crucial and often counter-intuitive. \\\\n1. **Rinse with Seawater:** Use ocean water to wash away tentacles. *Never* use freshwater (bottled/tap water), as the change in osmotic pressure can cause unfired nematocysts to discharge, worsening the sting.\\\\n2. **Vinegar Application:** For most species (including Box Jellyfish and Sea Nettles), pouring household vinegar on the sting stops the nematocysts from firing. However, vinegar should *not* be used for Portuguese Man-of-War stings, as it can stimulate venom release.\\\\n3. **Heat vs. Cold:** Immersion in hot water (40-45°C) or hot packs is effective for pain relief as heat degrades the venom proteins. Ice packs can also be used if heat is unavailable.\\\\n4. **Myth Buster:** Do *not* urinate on the sting.

He noted that the rash has a raised, ring-like border on the dorsal surface, while the palm shows diffuse thickening (hyperkeratosis) and accentuation of the skin lines.  Interestingly, his left hand is completely spared. He also reports chronic peeling and itching between the toes of *both* feet (Tinea Pedis). This clinical presentation of bilateral foot infection paired with unilateral hand involvement is classically known as \\\\\"Two Feet-One Hand Syndrome.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n[ETIOLOGY & TRANSMISSION]\\\\nContent: Tinea Manuum is a dermatophyte infection caused by fungi such as *Trichophyton rubrum*, *Trichophyton mentagrophytes*, or *Epidermophyton floccosum*. These fungi thrive in warm, humid environments (locker rooms, showers) and feed on keratin in the outer skin layer. Transmission occurs via direct contact with infected people, animals (zoophilic species), or soil, but often involves autoinoculation—scratching infected feet (Tinea Pedis) with the dominant hand, leading to infection of that hand while the other remains clear.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: HAND ECZEMA]\\\\nContent: Hand Eczema (Dermatitis) is the most common mimic. However, eczema is typically *bilateral* (affecting both hands) and presents with weeping vesicles, intense itching, and no clear central clearing.

Treatment involves topical antifungals (e.g., Clotrimazole, Terbinafine) for mild cases, applied for 4–6 weeks. However, because the palmar skin is thick (hyperkeratotic), topical agents may fail to penetrate.

It typically triggers an immediate, reproducible reaction (hives, anaphylaxis) upon exposure to even tiny amounts of the allergen. In contrast, Histamine Intolerance is dose-dependent (cumulative) and can vary based on other factors like stress or alcohol intake.

The most common species affecting humans are *Clonorchis sinensis* (Chinese liver fluke) and *Opisthorchis viverrini* (Southeast Asian liver fluke). Infection is acquired by ingesting encysted larvae (metacercariae) in raw or undercooked freshwater fish.  Once ingested, the larvae excyst in the duodenum and migrate up the Ampulla of Vater into the bile ducts, where they mature into adults. Chronic inflammation from long-standing infection (often lasting decades) causes periductal fibrosis and is a major risk factor for **Cholangiocarcinoma** (bile duct cancer).\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: FASCIOLIASIS]\\\\nContent: *Fasciola hepatica* (Sheep Liver Fluke) is another important fluke but has a different transmission route. Unlike *Clonorchis*, which comes from fish, *Fasciola* is acquired by eating contaminated aquatic plants like **watercress**.  Clinically, the acute phase of Fascioliasis is often more severe, characterized by high fever, intense RUQ pain, and marked eosinophilia as the immature worms migrate *through* the liver parenchyma (hepatic phase) before settling in the ducts. Treatment also differs: *Fasciola* responds to Triclabendazole, whereas *Clonorchis* requires Praziquantel.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: CHOLEDOCHOLITHIASIS]\\\\nContent: Common bile duct stones (choledocholithiasis) frequently present with RUQ pain, jaundice, and dilated ducts. However, stones typically cause acute, colicky pain and may be visible as echogenic foci with shadowing on ultrasound. In Liver Fluke infection, the ductal dilation is often diffuse or peripheral, and the \\\\\"obstruction\\\\\" is caused by the flukes themselves or strictures, often without the acute severe pain of a passing stone unless cholangitis supervenes.\\\\n\\\\n[MANAGEMENT]\\\\nContent: The treatment of choice for *Clonorchis* and *Opisthorchis* infections is Praziquantel (25 mg/kg 3 times a day for 2 days). This paralyzes the worms, allowing them to be flushed out of the biliary system. Albendazole is an alternative. For *Fasciola* species, Triclabendazole is the only effective agent.

She has no diarrhea, weight loss, or abdominal pain. Her mother reports that several children at her daycare have had \\\\\"worms.\\\\\"  A \\\\\"Scotch Tape Test\\\\\" was performed by pressing clear adhesive tape against the perianal skin in the morning; microscopy revealed characteristic flattened, asymmetrical eggs, confirming Enterobiasis. This presentation is distinct from protozoan infections like Giardia, which primarily cause diarrhea rather than isolated pruritus.\\\\n\\\\n[CLASSIFICATION: HELMINTHS VS PROTOZOA]\\\\nContent: Intestinal parasites are broadly categorized into two groups: \\\\n1. **Helminths (Worms):** Multicellular organisms visible to the naked eye. This group includes Roundworms (Nematodes) like *Pinworms*, *Ascaris*, and *Hookworms*, as well as Flatworms like *Tapeworms* (Cestodes) and *Flukes*. They typically spread via soil contaminated with feces or ingestion of undercooked meat/fish.\\\\n2. **Protozoa:** Single-celled microscopic organisms. Common examples include *Giardia*, *Cryptosporidium*, and *Entamoeba histolytica*. These are often waterborne or foodborne and are more likely to cause explosive diarrhea and dehydration compared to the often asymptomatic or nutritional-deficiency presentation of worms.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: GIARDIASIS]\\\\nContent: *Giardia duodenalis* is the most common protozoan parasite in the US. Unlike Pinworms (which cause itching), Giardiasis presents with foul-smelling, greasy diarrhea (steatorrhea), bloating, and gas.  It is typically acquired from contaminated water sources (lakes, streams) and does not cause the nocturnal anal pruritus seen in Enterobiasis. Diagnosis requires a Stool Ova & Parasite (O&P) exam or antigen testing, as the tape test is useless for protozoa.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: TAPEWORM]\\\\nContent: Tapeworms (*Taenia* species) are segmented flatworms acquired from undercooked beef or pork. Patients are often asymptomatic but may pass visible white, rice-like segments (proglottids) in their stool, which can be alarming.  Unlike the microscopic eggs of pinworms found on perianal skin, tapeworm diagnosis relies on identifying these segments or eggs in the feces. Heavy infestations can lead to weight loss and malnutrition.\\\\n\\\\n[TREATMENT & PREVENTION]\\\\nContent: Treatment depends on the organism. For Pinworms, a single dose of Pyrantel Pamoate or Albendazole is given, repeated in 2 weeks to kill newly hatched eggs. For Protozoa like Giardia, Metronidazole is the standard. Prevention centers on hygiene: washing hands to remove microscopic eggs (which can survive on surfaces/linens), wearing shoes to prevent Hookworm entry through skin, and drinking only clean/bottled water in high-risk areas.\"\\n}',\n",

He also reported recurrent, painful, itchy swellings on his wrists and forearms that appear spontaneously and resolve after a few days (Calabar swellings). He recalls being bitten frequently by large, day-biting flies during his trip. A blood smear taken at noon (to match the parasite\\'s diurnal periodicity) revealed sheathed microfilariae, confirming *Loa loa* infection.\\\\n\\\\n[VECTOR & EPIDEMIOLOGY]\\\\nContent: The causative agent is the nematode *Loa loa*, transmitted by the bite of the *Chrysops* fly (Deer fly or Mango fly). These flies breed in the high-canopy rainforests of West and Central Africa.  Unlike mosquitoes which are often nocturnal, *Chrysops* flies are diurnal (day-biting). The adult worms migrate through the subcutaneous tissues of humans, occasionally crossing the subconjunctival space of the eye, which is the most dramatic clinical sign. They do not cause blindness (unlike Onchocerciasis) but cause significant irritation and psychological distress.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: ONCHOCERCIASIS]\\\\nContent: Onchocerciasis (River Blindness) is another filarial disease found in similar African regions. However, it is transmitted by *Simulium* blackflies, not deer flies. Clinically, Onchocerciasis causes severe dermatitis (\\\\\"leopard skin\\\\\"), subcutaneous nodules (onchocercomas), and keratitis that leads to permanent *blindness*.  In contrast, *Loa loa* does not typically damage the vision permanently. Furthermore, *Onchocerca volvulus* microfilariae are found in skin snips, whereas *Loa loa* microfilariae are found in the blood.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: MANSONELLOSIS]\\\\nContent: *Mansonella perstans* is often co-endemic in Central Africa. It is transmitted by midges (*Culicoides*). Infections are often asymptomatic or cause mild itching and angioedema.  Crucially, *Mansonella* microfilariae are smaller and lack a sheath, distinguishing them from the larger, sheathed *Loa loa* on a blood smear. Treatment also differs, as *Mansonella* is often resistant to standard filaricides.\\\\n\\\\n[TREATMENT & PRECAUTIONS]\\\\nContent: The treatment of choice is Diethylcarbamazine (DEC), which kills both adult worms and microfilariae. However, in patients with a very high microfilarial load (>8,000/mL), rapid killing of the parasites can cause a fatal encephalopathy. Therefore, patients must be screened first. If the load is high, Albendazole or apheresis is used to lower the count before starting DEC.

Physical exam reveals multiple tense, clear fluid-filled bullae on an erythematous/urticarial base. Crucially, applying lateral pressure to the skin next to a blister does *not* cause the skin to slough off (Negative Nikolsky Sign).\\\\n\\\\n[EPIDEMIOLOGY & PATHOPHYSIOLOGY]\\\\nContent: Bullous Pemphigoid is a rare autoimmune blistering disease that primarily affects the elderly (typically over 60, with incidence rising sharply after 80). It occurs when the immune system attacks the basement membrane zone (the layer between the epidermis and dermis), specifically targeting hemidesmosome proteins.  Triggers can include certain medications (like gliptins for diabetes), UV light, or radiation. It is associated with neurological conditions such as dementia, Parkinson\\'s disease, and stroke.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: PEMPHIGUS VULGARIS]\\\\nContent: Pemphigus Vulgaris is the primary differential but has distinct features. It affects a younger demographic (40s-60s) and almost always starts with painful *oral* erosions (mucous membrane involvement), which are present in only about 33% of Bullous Pemphigoid cases.  The blisters in Pemphigus are flaccid (soft) and rupture very easily due to the superficial level of separation (intra-epidermal). Consequently, patients often present with erosions rather than intact blisters, and they exhibit a *Positive* Nikolsky Sign (skin shears off with pressure).\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: ECZEMA/HIVES]\\\\nContent: In the early \\\\\"pre-bullous\\\\\" phase, Bullous Pemphigoid often presents as itchy, red welts that resemble hives (urticaria) or eczema. This can lead to misdiagnosis before the characteristic blisters appear. However, unlike standard hives which are transient (lasting <24 hours), the urticarial plaques of Bullous Pemphigoid are fixed and persist for days to weeks before blistering. Eczema typically lacks the distinct tense bullae found in established pemphigoid.\\\\n\\\\n[TREATMENT & PROGNOSIS]\\\\nContent: The condition is generally self-limiting but may last up to 5 years. Treatment focuses on suppressing the immune response. For mild cases, potent topical corticosteroids are the first line. Moderate-to-severe cases require oral corticosteroids (Prednisone) often combined with steroid-sparing agents like Dapsone, Methotrexate, or Azathioprine. Tetracycline/Doxycycline is an alternative for those who cannot tolerate steroids.

His history of uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes is a significant contributing factor, creating a bidirectional relationship where the gum disease worsens his blood sugar control.\\\\n\\\\n[PATHOPHYSIOLOGY]\\\\nContent: Periodontitis is a chronic bacterial infection that destroys the supporting structures of the teeth (periodontium). It begins as Gingivitis, where plaque bacteria cause superficial inflammation. If untreated, the plaque calcifies into tartar (calculus), which pushes the gums away from the teeth, forming \\\\\"pockets.\\\\\"  The body\\'s immune response to these bacteria releases enzymes that break down the periodontal ligament and alveolar bone.

Both present with red, bleeding gums. However, the key distinction is **bone loss**. In Gingivitis, the inflammation is confined to the soft tissue, and the teeth remain firmly anchored with no radiographic evidence of bone destruction.

While Periodontitis is often a dull, chronic ache or painless, an abscess causes sharp, intense pain and may be accompanied by fever and lymphadenopathy.\\\\n\\\\n[TREATMENT & MANAGEMENT]\\\\nContent: Standard brushing and flossing are insufficient once pockets form because they cannot reach deep enough. The gold standard initial treatment is **Scaling and Root Planing (SRP)**, often called a \\\\\"deep cleaning.\\\\\" This involves mechanically removing the subgingival tartar and smoothing the root surfaces to allow the gums to reattach.

She reports the pain is \\\\\"mechanical\\\\\" in nature: it worsens with activity (like climbing stairs or walking long distances) and improves with rest.  She describes a \\\\\"gelling phenomenon\\\\\" where her joints feel stiff after sitting for long periods, but this stiffness resolves within 15–20 minutes of moving around (Morning Stiffness < 30 mins). Physical exam reveals palpable **crepitus** (grating sensation) upon knee flexion/extension and bony enlargement, but no significant warmth or erythema. Her BMI is 32, which is a significant modifiable risk factor.\\\\n\\\\n[PATHOPHYSIOLOGY]\\\\nContent: Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis, characterized by the progressive breakdown of articular cartilage.  Unlike the synovial inflammation seen in autoimmune forms, OA is primarily a \\\\\"wear and tear\\\\\" process where the shock-absorbing cartilage wears away, eventually leading to bone-on-bone friction. This stimulates the formation of new bone at the joint margins, known as **osteophytes** (bone spurs), which contribute to the limited range of motion and pain.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS]\\\\nContent: Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is the primary differential to rule out. RA is an autoimmune disease that causes systemic inflammation. Crucially, RA pain is often worse in the morning with stiffness lasting **longer than 1 hour**, whereas OA stiffness typically resolves in <30 minutes. RA also tends to affect smaller joints (MCPs, PIPs) symmetrically and presents with soft, spongy swelling (synovitis) and warmth, rather than the hard, bony enlargement (Heberden\\'s and Bouchard\\'s nodes) seen in OA.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: GOUT]\\\\nContent: Gout can also cause joint pain but typically presents as an acute, monoarticular flare (e.g., sudden, intense pain in the big toe or knee) with marked redness and heat due to urate crystal deposition. OA is a chronic, slowly progressive condition without the acute inflammatory signs of a gout flare. Aspiration of the joint fluid in OA would show clear, yellow fluid with a low white blood cell count, unlike the cloudy, crystal-laden fluid of gout.\\\\n\\\\n[MANAGEMENT]\\\\nContent: Management focuses on symptom relief and function preservation. Initial treatment is conservative: **Weight loss** and low-impact exercise (swimming, cycling) are the most effective interventions to reduce load on weight-bearing joints. Pharmacologic therapy includes Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or NSAIDs (Ibuprofen) for pain, and topical agents (Voltaren gel). Corticosteroid injections can provide temporary relief. For end-stage disease with severe functional limitation, Total Joint Arthroplasty (knee replacement) is the definitive treatment.\"\\n}',\n",

He has a history of Type 2 Diabetes and frequent swimming in public pools. He also noted itchy, peeling skin between his toes, suggestive of concurrent Tinea Pedis (Athlete\\'s Foot). The patient attempted to treat the nails with over-the-counter creams for months with no improvement, which is typical as topicals rarely penetrate the nail plate effectively.\\\\n\\\\n[PATHOPHYSIOLOGY]\\\\nContent: Mycotic nails are caused by fungal organisms, primarily **dermatophytes** (responsible for 80-90% of cases), though yeasts (Candida) and molds can also be culprits. The fungus invades the keratin of the nail unit, often starting at the distal edge and spreading proximally (Distal Subungual Onychomycosis).  The infection thrives in warm, moist environments (sweaty socks, locker rooms) and feeds on the keratin protein, leading to the characteristic subungual hyperkeratosis (thickening) and debris accumulation.

Acute radiation proctitis occurs during treatment, while chronic radiation proctitis can present months or years later with bleeding due to telangiectasias (fragile blood vessels).\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: HEMORRHOIDS]\\\\nContent: Internal Hemorrhoids are the most frequent cause of bright red rectal bleeding. However, hemorrhoidal bleeding is typically painless and occurs *at the end* of a bowel movement (dripping into the toilet).  Unlike proctitis, hemorrhoids do not cause the intense inflammation, tenesmus, or purulent/mucus discharge seen in proctitis. Anoscopy can visualize the enlarged venous cushions of hemorrhoids, whereas proctitis shows a diffuse, red, friable mucosal surface.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: ANAL FISSURE]\\\\nContent: An Anal Fissure is a tear in the lining of the anal canal.

The clinical presentation depends entirely on the host\\'s immune status:\\\\n1.  **Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA):** A hypersensitivity reaction in patients with asthma or Cystic Fibrosis, leading to airway inflammation, bronchiectasis, and mucus plugging.\\\\n2.  **Aspergilloma:** A \\\\\"fungus ball\\\\\" that grows in a pre-existing lung cavity (e.g., from old TB or sarcoidosis). It is often asymptomatic but can cause life-threatening hemoptysis (coughing up blood).\\\\n3.  **Invasive Aspergillosis:** A severe, often fatal infection where the fungus invades blood vessels and spreads to other organs (brain, kidneys). This occurs almost exclusively in severely immunocompromised patients (e.g., bone marrow transplant recipients, prolonged neutropenia).\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: INVASIVE ASPERGILLOSIS]\\\\nContent: Invasive Aspergillosis is the most critical differential but affects a different demographic. It presents with high fever, pleuritic chest pain, and severe dyspnea in a patient with profound neutropenia or on high-dose immunosuppression.  A key radiographic feature is the \\\\\"halo sign\\\\\" (nodule with ground-glass opacity) on CT, which is absent in ABPA. Unlike ABPA, invasive disease requires aggressive IV antifungal therapy (e.g., Voriconazole) and has a high mortality rate.\\\\n\\\\n[DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: CHRONIC PULMONARY ASPERGILLOSIS]\\\\nContent: Chronic Pulmonary Aspergillosis (CPA) affects patients with underlying lung damage (COPD, prior TB) but who are not profoundly immunocompromised. It causes progressive cavitation, weight loss, and fatigue over months. While ABPA is an allergic reaction, CPA is a slowly progressive destructive infection. An Aspergilloma is a specific form of CPA where a fungal ball forms within a cavity.\\\\n\\\\n[TREATMENT & MANAGEMENT]\\\\nContent: Treatment varies by type. \\\\n* **ABPA:** The mainstay is **oral corticosteroids** (e.g., Prednisone) to reduce the allergic inflammation and prevent permanent lung damage (fibrosis/bronchiectasis). Antifungals like Itraconazole may be added to reduce the fungal burden and allow for steroid tapering.\\\\n* **Aspergilloma:** Often requires no treatment unless symptomatic (hemoptysis), in which case surgical resection or bronchial artery embolization is performed.\\\\n* **Invasive:** Requires urgent treatment with **Voriconazole** (first-line), Isavuconazole, or Amphotericin B.\"\\n}',\n",

VERIFY: Confirm the diagnostic difficulty (often takes years/multiple biopsies due to resemblance to benign conditions) and the specific cell type (CD4+ T-lymphocytes).\\n\\nThinking: Step 1) NORMALIZE (Layperson → Clinical):\\n- \"Rash that won\\'t go away with eczema cream\" = Refractory dermatosis.\\n- \"Skin looks like cigarette paper\" = Atrophy/Poikiloderma.\\n- \"Lumps appearing on skin\" = Tumor stage.\\n- \"Red man syndrome\" = Sezary Syndrome (Erythroderma).\\n\\nStep 2) IDENTIFY KEY FINDINGS:\\n- Pathology: Malignant T-cells migrate to the skin (Epidermotropism).\\n- Name Origin: \"Mycosis\" implies fungus (looks like mushroom tumors in late stage), but it is *not* a fungal infection.\\n- Progression: Indolent (slow-growing). Patients often have \"eczema\" for 10+ years before diagnosis.\\n\\nStep 3) PATTERN MATCHING:\\n✓ MATCHES Mycosis Fungoides:\\n   - Location: \"Bathing suit\" distribution (hips, buttocks, breasts) - sun-protected areas (Fits).\\n   - History: Misdiagnosed as psoriasis/eczema for years (Fits).\\n   - Lesions: Patches → Plaques → Tumors (Fits).\\n✗ RULES OUT Eczema: Eczema typically responds to steroids and involves flexural areas (elbows/knees), whereas MF prefers the trunk/buttocks and persists despite treatment.\\n✗ RULES OUT Tinea Corporis (Ringworm): Ringworm resolves with antifungals; MF does not.\\n\\nStep 4) VERIFY AGAINST REFERENCES:\\n- Reference: \"Type of Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL).\"\\n- Reference: \"Three stages: Patch, Plaque, Tumor.\"\\n- Reference: \"Often misdiagnosed as eczema or psoriasis.\"\\n- Reference: \"Treatment involves phototherapy (light) or skin-directed chemo.\"\\n\\nConclusion: The patient\\'s presentation of a **chronic, steroid-resistant rash** in a **\"bathing suit\" distribution**, progressing to **plaques or tumors**, is clinically diagnostic for **Mycosis Fungoides (CTCL)**.'}]"

The diagnosis was strongly supported by the patient's history of a WHO category III stray dog bite in a rabies-endemic country, the rapidly progressive febrile quadriparesis, the development of autonomic instability, and the critical omission of rabies immunoglobulin during post-exposure prophylaxis. The clinical course and confirmatory laboratory test ruled out other neurological conditions considered in the differential.\n",

The onset of symptoms occurred about one month after a stray dog bite. After admission, he developed autonomic instability, evidenced by increased perspiration and significant variability in heart rate and blood pressure.

      "[CLINICAL FEATURES]\n",
      "Content: Chikungunya is an acute infection of abrupt onset, heralded by fever and severe arthralgia, and followed by other constitutional symptoms and rash lasting for a period of 1-7 days. The incubation period is usually 2-3 days, with a range of 1-12 days. Fever rises abruptly, often reaching 39-40°C accompanied by intermittent shaking chills. This acute phase lasts 2-3 days. The temperature may remit for 1-2 days after a gap of 4-10 days, resulting in a 'saddle back' fever curve that is characteristic of arthropod-borne virus infections.\n",
      "The arthralgias are polyarticular, migratory and predominantly affect the small joints of the hands, wrists, ankles and feet (Fig. 32.2.2) with lesser involvement of larger joints. During the acute phase, patients complain bitterly of pain when asked to move. They characteristically lie still in the attitude of flexion. Pain on movement is worse in the morning, improved by mild exercise and exacerbated by strenuous exercise. Swelling may occur but fluid accumulation is uncommon. Patients with milder articular manifestation are usually symptom-free within a few weeks, but more severe cases require months to resolve entirely [1, 3]. A study indicated that over 12% of patients develop chronic joint symptoms. Generalized myalgias, as well as back and shoulder pain is common [4].\n",
      "Cutaneous  manifestations  are  typical  with  many  patients.  Initially, many present with facial and trunk flushing. This is usually followed by a maculopapular rash. The trunk and limbs are commonly involved (Fig. 32.2.3), but the face, palms and soles may also show lesions. The rash may simply fade or desquamate. Petechiae may occur alone or in association with the rash.\n",
      "During the acute phase, most patients will have headache, but it is not  usually  severe.  Photophobia  and  retro-orbital  pain  may  also\n",

      "Disease: Mayaro fever\n",
      "Diagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was Mayaro fever, caused by Mayaro virus (MAYV). This was confirmed by serological testing showing a positive Mayaro IgM-IFA (1280 on 29 August, 40 on 12 September) and IgG-IFA (2560 on both dates) with a confirmatory plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) that rose from 40 to 160. The diagnosis aligns with the patient's travel history to the Amazon Basin, the preceding dengue-like febrile illness, and the characteristic prolonged symmetrical polyarthralgias primarily affecting small peripheral joints, while other common travel-related viral and bacterial causes were ruled out by serology.\n",
      "Vitals: No specific vital signs were reported other than the occurrence of an acute febrile illness with chills.\n",
      "Content: During the second week of a 3.5-week trip to the Amazon Basin of northern Peru, the patient developed an acute febrile illness with chills, malaise, frontal headache, generalized myalgia, and a transient, non-pruritic maculopapular rash. The rash began on the forearms about 1 week after fever onset, spread to the trunk, neck, and face, and faded after 3 days. Slowly progressive, debilitating polyarthralgias affecting peripheral joints, with transient joint swelling, also developed. Painful cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy lasted for about 1 week. Fever and other acute symptoms subsided within 1 week, but polyarthralgias persisted, showing a symmetrical pattern mainly affecting the small joints of the hands and feet, wrists, ankles, and knees. Upon return to Switzerland a few weeks later, the patient reported stiffness of the affected joints, mainly in the morning and after immobility, and the joint pains did not improve for two more months.\n",
      "---\n",
      "[ARBOVIRUS]\n",
      "Content: Dengue is the most prevalent arbovirus in travelers. Although widespread, it is a common cause of fever only in those returning from Asia, the Caribbean and South America [15]. Most travelers present with  a  febrile  illness  associated  with  headache,  retro-orbital  pain, myalgia, arthralgia (especially back pain) and rash [15]. The rash is initially erythrodermic, and becomes petechial with disease progression (Fig. 143.3). Hepatitis, myocarditis, encephalitis and neuropathy can  occur.  Bleeding  gums,  epistaxis  and  gastrointestinal  bleeding occur but are not necessarily indicative of dengue hemorrhagic fever, which like dengue shock syndrome is rare in travelers. Chikungunya is increasingly reported in returning travelers from the islands of the Indian Ocean, South and Southeast Asia [16]. The clinical presentation  is  similar  to  classic  dengue  fever;  however,  arthralgia  is  more prominent.  In  the  majority  of  cases,  the  arthralgia  settles;  5-30% develop chronic arthropathy with pain, stiffness and swelling lasting months to years [17,18].\n",

      "Diagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is presumed spinal tuberculosis (Pott's disease). This is based on the chronic, progressive spastic paraparesis with a thoracic sensory level in a patient from a TB-endemic region who is also HIV-positive. The diagnosis is strongly supported by the spinal radiograph showing collapse of the T11 vertebral body and a paravertebral soft tissue mass, which are characteristic findings. Schistosomiasis was ruled out with negative stool and urine tests, and the insidious onset made acute transverse myelitis less likely.\n",
      "Vitals: On a visit three months after symptom onset, his temperature was slightly elevated at 37.5 °C (99.5 °F). Upon admission to the tertiary hospital, he was afebrile with normal vital signs.\n",
      "Content: The illness began one year prior with back pain. Over the following weeks, he developed difficulty walking and a 'pins and needles' sensation in his legs. Three months after onset, he presented to a health centre with a temperature of 37.5 °C and was given antimalarials and praziquantel. He also consulted a traditional healer. His condition progressively deteriorated over the next six months, eventually leaving him bedridden. The patient denies constitutional symptoms such as fever, night sweats, weight loss, or chronic cough. He has no haematuria or diarrhoea and is continent for stool and urine.\n"

       "    'content': \"PATIENT QUESTION:\\nI’ve had a fever that keeps getting higher every day, and now my stomach hurts and I feel extremely tired. I also noticed I'm \\nhaving constipation sometimes and then diarrhea the next day. Is this something serious or just a normal infection?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[MILD ILLNESS]\\nContent: Enteric fever is usually insidious. Fever may gradually increase over the first week of illness. Headache, anorexia, malaise, and other nonspecific,  flu-like  symptoms  are  common  and  may  precede  fever. Abdominal complaints  including  diarrhea,  constipation,  and  nonlocalizing abdominal pain each occur in less than a third of cases, but may raise clinical suspicion [16].\\nPhysical findings are also nonspecific. Relative bradycardia, or pulsetemperature dissociation, is considered a classic sign of enteric fever, but there is no widely accepted definition of relative bradycardia and little evidence that it is a useful predictor [17]. Rose spots are small, blanching pink macular lesions, typically 2-4 mm, that usually occur on the chest, abdomen and/or back during the second week of illness, but are infrequently observed. A white, yellow or brown coating of the tongue that spares the tongue's edges is common. Mild abdominal tenderness may be present. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, if present, are usually modest.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Intestinal capillariasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is intestinal capillariasis caused by the nematode Capillaria philippinensis. The diagnosis was established based on the patient's clinical presentation of severe chronic diarrhoea, profound malabsorption with weight loss and oedema, and electrolyte abnormalities. Definitive confirmation was made by the identification of characteristic peanut-shaped ova on stool microscopy. The patient's residence in an endemic region and her positive clinical response to albendazole therapy further substantiated the diagnosis.\\nVitals: On presentation, the patient was afebrile, with a heart rate of 100 bpm and blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg.\\nContent: Symptoms began two months prior with stomach rumbles and colicky abdominal pain, which later progressed to anorexia and vomiting. The patient developed voluminous diarrhoea, occurring five to ten times in 24 hours, both during the day and at night, and unrelated to meals. She had been treated with various antibiotics, including metronidazole, and antidiarrhoeal drugs without any improvement. Over the last month, she developed lower limb swelling and severe prostration.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Marburg virus disease\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is Marburg virus disease (MVD), a viral haemorrhagic fever. The diagnosis was strongly suspected based on the clinical presentation of a severe febrile illness with shock and conjunctivitis, and the epidemiological link to her husband who died of a similar illness after working in a mine. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by a positive Marburg virus PCR result. A co-infection with Plasmodium falciparum was also diagnosed but was considered less likely to be the cause of her severe presentation given the low parasitaemia and high local prevalence.\\nVitals: On presentation, her blood pressure was 85/65 mmHg, pulse rate was 105 bpm, and temperature was 38 °C (100.4 °F).\\nContent: The illness began 5 days prior with fever, a sore throat, and generalized aching. She subsequently developed abdominal pain and diarrhoea. Her condition has progressively worsened, leading to severe weakness to the point that she requires assistance to stand.\\n---\\n[ABDOMINAL PAIN]\\nContent: Enteric fever, amebic liver abscess, viral hepatitis, and, rarely, leaking or secondarily infected hydatid cysts may all cause fever and abdominal pain.\\n---\\n[SEVERE DEHYDRATION ( ≥ 10% VOLUME LOSS)]\\nContent: - Decreased consciousness\\n- Hypotension\\n- Deep respirations with an increase in respiratory rate\\n- Cool extremities\\n- Peripheral cyanosis\\nelicited  concern the  assessment of hydration (Box 3.2); the patient should be weighed at first presentation, as weight gain or loss can be a valuable guide to the effectiveness of rehydration.\\nThe rapid onset of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea after food consumption is most often due to the ingestion of a preformed toxin produced by Staphylococcus aureus , Bacillus cereus or Clostridium perfringens .\\nLarge-volume watery diarrhea indicates a small bowel etiology, e.g. due  to V.  cholerae ,  enterotoxigenic E.  coli and  rotavirus  infections. Toxin-induced  secretory  diarrhea  continues  independent  of  food intake. Malabsorption of carbohydrate in the small intestine leads to fermentation of unabsorbed substrates by colonic bacteria; this may cause bloating, the passage of much rectal gas and frothy stools, which are all characteristic of giardiasis. Cryptosporidiosis can involve both small and large bowel, causing short-lived and self-limiting diarrhea; however, the infection can be prolonged in patients with impaired immune responses. Cyclospora cayetanensis can also cause  acute and more chronic diarrhea with abnormalities of intestinal absorption.\\nFrequent  bowel  movements  with  small  volumes  of  stool  and  the passage  of  blood  and  mucus  suggest  colonic  infection.  Causes  of bloody diarrhea (dysentery) include invasive bacteria such as Campylobacter spp., enterohemorrhagic E. coli , and Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia spp.; nonbacterial causes include Entamoeba histolytica (amebic dysentery) and Balantidium coli , which is spread by close contact with pigs. Colicky abdominal pain is common in many gut infections and is especially severe in campylobacteriosis and yersiniosis, mimicking acute appendicitis. Fever, chills and generalized myalgia are usually associated with infection by invasive organisms; these patients appear ill and have generalized abdominal tenderness.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

Some people also get a rash, loss of appetite, or a swollen belly as the illness progresses. Typhoid is caused by the \\nbacteria Salmonella enterica serotype typhi, which spreads through contaminated water, ice, uncooked foods like raw fruits without a peel, and \\nfood handled by someone who didn’t wash their hands after using the bathroom. These symptoms can come from other infections too, so a \\nmedical test is needed to confirm. If the fever or stomach pain increases, seeking medical care is important.'}]},\n",

I recently traveled to a tropical area. Could this be something serious?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[INTRODUCTION]\\nContent: Up to 70% of travelers to developing countries report health problems,  the  majority  of  which  are  self-limiting;  however  8-15%  of travelers are ill enough to seek medical attention while abroad or on return home, with fever as a common presenting complaint [1-4]. While  for  many  the  underlying  cause  is  a  self-limiting  globally endemic infection, such as gastroenteritis, physicians are increasingly encountering conditions not normally seen in the patient's country of origin. In some cases these are potentially life-threatening, such as malaria, and others have potential public health consequences, such as enteric fever.\\nTo evaluate returned travelers presenting with fever, an understanding of the geographic distribution of infections, risk factors for acquisition, incubation periods and clinical presentations is required. With this understanding, a risk assessment can be undertaken, initial investigations  instigated,  and,  when  appropriate,  presumptive  therapy started.\\n---\\n[FEBRILE ILLNESSES]\\nContent: Priority  should  be  given  to  identifying  illnesses  that  can  be  fatal rapidly or pose a threat to public health. Delayed diagnosis of Plasmodium  falciparum malaria  can  be  lethal,  and  undiagnosed  TB  or measles can lead to secondary cases.\\nFever  soon  after  immigration  from  malarial  countries  could  be malaria; 90% of P. falciparum cases occur within 1 month of arrival. Fever with rash suggests dengue, while fever with rash and arthritis may  indicate  chikungunya  virus.  Early  fevers  may  also  be  due  to typhoid  and  paratyphoid  fevers,  rickettsial  infections,  and  amebic liver abscesses. Fever months after migration may be caused by TB, primary malarial infection, or relapse of P. vivax and P.  ovale. Many less  common infections can be associated with fever, though other accompanying  signs  and  symptoms  may  suggest  these  diagnoses. Other febrile illness with short incubation periods, such as influenza or meningococcemia, can occur in immigrants exposed after migration, but may be more relevant to returning travelers [8]. This chapter will focus on infectious diseases that can be seen by clinicians at any time following migration and that are likely to be related to the individual's country of origin or migration process.\\n---\\n[KEY FEATURES]\\nContent: - Travel, especially to developing countries, is associated with an increased risk of infections not usually seen in highincome countries, e.g. malaria, enteric fever, dengue, and schistosomiasis\\n- While gastroenteritis, respiratory tract infections, and self-limiting viral infections are common, an important minority of patients will have a potentially life-threatening tropical infection\\n- The evaluation of an ill returned traveler therefore requires a detailed travel history together with an understanding of the geographic distribution of infections, risk factors for acquisition, incubation periods, clinical presentations and appropriate laboratory investigations\\n- A syndromic approach to speci c investigations, and to presumptive therapy pending laboratory con rmation of the diagnosis, is appropriate\\n- As a rule, malaria should be excluded in all travelers presenting with a fever who have visited the tropics\\n---\\n[MALARIA]\\nContent: Malaria may become symptomatic after the initial post-travel period, and so all returned travelers from malaria-endemic areas should be educated  about  nonspecific  symptoms  and  signs,  especially  fever, during the first few months after return. They should be advised to seek  an  early  medical  opinion  and  inform  health  professionals  of their travel history, should these symptoms occur.\\n---\\n[MALARIA [7]]\\nContent: Malaria is an important, potentially fatal infection in travelers returning from the tropics, particularly from sub-Saharan Africa. It should be  excluded  in  all  returned  travelers  with  a  history  of  fever.  Most short-term  travelers  present  within  1  month  of  return,  however P. falciparum occasionally presents up to 6 months later and P. vivax , P. ovale and P. malariae can present a year or more following return [8]. Many travelers do not take chemoprophylaxis, or take it inadequately [6]. When malaria is acquired despite chemoprophylaxis, the onset of symptoms is often delayed, severity of illness reduced, and microbiologic diagnosis may be obscured [9]. Because chemoprophylaxis  may  obscure the diagnosis, in cases where malaria is  thought likely, chemoprophylaxis should be stopped while patients are investigated [7].\\nNearly all patients with malaria give a history of fever; however, up to  half  are  afebrile  on  presentation  and  specific  fever  patterns  are uncommon [10]. Headache, myalgia, arthralgia, and malaise are frequently described, with some patients reporting diarrhea or cough. Complications occur mainly with P. falciparum infection. In patients with confusion, seizures or reduced conscious level, cerebral malaria or hypoglycemia should be considered; hypoxia, tachypnea, and signs of pulmonary edema indicate respiratory involvement.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

Fever may gradually increase over the first week of illness. Headache, anorexia, malaise, and other nonspecific,  flu-like  symptoms  are  common  and  may  precede  fever. Abdominal complaints  including  diarrhea,  constipation,  and  nonlocalizing abdominal pain each occur in less than a third of cases, but may raise clinical suspicion [16].\\nPhysical findings are also nonspecific. Relative bradycardia, or pulsetemperature dissociation, is considered a classic sign of enteric fever, but there is no widely accepted definition of relative bradycardia and little evidence that it is a useful predictor [17]. Rose spots are small, blanching pink macular lesions, typically 2-4 mm, that usually occur on the chest, abdomen and/or back during the second week of illness, but are infrequently observed. A white, yellow or brown coating of the tongue that spares the tongue's edges is common. Mild abdominal tenderness may be present. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, if present, are usually modest.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Following an incubation period of 7-18 days, Lassa fever insidiously begins with fever, weakness and malaise. More than 50% of patients experience joint and lumbar pain, and 60% or more have a nonproductive  cough.  Most  patients  also  have  severe  headache,  usually frontal, and a painful sore throat. Many also develop severe retrosternal chest pain and about half have vomiting or diarrhea and abdominal pain. On physical examination, respiratory rate, temperature and pulse rate are elevated and blood pressure may be low. About a third have conjunctivitis and more than two thirds have pharyngitis, half of whom have exudates with diffusely inflamed and swollen posterior pharynx and tonsils but with few, if any, petechiae [1-4].\\nUp to a third of hospitalized patients progress to a prostrating illness 6-8 days after onset of fever. They are often dehydrated on admission, with elevated hematocrit. Bleeding occurs in only 15-20% of patients, limited primarily to the mucosal surfaces or, occasionally, conjunctival hemorrhages or gastrointestinal or vaginal bleeding. Edema of the face and neck occurs in severe disease and carries a poor prognosisthis may indicate capillary leakage, rather than cardiac dysfunction or impaired  venous  return.  Approximately  half  of  all  patients  have diffuse abdominal tenderness, but there are no localizing signs and bowel sounds are usually active. On more than one occasion, surgery\\nhas been performed which is contraindicated.

During the next few days,  these  symptoms continue and may be  accompanied  by anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, photophobia and cough. The fever is typically high (39-41°C) and associated with a severe  frontal  headache.  Rash,  considered  the  hallmark  feature  of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, appears on day three of fever as small, pink,  blanching  macules  (typically  on  the  wrists,  ankles  and  forearms) that evolve maculopapules. Within 24 hours, it spreads centrally to involve the legs, buttocks, arms, axillae, trunk, neck and face. The entire body may be involved, including the mucous membranes of the palate and pharynx [1 1]. Characteristic of the rash are petechial lesions,  in  a  distribution  that  includes  the  palms  and  soles,  which occur in 36% to 82% of patients. In some severe cases, petechiae may coalesce to form large ecchymoses. No eschar at the inoculation site is visible. Severe manifestations may include pulmonary edema and hemorrhage, cerebral edema, myocarditis, renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and gangrene. Three factors are independent predictors of failure by the physician to initiate therapy the first time a patient is seen: absence of a rash, presentation between August 1 and April 30, and presentation within the first three days of illness. In untreated patients who survive their illness, the natural course of fever terminates after two to three weeks.\\n---\\n[PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS]\\nContent: A detailed history is helpful, especially with regard to geographical location,  season  and  mosquito  exposure.  Rapid  onset  of  arthritic symptoms is usual, with pain on movement, tenderness and slight swelling (that can be hard to detect) the most common signs. Tenderness, swelling, heat, redness and intolerance to movement or pressure can be extreme. Rash usually occurs within a few days after the onset of symptoms and resolves within 5-10 days, but can persist or recur. Rash distribution varies considerably, with the trunk and limbs most affected. The face is less affected and, rarely, the rash may be confined to palms, soles and/or digital webs. Lymphadenopathy is frequently present,  if  sought.  Aside  from  fatigue,  constitutional  symptoms usually resolve within a week [1, 8].\\nDiagnosis  is  usually  made  by  a  primary-care  physician  aided  by  a commercial serodiagnostic ELISA-based test (widely available in Australia).  Paired  serologic  testing  at  least  10-14  days  apart  is  recommended.  Peripheral  blood  counts  are  usually  normal  except  for  a possible slight  neutrophilia.  An  elevated  erythrocyte  sedimentation rate  can occur,  but decreases within a few weeks.  Serum C  reactive protein levels are rarely elevated. Erosive changes in x-rays are generally not seen [8].\\nThe  differential  diagnoses  at  initial  disease  presentation  include related  Old  World  alphaviruses  (e.g.  chikungunya,  Barmah  Forest or  Sindbis  virus.  [6]),  dengue  and  Epstein-Barr  virus.  Other  viral arthritides may  also be considered, for example rubella or parvovirus B19 [5, 8]. Drug reactions, autoimmune  arthritides (e.g. rheumatoid  arthritis  and  systemic  lupus  erythematosis)  and  other infectious arthritides may also be among the differential diagnoses. Persistent distinct monoarticular arthritis is not consistent with RRV disease [8].\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Most patients with VEE have a history of exposure to mosquitoes in regions  of  humid  tropical  forests  or  have  been  present  during  an equine epizootic  [2]. Following  an  incubation  period  of  1-5  days, chills, headache, fever, body aches and prostration begin abruptly [3]. Asthenia,  dizziness  and  acute  discomfort  are  incapacitating.  Lumbosacral pain is common, along with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and a sore throat. After defervescence, a dull headache and weakness may persist for several days; fever and symptoms occasionally recrudesce. Although signs of mild neurologic involvement are common, only about 4% of infected children progress to frank neurologic disease; adults rarely do. Signs include nuchal rigidity, stupor, coma, delirium, seizures, cranial nerve palsies, motor weakness, paralysis, nystagmus, pathologic reflexes and spastic paralysis. Elevated intracranial pressure and  meningismus  occur  in  most  childhood  cases.  Approximately 0.5% of all symptomatic cases are fatal, nearly all in children. However, many survivors of neurologic disease experience sequelae, including memory problems, nervousness, asthenia, recurrent seizures, motor impairment, psychomotor retardation and behavioral disorders.\\nEastern  equine  encephalitis  typically  begins  after  3-10  days  of incubation with the sudden onset of headache, fever, chills, photophobia, dysethesias, myalgia, malaise and vomiting [1, 2, 4]. In infants, encephalitis caused by eastern equine encephalitis virus is characterized  by  abrupt  onset,  but  in  older  children  and  adults  is manifested after a few days of systemic illness. Patients may recover or  can  progress to more severe neurologic illness beginning with a worsening headache, dizziness, vomiting, lethargy and progressing to neck  stiffness,  confusion  and  convulsions.  Severe  cases  requiring hospitalization may involve seizures, disorientation and coma. The course of illness may be rapid in infants; infants are most likely to suffer neurologic sequelae,  such  as  motor  weakness, paralysis, aphasia, mental retardation and seizures. Many patients with permanent sequelae die a few years later.\\n---\\n[N O N I N FE CTI O U S  DI S E A S E S O F I M M I G RA N TS]\\nContent: Fatigue, bruising, and nonhealing sores can suggest blood disorders, including anemias and thalassemias, particularly among people from the Mediterranean, Africa, and Asia. Some of these blood disorders are genetic, whereas others are caused by nutritional disorders such as  iron,  B12 or  folate deficiency,  or chronic diseases  such as hookworm infestation, HIV, lead intoxication, kidney  disease,  or malignancy.  In the future, it is likely that  immigrants  will  bear  a disproportionate  burden  of disease  due to infection-associated cancers, such as hepatoma from chronic hepatitis B and C, carcinoma of  the  cervix  caused  by  human  papillomavirus,  Epstein-Barr  virusassociated Burkitt lymphoma, human herpesvirus-8-associated Kaposi sarcoma, and HIV-associated lymphomas.\\nMalnutrition and stunting of growth can be especially severe in immigrant children and refugees as a result of food deprivation and infections. Malabsorption can result from intestinal protozoan infections or,  rarely,  tropical  sprue;  lactose  intolerance  is  common  among African and certain Asian immigrant groups. Immigrants may present with  specific  nutritional  disorders  such  as  bowing  of  the  legs  in children or osteomalacia in adults with vitamin D deficiency, xerophthalmia secondary to vitamin A deficiency, endemic goiter associated with iodine deficiency, or acrodermatitis with zinc deficiency.\\nDepression  and  stress  are  common  among  immigrants  who  are adapting to a new culture and language. Post-traumatic stress disorder and other psychiatric problems are not uncommon among refugees, especially those who have experienced torture, rape, and other physical trauma in war-torn countries. Those who care for immigrants may find  that  disclosures  of  trauma  occur  only  after  development  of  a trusting  relationship  with  the  healthcare  provider.  There  are  many validated  screening  instruments  available,  including  the  Harvard Trauma Questionnaire to check for post-traumatic stress disorder, the Hopkins Symptom Checklist which screens for anxiety, and the Beck Depression Inventory [17].\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

The clinical course and confirmatory laboratory test ruled out other neurological conditions considered in the differential.\\nVitals: On admission, his blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, pulse 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute, and temperature 38.5°C (101.3°F).\\nContent: A 20-year-old man presented with fever for 4 days, followed by tingling and weakness that began in his left leg and then rapidly progressed to involve all four limbs over the next 2 days.

Other symptoms include post-orbital  pain  (typically  exacerbated by movement), pain in  the lower limbs and back, constipation, a rash on the face, and a loss of appetite [12]. The first episode of fever may last 2-4 days and may be followed  by  relapses  every  4-6  days,  giving  rise  to  trench  fever's\\nFIGURE  67. 1 Body  louse,  a  vector  for B.  quintana ,  sucking  blood  on  a homeless patient.\\nFIGURE 67. 2 Pediculosis and super infection in a homeless man seeking care during a snapshot intervention in shelters.

Although trench fever often results in prolonged disability, it is rarely fatal.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Mayaro fever\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was Mayaro fever, caused by Mayaro virus (MAYV). This was confirmed by serological testing showing a positive Mayaro IgM-IFA (1280 on 29 August, 40 on 12 September) and IgG-IFA (2560 on both dates) with a confirmatory plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) that rose from 40 to 160. The diagnosis aligns with the patient's travel history to the Amazon Basin, the preceding dengue-like febrile illness, and the characteristic prolonged symmetrical polyarthralgias primarily affecting small peripheral joints, while other common travel-related viral and bacterial causes were ruled out by serology.\\nVitals: No specific vital signs were reported other than the occurrence of an acute febrile illness with chills.\\nContent: During the second week of a 3.5-week trip to the Amazon Basin of northern Peru, the patient developed an acute febrile illness with chills, malaise, frontal headache, generalized myalgia, and a transient, non-pruritic maculopapular rash. The rash began on the forearms about 1 week after fever onset, spread to the trunk, neck, and face, and faded after 3 days. Slowly progressive, debilitating polyarthralgias affecting peripheral joints, with transient joint swelling, also developed. Painful cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy lasted for about 1 week. Fever and other acute symptoms subsided within 1 week, but polyarthralgias persisted, showing a symmetrical pattern mainly affecting the small joints of the hands and feet, wrists, ankles, and knees. Upon return to Switzerland a few weeks later, the patient reported stiffness of the affected joints, mainly in the morning and after immobility, and the joint pains did not improve for two more months.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Amoebic liver abscess\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is an amoebic liver abscess, caused by Entamoeba histolytica. This is supported by the clinical triad of fever and tender hepatomegaly with right intercostal tenderness, imaging findings of a large solitary liver lesion with an elevated hemidiaphragm, and the aspiration of characteristic 'brownish pus'. The diagnosis was further confirmed by the patient's rapid clinical response to metronidazole therapy and the relevant epidemiological risk factor of consuming locally brewed alcohol known to be associated with amoebiasis.\\nVitals: On examination, the patient's temperature was 38.3 °C (100.8 °F), blood pressure was 100/80 mmHg, pulse was 102 bpm, and respiratory rate was 24 breath cycles per minute.\\nContent: For the past week, the patient experienced fever, chills, headache, and body aches, along with severe right-hypochondrial pain. The abdominal pain is described as constant, dull, radiating to the right shoulder, and exacerbated by coughing and resting on the right side. Over the last few days, he also developed a dry cough, has vomited twice, and has lost his appetite.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

Infected  rodents  move freely  in  their  natural  habitat  and  may  invade  human  dwellings. Humans are  infected  through  mucosal  exposure  to  aerosols  or  by direct  contact  of  abraded  skin  with  infectious  material.  Person-toperson transmission is very rare and may occur via direct contact with infected body fluids (e.g. sexual transmission) of a viremic patient; nosocomial infections have also been reported. Nevertheless, agricultural  workers  (mostly  male  adults)  have  historically  been  at  the highest risk for infection while working around potentially infected rodents in fields.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Visceral leishmaniasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar), caused by a Leishmania protozoan. This diagnosis is supported by the patient's presentation with chronic undulating fever, severe malnutrition, splenomegaly, generalized lymphadenopathy, and pancytopenia. Epidemiological risk was high, as she was from a known endemic area with a family history of the disease. Although an initial rK39 RDT was negative, the diagnosis was confirmed by a positive Direct Agglutination Test (DAT) with a high titre of 1:6400 and a definitive clinical response to treatment with liposomal amphotericin B.\\nVitals: On presentation, her vital signs were: temperature 39.6°C (103.3°F), pulse 96 bpm, and blood pressure 100/60 mmHg.\\nContent: For the past four weeks, the patient has experienced an undulating fever, occurring mainly in the afternoon, accompanied by chills and occasional convulsions. Initially, she was well between febrile episodes and played normally. However, over time she has developed progressive anorexia, a dry cough, chest pain, and joint and back pain.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Rabies\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was paralytic rabies, caused by the rabies lyssavirus. This was confirmed by the detection of rabies viral RNA through RT-PCR in a saliva sample collected at admission. The diagnosis was strongly supported by the patient's history of a WHO category III stray dog bite in a rabies-endemic country, the rapidly progressive febrile quadriparesis, the development of autonomic instability, and the critical omission of rabies immunoglobulin during post-exposure prophylaxis. The clinical course and confirmatory laboratory test ruled out other neurological conditions considered in the differential.\\nVitals: On admission, his blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, pulse 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute, and temperature 38.5°C (101.3°F).\\nContent: A 20-year-old man presented with fever for 4 days, followed by tingling and weakness that began in his left leg and then rapidly progressed to involve all four limbs over the next 2 days. The onset of symptoms occurred about one month after a stray dog bite. After admission, he developed autonomic instability, evidenced by increased perspiration and significant variability in heart rate and blood pressure. He also developed dysphagia and respiratory distress, requiring mechanical ventilation on the third day after hospitalization. The patient died due to sudden cardiac arrest on the fifth day of hospitalization, which was nine days post-onset of symptoms.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Tuberculous Lymphadenitis with Paradoxical IRIS\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was tuberculous lymphadenitis with superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis, complicated by paradoxical immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). The initial diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis was confirmed by an AFB-positive fine-needle aspirate from a neck gland. The paradoxical IRIS was diagnosed clinically based on his worsening condition after starting ART, despite evidence of a good virologic and immunologic response. The superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis, likely with Staphylococcus aureus, was confirmed by the second aspirate showing purulent material with coccoid bacteria and the patient's rapid improvement following incision, drainage, and antibiotics.\\nVitals: On presentation, he was febrile with a temperature of 39.2 °C (102.56° F). His pulse was 112 bpm, respiratory rate was 28 breaths per minute, and he had a normal blood pressure.\\nContent: For six weeks, the patient has experienced a productive cough and chest pain, associated with systemic symptoms including weight loss, fevers, and night sweats. During this period, he also developed a painful swelling in his neck. He has no other reported symptoms.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES [4]]\\nContent: Ticks  are  picked  up  in  the  countryside  or  from  domestic  animals, particularly dogs, in the home. The majority of patients and almost all fatal cases are children. After the tick has been attached for 5-6 days, a progressive ascending, lower motor neuron paralysis develops with paraesthesiae. Often, a child, who may have been irritable for the previous 24 h, falls on getting out of bed first thing in the morning and is found to be weak or ataxic. Paralysis increases over the next few  days:  death  results  from  bulbar  and  respiratory  paralysis  and aspiration  of  stomach  contents.  Vomiting  is  a  feature  of  the  more acute course of I. holocyclus envenoming.\\nThis  clinical  picture  is  often  misinterpreted  as  poliomyelitis.  Other neurologic conditions, including Guillain-Barré syndrome, paralytic rabies, Eaton-Lambert syndrome, myasthenia gravis or botulism, may also be suspected. Diagnosis depends on finding the tick, which is likely to be concealed in a crevice, orifice or hairy area of the body. The scalp is the commonest place. Fatal tick paralysis has been caused by a tick attached to the tympanic membrane.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

However, as the illness progresses, the differential would include other intestinal protozoa, including Giardia lamblia .  A  rare  cause  of  illness  in  travelers, Cystoisospora  belli ,  can  produce  a  prolonged  diarrhea  after  travel,  and  is sensitive to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Fatigue and weight loss can be caused by Entamoeba histolytica , but anorexia is not as prominent. Dientamoeba fragilis can cause prolonged, low-grade intestinal symptoms, but without anorexia or weight loss. Fatigue and weight loss can be due to tropical sprue, which is a rare cause of prolonged diarrhea  in  travelers.  Celiac  sprue  occasionally  manifests  during foreign travel.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Spinal cord schistosomiasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The patient was diagnosed with spinal cord schistosomiasis complicating an infection with Schistosoma haematobium. The diagnosis was established based on the clinical presentation of a conus syndrome, a clear exposure history of swimming in Lake Malawi, the prior identification of S. haematobium eggs in his urine, significant peripheral eosinophilia, and characteristic MRI findings of a lesion in the conus medullaris and bladder wall thickening. His complete recovery following treatment with praziquantel and corticosteroids further supports the diagnosis.\\nVitals: He has normal vital signs; specific values were not reported.\\nContent: For three weeks, the patient experienced progressive difficulty urinating, requiring increasing abdominal pressure and only being able to pass small amounts at a time, associated with lower abdominal discomfort, abnormal sensations in the groins and genitals, and some erectile dysfunction. He also reports that walking did not feel normal, though he could not specify the abnormality. He denies weakness, dysaesthesia, or loss of sensation in his legs, and has no backache. Over the past two months, he had an unintentional weight loss of 8kg and fatigue without fever or night sweats. One week prior to presentation, he noticed a single episode of reddish urine discoloration without painful micturition or fever, for which he was treated at a local clinic. There is no history of trauma.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Stevens-Johnson syndrome\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), a severe drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction. This clinical diagnosis is based on the patient's generalized maculopapular rash with extensive mucous membrane involvement (oral, conjunctival, genital), which appeared approximately four weeks after starting nevirapine and co-trimoxazole, both of which are highly implicated drugs. The diagnosis is further supported by the much higher incidence of SJS in HIV-positive individuals. Infectious causes like malaria were ruled out with negative testing.\\nVitals: Temperature is 37.7°C (99.9°F), blood pressure is 120/68 mmHg, pulse is 90 bpm, and respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute.\\nContent: The patient developed a productive cough with whitish sputum, followed one day later by a generalized skin rash that started on her trunk and spread to the extremities and mucosal membranes. Over the past two days, she also developed a sore throat and dysuria. The rash involves her lips, oral mucosa, conjunctivae, and genital mucosa, and has made talking and eating difficult and painful.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Bartonellosis (Oroya fever)\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is acute bartonellosis, also known as Oroya fever, caused by Bartonella bacilliformis. The diagnosis was definitively established by the thin blood film showing massive red blood cell infestation with cocco-bacillary structures characteristic of the organism. This was supported by the clinical presentation of severe haemolytic anaemia, fever, and neurologic impairment, along with a compatible exposure history in an endemic region of Peru. Malaria was ruled out by negative blood smears.\\nVitals: On admission, his blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg, pulse was 110 bpm and regular, temperature was 39.2 °C (102.6 °F), and respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute.\\nContent: Daily fever began three months after a vacation in the Peruvian highlands. In the second week of illness, the patient developed dark urine and jaundice.

Toxin-induced  secretory  diarrhea  continues  independent  of  food intake. Malabsorption of carbohydrate in the small intestine leads to fermentation of unabsorbed substrates by colonic bacteria; this may cause bloating, the passage of much rectal gas and frothy stools, which are all characteristic of giardiasis. Cryptosporidiosis can involve both small and large bowel, causing short-lived and self-limiting diarrhea; however, the infection can be prolonged in patients with impaired immune responses.

The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by stool microscopy showing characteristic motile bacilli inhibited by specific antiserum and by positive stool culture for V. cholerae.\\nVitals: On admission, the patient was afebrile with a pulse rate of 110 bpm (low volume) and a blood pressure of 90/50 mmHg. After initial intravenous rehydration, her pulse rate improved to 84 bpm and her blood pressure rose to 100/70 mmHg.\\nContent: The patient developed profuse, large-volume watery diarrhoea, passing 12 to 15 stools in the past day. The stools were described as resembling diluted milk or rice water with white flakes. The illness was notable for the absence of abdominal pain or fever.

The clinical presentation of greasy, foul-smelling stools, bloating, and evidence of carbohydrate malabsorption (positive reducing substances in stool) is classic for this infection.\\nVitals: The patient has no fever; no other vital signs are reported.\\nContent: For the past two weeks, the patient has experienced four to five episodes of loose stools per day, accompanied by weight loss, anorexia, malaise, flatulence, and abdominal cramping during defecation. For the last three days, he has noted bloating and distension after consuming milk products. While he has mild nausea, he reports no fever. His stools were initially watery, but after a 5-day course of ciprofloxacin from a local pharmacy (which ended two days ago), they are now three to four per day and described as mushy, greasy, and foul-smelling.\\n---\\n[TRAVELER'S DIARRHEA]\\nContent: Campylobacter species  is  an  important  cause  of  traveler's  diarrhea. Most Campylobacter infections in travelers cause symptoms, although frank dysentery is rare. In a study of Spanish travelers with Campylobacter enteritis acquired in developing countries, only 4% had dysentery. Abdominal cramps were present in 83% of cases, fever in 46%, nausea and vomiting in 42%, and grossly bloody diarrhea in only 3% of cases [6, 7].\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Cholera\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is cholera, caused by Vibrio cholerae O1, Serotype Ogawa, biotype El Tor. This was established based on the classic clinical syndrome of profuse rice-water diarrhea leading to severe dehydration and shock, combined with a clear epidemiological link to a contaminated water source during an outbreak. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by stool microscopy showing characteristic motile bacilli inhibited by specific antiserum and by positive stool culture for V. cholerae.\\nVitals: On admission, the patient was afebrile with a pulse rate of 110 bpm (low volume) and a blood pressure of 90/50 mmHg. After initial intravenous rehydration, her pulse rate improved to 84 bpm and her blood pressure rose to 100/70 mmHg.\\nContent: The patient developed profuse, large-volume watery diarrhoea, passing 12 to 15 stools in the past day. The stools were described as resembling diluted milk or rice water with white flakes. The illness was notable for the absence of abdominal pain or fever. Approximately one hour prior to presentation, she became unresponsive, prompting her husband to bring her to the hospital.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

Now I’m worried because I heard some insects there can spread parasites. What could this be?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Bites,  for  example  by  the  large  aggressive  flies  variously  known  as horse flies, gadflies or cleggs (Tabanidae), may be immediately painful and traumatic but the commonest problem is delayed local swelling and itching from exposure to insects' salivary allergens incurred by previous bites. A small, intensely itchy, reddish lump with a central (hemorrhagic)  punctum  develops  immediately  or  after  a  delay  of 24-48 hours. A papule, urticarial weal, blister or bulla may develop (e.g.  after  'Blandford  fly' Simulium posticatum bites  in  Oxfordshire, UK), or bites may provoke a more generalized erythema multiforme or,  especially  in  children,  papular  urticaria,  and  sometimes  even systemic  anaphylaxis  may  be  provoked.  Triatomine  bug  bites  are usually multiple - often near the eye or angle of the mouth. They are painful, swollen, ooze blood and may be surrounded by black staining from the bug's feces (see Chapter 98, 'Chagas' Disease'). Scratching may lead to secondary infection, an inflamed, painful pustule or carbuncle, or a demarcated, hot, bright red, raised area of erysipelas or cellulitis. Causative bacteria include Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes . The risk of secondary infection seems to be higher under humid tropical conditions. It may be difficult to distinguish between  envenoming  or  allergy,  resulting  in  early  symptoms  after minutes or a few hours, and infection, resulting in late symptoms after many hours or even days.\\nFIGURE 136.2.1 Bug bite, São Paulo, Brazil (© David A.

Their eggs are deposited on biting arthropods, such as mosquitoes, which carry them to the  skin  of  the  host.  Here,  the  eggs  hatch  and  the  larvae  burrow into the skin. As the  larva grows  over a period of 10 weeks, a boil develops with a small aperture. Larvae may grow to more than 1 cm\\nremoval of the larvae, debridement of affected tissue and treatment of secondary infection. Reconstructive surgery may be required.\\nOPHTHALMOMYIASIS (OCULAR\\nMYIASIS) [5, 61\\nin  length  (Fig.  136.3.1A,  B).  An  early  symptom  is  sporadic  pain caused by the spiny larva. Unless the eye is involved, infestation is generally  harmless.  Secondary  infection  of  the  wound  is  the  most common complication.\\nTumbu flies, also known as putsi fIy or ver du cayor ( Cordylobia anthropophaga Calliphoridae),  occur  throughout  sub-Saharan  Africa  and southern  Spain.  Females  lay  their  eggs,  usually  on  urine-  or  fecescontaminated sand or moist soil, and on clothes hung outside to dry. Skin contact with viable ova on clothing results in infestation. Larvae penetrate the skin and grow rapidly to mature in about 10 days. A painful inflamed boil develops which seems to wriggle, exudes bloodstained pus and has a definite head, through which the larval spiracles may  protrude  (Fig.  136.3.2).  There  may  be  associated  fever  and lymphadenopathy.\\nLarvae of warble flies ( Hypoderma spp.)  and  horse bot  flies, Gasterophilus spp.  (Oestridae),  can  invade  human  skin  causing  intense itching and a creeping eruption.\\n---\\n[OPHTHALMOMYIASIS <OCULAR MYIASIS= [5, 6]]\\nContent: Human victims  may  give  a  history  of  having  been  buzzed  in  the face or struck on the eye by an insect and later of developing irritation and  redness  of  the  eye,  foreign  body  sensation,  pain,  lacrimation, palpebral edema and signs of purulent conjunctivitis or a stye (hordeolum). Oestrus  ovis larvae  rarely  develop  beyond  the  first  instar  in humans and so symptoms are self-limiting, but they may be more rapidly relieved by slit lamp examination and removal of larvae which cling to the conjunctivae and may cause follicular conjunctival reaction and pseudomembrane formation. Other causes of human ophthalmomyiasis  include Rhinoestrus  purpureum,  Dermatobia  hominis, Hypoderma spp.,  (Oestridae),  and Cochlyomyia  hominis,  Lucilia spp. and Phormia spp. (Calliphoridae). Larvae of Hypoderma, Cochlyomyia and Dermatobia are more dangerous as they may burrow into the eye, resulting  in  pain,  nausea  and  destruction.  They  must  be  surgically removed.\\nCongo floor maggots, larvae  of the fly Auchmeromyia luteola live  in earthen  floors  of  huts  throughout  tropical  Africa  between  latitudes 18°N and 26°S. They suck blood from those sleeping on the ground, causing local swelling and itching.\\n---\\n[FACTORS INFLUENCING TRANSMISSION]\\nContent: Other  extrinsic  factors  may  influence  whether  an  individual  insect becomes infected with a pathogen. For example, it has been shown that mosquitoes ingesting blood containing both microfilariae and Rift Valley fever virus have a higher viral infection rate because disseminated virus infection is facilitated by microfilariae escaping from the midgut into the hemocoel. Other factors can also influence this 'leaky  gut'  phenomenon.  Finally,  infection  of  the  arthropod  and subsequent transmission is influenced by the strain of pathogen. This is especially important with the arboviruses, where certain strains or subtypes of virus have greater infectivity and more rapid replication in the vectors [2].\\nBecause arthropods are cold-blooded, transmission of diseases in temperate regions is seasonal, usually only occurring during warm months. Cessation of transmission in these regions is usually determined by temperature and day length. In the tropics and subtropics, transmission generally occurs year-round. In these areas, increased seasonal transmission is most frequently correlated with the rainy season.\\n---\\n[SPECIFIC INFECTIONS TRANSMITTED BY BITING FLIES <DIPTERA= AND BUGS <HEMIPTERA=]\\nContent: - Mosquitoes  (family  Culicidae)  transmit  many  viral  infections, malaria, lymphatic filariasis and myiasis.\\n- Sandflies  (subfamily  Phlebotominae)  transmit  Phlebovirus  (Pappataci) fever, Oroya fever ( Bartonella bacilliformis ) and leishmaniasis.\\n●\\nTsetse flies (family Glossinidae) transmit African trypanosomiasis.\\n- Chrysops or deer flies (family Tabanidae) transmit Loa loa .\\n- Black flies (family Simuliidae) transmit onchocerciasis.\\n- Reduviid bugs (family Reduviidae) transmit American trypanosomiasis.\\n- Giant  water  bugs  (family  Belastomatidae)  may  transmit  Buruli ulcer.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

The condition is caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. The diagnosis was made clinically based on the presence of all five key signs: follicles on the tarsal conjunctiva, conjunctival scarring, fibrovascular pannus, trichiasis, and corneal opacity.

A frankly purulent discharge is especially common in gonococcal infections. Mucopurulent and purulent discharges frequently accumulate on the eyelashes and lid margins, causing the lids to stick together.\\nThe most consistent sign of conjunctivitis is conjunctival injection. The superficial and tortuous vessels of the conjunctiva appear dilated and bright red or pink, giving rise to the common term 'pink eye' . In severe inflammation, pseudomembranes, or even true membranes, may  be  present.  These  are  seen  as  dirty  gray  sloughs  on  the  tarsal conjunctiva. In viral and chlamydial conjunctivitis, follicles are frequently present. Giant, fleshy papillae may occur in allergic conjunctivitis.

This is strongly supported by the patient's demographic profile (an HIV-positive woman from sub-Saharan Africa), the characteristic history of a progressively enlarging conjunctival lesion over several months, and the clinical findings of a large ocular tumor with vision loss and regional lymph node involvement. Although not confirmed by biopsy, the presentation is classic for this condition in the described epidemiological context.\\nVitals: The patient is afebrile. No other vital signs were reported.\\nContent: Symptoms began 8 months prior with a whitish lesion on the conjunctiva of her left eye. Despite treatment with non-specified eye drops from a health center and herbal eye drops from a traditional healer, the lesion grew larger and became reddish. Over the following months, she progressively lost eyesight in the affected eye and developed increasing pain, which prompted her to seek care at a district hospital.\\n---\\n[KERATITIS AND CORNEAL ULCERATION]\\nContent: Keratitis and corneal ulceration are common causes of painful, red eyes and are usually uni-ocular. Severe photophobia is often the main symptom, and the vision is usually blurred. Secondary uveitis may develop and cause ciliary injection. Ciliary injection shows a ring of redness, which is most intense around the limbus, and is a sign of inflammation of the ciliary body and iris. A history of trauma can often be elicited. At other times, a corneal ulcer and, more especially,\\nLens\\nVitreous body\\nOptic disc\\nSclera\\nFIGURE  9.2 A  diagram  of  the  front  of eye  and  a  cross-sectional  diagram  of the eye.\\nOptic nerve\\nFIGURE 9.3 Eversion of the upper eye lid.\\nkeratitis may occur as a result of viral or severe bacterial conjunctivitis, in  which  case  the  signs  of  conjunctivitis  may  coexist.  Sometimes, corneal ulcers develop spontaneously, especially with herpetic keratitis and are particularly common following measles.\\nThe most important diagnostic sign is the appearance of a corneal defect - either an opacity, which will obscure underlying iris details, or a surface defect, which will distort the surface light reflex. If an ulcer penetrates  the  cornea,  the  globe  may  collapse  and  the  intraocular contents  may be expelled.  The hole in the cornea may be plugged with a knuckle of iris which then shows as dark tissue in the base of the ulcer. A  small ulcer, such as a dendritic ulcer caused by herpes simplex, is best seen if fluorescein is instilled and the eye is observed with a blue light. Large infective ulcers frequently are filled with white sloughed material and other debris. At times, pus may accumulate in the anterior chamber as a hypopyon.\\nMost  corneal  ulcers  are  medical  emergencies  and  these  patients should be under the care of an ophthalmologist. Proper management frequently requires a microbiologic diagnosis of the infectious agent, using  isolation  cultures.  Intensive  topical  antibiotics  are  used.  For bacterial keratitis, commercially available antibiotics drops, e.g. chloramphenicol, ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin, can be used every hour.\\n---\\n[OPHTHALMOMYIASIS <OCULAR MYIASIS= [5, 6]]\\nContent: Human victims  may  give  a  history  of  having  been  buzzed  in  the face or struck on the eye by an insect and later of developing irritation and  redness  of  the  eye,  foreign  body  sensation,  pain,  lacrimation, palpebral edema and signs of purulent conjunctivitis or a stye (hordeolum).

This was confirmed by the detection of rabies viral RNA through RT-PCR in a saliva sample collected at admission. The diagnosis was strongly supported by the patient's history of a WHO category III stray dog bite in a rabies-endemic country, the rapidly progressive febrile quadriparesis, the development of autonomic instability, and the critical omission of rabies immunoglobulin during post-exposure prophylaxis. The clinical course and confirmatory laboratory test ruled out other neurological conditions considered in the differential.\\nVitals: On admission, his blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, pulse 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute, and temperature 38.5°C (101.3°F).\\nContent: A 20-year-old man presented with fever for 4 days, followed by tingling and weakness that began in his left leg and then rapidly progressed to involve all four limbs over the next 2 days. The onset of symptoms occurred about one month after a stray dog bite. After admission, he developed autonomic instability, evidenced by increased perspiration and significant variability in heart rate and blood pressure. He also developed dysphagia and respiratory distress, requiring mechanical ventilation on the third day after hospitalization. The patient died due to sudden cardiac arrest on the fifth day of hospitalization, which was nine days post-onset of symptoms.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL EFFECTS [4]]\\nContent: The patient who has been bitten by a snake may present with symptoms resulting from fear, from prehospital treatment and from effects of the venom itself. Snake bite is usually a terrifying experience, especially for those who believe that all bites are rapidly fatal. Physiologic manifestations of anxiety, and even frank hysteria, may confuse the clinical  picture. Thus, patients who are bitten, but not envenomed, may feel flushed and breathless, with constriction of the chest, and a thumping pulse,  palpitations,  sweating and  effects of  hyperventilation,  such  as  faintness,  acroparesthesia  and  even  tetany,  may  be noticed.  Such  symptoms  dominate  many  accounts  of  snake  bites written  by  the  victims  and  are  falsely  attributed  to  neurotoxicity. Misguided traditional  prehospital  treatments  can  result  in  swelling and ischemia of limbs whose circulation is occluded by tourniquets, bleeding or sensory loss resulting from local incisions, vomiting and other side effects caused by ingested herbal remedies, smarting eyes and  conjunctivitis  from  instillation  of  plant  juices,  and  bronchospasm  from  insufflation  of  oils.  Rarely,  snake  bite  may  precipitate vaso-vagal collapse, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmia.\\n---\\n[SYMPTOMS OF ENVENOMING [6-9]]\\nContent: Envenoming by H. suspectum and H. horridum causes identical clinical syndromes. Pain may start immediately and is described as throbbing or burning. It may radiate up the bitten limb to the shoulder, chest and epigastrium, and is often excruciating in intensity, persisting for 24 hours or more. Swelling also develops rapidly, extending, in some cases, to involve the whole limb, but although it may be tense, compartment  syndrome  has  never  been  described.  The  bite  site  is  erythematous  or  cyanosed  with  traumatic  ecchymoses  and  persistent bleeding, but tissue necrosis does not develop. Red lymphangitic lines extend up the limb and regional lymph glands may become tender and enlarged. Local paresthesia, hyperesthesia and even paralysis have been  described.  The  earliest  systemic  symptoms  start  within  five minutes of the bite: dizziness, weakness, nausea, vomiting, profuse generalized sweating, breathlessness and weakness. Hypotension and tachycardia are commonly recorded. These symptoms may be transient or recurrent. Less commonly, there is angioedema (swelling of lips,  tongue,  throat  and  upper  airway)  [10],  increased  secretions, chills, fever and tinnitus.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Snake bite envenomation\\nDiagnosis Details: Delayed presentation of snake bite envenomation with secondary sepsis and severe tissue necrosis. The envenomation was most likely caused by an African puff-adder (*Bitis arietans*), based on the snake's distinct physical description, its behavior, the geographic location in Malawi, and the clinical presentation of severe local cytotoxic effects (haemorrhagic bullae, massive swelling, extensive necrosis) and initial systemic haematotoxicity (bleeding gums). The patient's septic shock on arrival was a late complication of the untreated necrotic wound.\\nVitals: On admission, the patient appeared weak and was in respiratory distress. His temperature was 39.4 °C, pulse 126 bpm, blood pressure 85/60 mmHg, and respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute.\\nContent: Three weeks prior to presentation, the patient was bitten by a snake while playing in rocky grassland. The snake was described as brown with V-shaped black bands and approximately one metre long. Shortly after the bite, he developed haemorrhagic bullae on his right leg, bleeding gums, and extensive vomiting. He was initially taken to a traditional healer, after which the bleeding and vomiting resolved. However, he subsequently developed intense pain and swelling at the bite site, which progressed to the current necrotic wound.\\n---\\n[FURIOUS RABIES [5]]\\nContent: This is the more commonly recognized presentation. After a few days of prodromal symptoms, the pathognomonic symptom and sign of hydrophobia or aerophobia develops (Fig. 34.1.1). A series of forceful, jerky, inspiratory spasms is provoked either by attempts to drink water or by a draft of air on the face. Both reflexes are associated with a  compelling,  but  inexplicable  terror.  Splashing  water  on  the  skin, irritation of the respiratory tract, or, by conditioning, the sight, sound, or  even  the  mention  of  water  may  provoke  a  hydrophobic  spasm. Patients  also  experience  episodic  generalized  arousal  during  which they  become  wild,  hallucinated  and  sometimes  aggressive.  During lucid intervals, they cerebrate normally and are aware of their terrible predicament. Neurologic abnormalities include meningism, cranial nerve lesions, upper motor neuron lesions, fasciculation and involuntary  movements.  Generalized  hyperesthesia  or  hyperacusis  is described. Hypersalivation, lacrimation (Fig. 34.1.2), sweating, fluctuating blood pressure and body temperature, and diabetes insipidus, or  rarely,  inappropriate  secretion  of  antidiuretic  hormone,  suggest disturbances of the hypothalamus. Lesions of the amygdaloid nuclei probably  account  for  increased  libido,  priapism  and  spontaneous orgasms. Without intensive care, most patients die within a few days\\nFIGURE 34.1.1 Hydrophobic spasm ending in opisthotonos in an African boy with furious rabies.

Rabies is caused by the rabies virus, which \\nspreads through the saliva of infected mammals — most often from bites by dogs, bats, raccoons, foxes, or other wild animals. Rarely, it can enter through saliva touching an \\nopen wound or the eyes or mouth. The risk is higher if the bite was from a wild or stray animal, happened in a country where rabies is common, or if the wound was on the head \\nor neck (allowing the virus to reach the brain faster). Immediate medical care is critical, as rabies is almost always fatal once symptoms appear.'}]},\n",

What could this be?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Cutaneous larva migrans\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is cutaneous larva migrans (CLM), caused by the accidental infestation of human skin by larvae of dog and cat hookworms. This was diagnosed clinically based on the pathognomonic finding of pruritic, serpiginous tracks on the skin, supported by a clear exposure history of skin contact with sand in an endemic area (Thailand/Australia). The diagnosis was confirmed by the rapid and complete resolution of symptoms after a single dose of ivermectin.\\nContent: The patient developed three intensely itchy skin eruptions on both upper thighs just after arriving in Australia, one week prior to presentation. The itch was so severe that it kept him awake at night. He reported no fever, cough, or wheeze and was otherwise completely well.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Onchocerciasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is onchocerciasis (river blindness), caused by the filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus. The diagnosis was established based on the highly typical clinical triad of chronic pruritic dermatitis, subcutaneous nodules over bony prominences, and characteristic corneal opacities (sclerosing keratitis). This is strongly supported by the patient's lifelong residency in an endemic region of Togo near a fast-flowing river, the known breeding site for the Simulium blackfly vector.\\nContent: The patient has noticed changes in both eyes over the past 4 years, without current visual disturbances, but he is worried because adults in his village have gone blind after similar changes. For the past two decades, he has developed multiple painless bumps under his skin. He also suffers from intense itching of his skin that is severe enough to keep him awake at night.\\n---\\n[SKIN DISEASE]\\nContent: The  earliest  and  most  troublesome  symptom  of  onchocercal  skin involvement is itching [6]. The skin changes have been classified as acute papular onchodermatitis (APOD), chronic papular onchodermatitis  (CPOD),  lichenified  onchodermatitis  (LOD),  atrophy,  and depigmentation [6]. More than one skin disease type can coexist in an individual. APOD consists of small pruritic papules (Fig. 1 12.6A). Because of pruritus,  there can  be excoriations,  secondary infection, and ulceration. APOD is the typical presentation in individuals with short exposure histories, and in such individuals, microfilariae may not be detectable.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Paucibacillary leprosy\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is paucibacillary leprosy, a disease of the skin and peripheral nerves caused by Mycobacterium leprae. This diagnosis was made clinically based on the presence of two cardinal signs: a hypopigmented, anaesthetic skin macule on the right arm and a thickened right ulnar nerve. Given these definitive clinical findings, diagnostic tests like skin biopsy or slit-skin smears were not required for confirmation.\\nContent: For the past three months, the patient noticed a pale patch on his right arm and forearm. The lesion is not itchy or painful, but he reports reduced sensation in the affected area. He also complains of mild numbness of the little finger of his right hand but has experienced no weakness. He reports being generally well with no other symptoms.\\n---\\n[DISSEMINATED PRURITUS WITH OR WITHOUT RASH]\\nContent: Scabies is the most common cause of diffuse pruritic skin disease [4]. The patient complains of generalized and intense itching, worsening at  night,  usually  sparing  the  face  and  head.  Specific  skin  findings include 5- to 10-mm burrows, and papulonodular genital lesions. The classic  distribution of lesions are the interdigital web spaces, flexor surfaces of the wrists, the elbows, the axillae, the buttocks and genitalia, and on the breasts of women. Other skin changes are secondary to pruritus and include excoriation and lichenification.\\nCiguatera is a cause of localized pruritic neurosensory manifestations (perioral and distal extremity paresthesias) without cutaneous manifestations. There should be a history of fish consumption, other cases among travelers sharing the  same  meal,  a  short  incubation  period\\n(2-30 hours), and the association of gastrointestinal and neurological signs. The latter can last for months after the initial event. This fish poisoning is acquired by the ingestion of fish containing the toxins produced by the dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus toxicus , which is found in damaged coral reef systems in tropical and subtropical regions.\\nSeabather's eruption (also called sea lice) is a highly pruritic maculopapular  eruption  that  occurs  after  swimming  in  the  ocean  and  is generally confined to the skin under swimwear. It is caused by larval forms of sea  anemones  (e.g. Edwardsiella  lineata )  and  jellyfish  (e.g. Linuche unguiculata ) that become trapped under swimwear.\\nCercarial dermatitis (swimmer's itch) is also a pruritic maculopapular eruption but is predominantly distributed on uncovered body areas. It  results  from  penetration  of  the  skin  by  cercariae  of  nonhuman schistosomes while swimming in fresh water. It can last for several days.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

The initial diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis was confirmed by an AFB-positive fine-needle aspirate from a neck gland. The paradoxical IRIS was diagnosed clinically based on his worsening condition after starting ART, despite evidence of a good virologic and immunologic response. The superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis, likely with Staphylococcus aureus, was confirmed by the second aspirate showing purulent material with coccoid bacteria and the patient's rapid improvement following incision, drainage, and antibiotics.\\nVitals: On presentation, he was febrile with a temperature of 39.2 °C (102.56° F).

The clinical picture of progressive respiratory failure in an ART-naïve HIV-positive patient with a low CD4 count (150/μL), along with characteristic ground-glass infiltrates on CT imaging and a highly elevated serum β-glucan, strongly supported the diagnosis.\\nVitals: On admission, he was febrile with a temperature of 39.2 °C (102.6 °F). His blood pressure was 120/70 mmHg, pulse was 100 bpm, and respiratory rate was 26 breaths per minute. He was hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 87% on room air, which improved to 97% on 15L of oxygen.\\nContent: The patient presented with a 6-week history of progressively worsening shortness of breath, a dry cough, and drenching night sweats.

The diagnosis was made clinically based on the characteristic widespread dark-purplish plaques on the skin and palate. Pulmonary KS was strongly suspected given his chronic respiratory symptoms, exam findings, and typical chest radiograph changes, in the context of a low CD4 count (134 cells/μL). Tuberculosis, a key differential, was reasonably excluded by negative sputum and GeneXpert testing.\\nVitals: The patient's temperature was 36 °C (96.8 °F), respiratory rate was 32 breaths per minute, and pulse was 102 bpm. He appeared comfortable at rest.\\nContent: The patient presented with a one-month history of dark spots on his arm and leg, which were progressing, accompanied by new facial swelling. He also reported a three-month history of a cough productive of white sputum and worsening shortness of breath.

This diagnosis is supported by the patient's presentation with chronic undulating fever, severe malnutrition, splenomegaly, generalized lymphadenopathy, and pancytopenia. Epidemiological risk was high, as she was from a known endemic area with a family history of the disease.

Acute infectious  diarrhea  can  be  classified  into  watery  diarrhea  and  bloody diarrhea (dysentery) (Box 3.1).

Toxin-induced  secretory  diarrhea  continues  independent  of  food intake. Malabsorption of carbohydrate in the small intestine leads to fermentation of unabsorbed substrates by colonic bacteria; this may cause bloating, the passage of much rectal gas and frothy stools, which are all characteristic of giardiasis. Cryptosporidiosis can involve both small and large bowel, causing short-lived and self-limiting diarrhea; however, the infection can be prolonged in patients with impaired immune responses. Cyclospora cayetanensis can also cause  acute and more chronic diarrhea with abnormalities of intestinal absorption.\\nFrequent  bowel  movements  with  small  volumes  of  stool  and  the passage  of  blood  and  mucus  suggest  colonic  infection.  Causes  of bloody diarrhea (dysentery) include invasive bacteria such as Campylobacter spp., enterohemorrhagic E. coli , and Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia spp.; nonbacterial causes include Entamoeba histolytica (amebic dysentery) and Balantidium coli , which is spread by close contact with pigs. Colicky abdominal pain is common in many gut infections and is especially severe in campylobacteriosis and yersiniosis, mimicking acute appendicitis. Fever, chills and generalized myalgia are usually associated with infection by invasive organisms; these patients appear ill and have generalized abdominal tenderness.\\n---\\n[SYMPTOMS]\\nContent: Intense gastrointestinal symptoms  will  follow ingestion within 30 min  to  a  few  hours.  Diarrhea  may  sometimes  become  bloody. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance may follow and, in severe cases, renal dysfunction  might  ensue.  Occasionally,  cholinergic  symptoms  are observed.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Intestinal capillariasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is intestinal capillariasis caused by the nematode Capillaria philippinensis. The diagnosis was established based on the patient's clinical presentation of severe chronic diarrhoea, profound malabsorption with weight loss and oedema, and electrolyte abnormalities. Definitive confirmation was made by the identification of characteristic peanut-shaped ova on stool microscopy. The patient's residence in an endemic region and her positive clinical response to albendazole therapy further substantiated the diagnosis.\\nVitals: On presentation, the patient was afebrile, with a heart rate of 100 bpm and blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg.\\nContent: Symptoms began two months prior with stomach rumbles and colicky abdominal pain, which later progressed to anorexia and vomiting. The patient developed voluminous diarrhoea, occurring five to ten times in 24 hours, both during the day and at night, and unrelated to meals. She had been treated with various antibiotics, including metronidazole, and antidiarrhoeal drugs without any improvement. Over the last month, she developed lower limb swelling and severe prostration.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Giardiasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is giardiasis, caused by the protozoan parasite Giardia intestinalis.

Lately \\nI’ve also noticed eye pain, blurry vision, and little floaters moving around in my vision. I do have a cat at home and I sometimes handle \\nthe litter box. Could this be related to an infection?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS]\\nContent: Typically, the disease begins with the abrupt onset of intense headache, fever, chills, and myalgia. Fever often exceeds 40°C (103°F) and is preceded by rigors. Muscle pain can be excruciating and occurs most commonly in the thighs, calves, lumbosacral region, and abdomen. Abdominal  wall  pain  accompanied  by  palpation  tenderness  can mimic an acute surgical abdomen. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and sore throat are other frequent symptoms. Cough and chest pain figure prominently in reports of patients from Korea and China.\\nConjunctival suffusion is a helpful diagnostic clue that usually appears two  or  three  days  after  the  onset  of  fever  and  involves  the  bulbar conjunctiva.  Pus  and  serous  secretions  are  absent  and  there  is  no matting  of  the  eyelashes  and  eyelids.  Mild  suffusion  can  easily  be overlooked. Less common and less distinctive signs include pharyngeal injection, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and skin  lesions.  Within  a  week,  most  patients  become  asymptomatic. After several days of apparent recovery, the illness resumes in some individuals. Manifestations of the second stage are more variable and mild than those of the initial illness and usually last 2-4 days. Leptospires  disappear  from  the  blood,  cerebrospinal  fluid  (CSF),  and tissues, but appear in the urine. Serum antibody titers rise - hence the term  'immune'  phase.  Meningitis  is  the  hallmark  of  this  stage  of leptospirosis. Pleocytosis of the CSF can be demonstrated in 80-90% of all patients during the second week of illness, although only about 50% will have clinical signs and symptoms of meningitis. Meningeal signs can last several weeks, but usually resolve within a day or two. Uveitis  is  a  late  manifestation  of  leptospirosis,  generally  seen  4-8 months after the illness has begun. The anterior uveal tract is most frequently affected and pain, photophobia, and blurring of vision are the usual symptoms.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Most patients with VEE have a history of exposure to mosquitoes in regions  of  humid  tropical  forests  or  have  been  present  during  an equine epizootic  [2]. Following  an  incubation  period  of  1-5  days, chills, headache, fever, body aches and prostration begin abruptly [3]. Asthenia,  dizziness  and  acute  discomfort  are  incapacitating.  Lumbosacral pain is common, along with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and a sore throat. After defervescence, a dull headache and weakness may persist for several days; fever and symptoms occasionally recrudesce. Although signs of mild neurologic involvement are common, only about 4% of infected children progress to frank neurologic disease; adults rarely do. Signs include nuchal rigidity, stupor, coma, delirium, seizures, cranial nerve palsies, motor weakness, paralysis, nystagmus, pathologic reflexes and spastic paralysis. Elevated intracranial pressure and  meningismus  occur  in  most  childhood  cases.  Approximately 0.5% of all symptomatic cases are fatal, nearly all in children. However, many survivors of neurologic disease experience sequelae, including memory problems, nervousness, asthenia, recurrent seizures, motor impairment, psychomotor retardation and behavioral disorders.\\nEastern  equine  encephalitis  typically  begins  after  3-10  days  of incubation with the sudden onset of headache, fever, chills, photophobia, dysethesias, myalgia, malaise and vomiting [1, 2, 4]. In infants, encephalitis caused by eastern equine encephalitis virus is characterized  by  abrupt  onset,  but  in  older  children  and  adults  is manifested after a few days of systemic illness. Patients may recover or  can  progress to more severe neurologic illness beginning with a worsening headache, dizziness, vomiting, lethargy and progressing to neck  stiffness,  confusion  and  convulsions.  Severe  cases  requiring hospitalization may involve seizures, disorientation and coma. The course of illness may be rapid in infants; infants are most likely to suffer neurologic sequelae,  such  as  motor  weakness, paralysis, aphasia, mental retardation and seizures. Many patients with permanent sequelae die a few years later.\\n---\\n[MILD ILLNESS]\\nContent: Enteric fever is usually insidious. Fever may gradually increase over the first week of illness. Headache, anorexia, malaise, and other nonspecific,  flu-like  symptoms  are  common  and  may  precede  fever. Abdominal complaints  including  diarrhea,  constipation,  and  nonlocalizing abdominal pain each occur in less than a third of cases, but may raise clinical suspicion [16].\\nPhysical findings are also nonspecific. Relative bradycardia, or pulsetemperature dissociation, is considered a classic sign of enteric fever, but there is no widely accepted definition of relative bradycardia and little evidence that it is a useful predictor [17]. Rose spots are small, blanching pink macular lesions, typically 2-4 mm, that usually occur on the chest, abdomen and/or back during the second week of illness, but are infrequently observed. A white, yellow or brown coating of the tongue that spares the tongue's edges is common. Mild abdominal tenderness may be present. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, if present, are usually modest.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Stevens-Johnson syndrome\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), a severe drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction. This clinical diagnosis is based on the patient's generalized maculopapular rash with extensive mucous membrane involvement (oral, conjunctival, genital), which appeared approximately four weeks after starting nevirapine and co-trimoxazole, both of which are highly implicated drugs. The diagnosis is further supported by the much higher incidence of SJS in HIV-positive individuals. Infectious causes like malaria were ruled out with negative testing.\\nVitals: Temperature is 37.7°C (99.9°F), blood pressure is 120/68 mmHg, pulse is 90 bpm, and respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute.\\nContent: The patient developed a productive cough with whitish sputum, followed one day later by a generalized skin rash that started on her trunk and spread to the extremities and mucosal membranes. Over the past two days, she also developed a sore throat and dysuria. The rash involves her lips, oral mucosa, conjunctivae, and genital mucosa, and has made talking and eating difficult and painful.\\n---\\n[OPHTHALMIC CYSTICERCOSIS]\\nContent: Cysticerci  infecting  the  eye  are  retinal  or  subretinal,  but  may  float freely in the vitreous or aqueous humors (see Fig. 127.2).

This was established based on the patient\\'s clinical presentation of fever, abdominal pain, and weight loss, combined with profound eosinophilia, multiple non-enhancing liver lesions on CT scan, and a key exposure history of consuming watercress in the Peruvian Andes. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by a positive Fas2 ELISA serology and a rapid, complete response to a single dose of triclabendazole.\\nVitals: On admission, her blood pressure was 95/60 mmHg, pulse was 105 bpm, and temperature was 38.5°C (101.3°F).\\nContent: The patient is from the Peruvian Andes. Approximately two to three months prior to her illness, she changed to a vegetarian diet and began consuming energetic hot drinks made from alfalfa and watercress. No other specific exposures or sick contacts were reported.\\n---\\n[EXPOSURE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY]\\nDisease: Angiostrongyliasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is eosinophilic meningitis caused by Angiostrongylus cantonensis (rat lungworm). This was established based on the clinical presentation of severe headache following consumption of potential intermediate hosts (snails, frogs) in an endemic area (north-east Thailand), a co-case in a family member, marked peripheral and CSF eosinophilia, and was definitively confirmed by a positive Western Blot showing specific antibodies against the 31kD A. cantonensis antigen.\\nVitals: On examination, the patient was afebrile. During a lumbar puncture, the initial cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure was elevated at 34 cm H2O.\\nContent: The patient had returned 10 days prior from a 4-week trip to north-east Thailand. During her visit, she consumed traditional regional dishes, including freshwater fish, seafood, snails, and frogs. She reported that her brother-in-law, with whom she had shared several meals, also developed a severe headache.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Giardiasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is giardiasis, caused by the protozoan parasite Giardia intestinalis. This was confirmed by direct microscopic identification of Giardia trophozoites and cysts in stool samples. The clinical presentation of greasy, foul-smelling stools, bloating, and evidence of carbohydrate malabsorption (positive reducing substances in stool) is classic for this infection.\\nVitals: The patient has no fever; no other vital signs are reported.\\nContent: For the past two weeks, the patient has experienced four to five episodes of loose stools per day, accompanied by weight loss, anorexia, malaise, flatulence, and abdominal cramping during defecation. For the last three days, he has noted bloating and distension after consuming milk products. While he has mild nausea, he reports no fever. His stools were initially watery, but after a 5-day course of ciprofloxacin from a local pharmacy (which ended two days ago), they are now three to four per day and described as mushy, greasy, and foul-smelling.\\n---\\n[SCURVY AND VITAMIN C =ASCORBIC ACID>]\\nContent: Scurvy is caused by vitamin C deficiency [22]. Humans, unlike most animals, cannot synthesize vitamin C and it is an essential vitamin obtained  primarily  from  fresh  fruit  and  vegetables,  such  as  watercress. Scurvy can develop a month after vitamin C is removed from the diet, although three months or more is more typical. Ascorbate (the active form) promotes hydroxylation of proline and lysine after their  incorporation into collagen, and the manifestations of  scurvy are primarily related to impaired connective tissue synthesis. Nondescript weakness and fatigue are followed by follicular hyperkeratosis and cutaneous petechial or ecchymotic bleeding after minor trauma. Bleeding from the oral mucosa and spongy enlargement of the gums are  common;  classically,  the  gingival  interdental  papillae  between the  teeth  are  bright  red.  Disease  progression  leads  to  depression, profound weakness, an inability of wounds to heal, the loss of all teeth,  jaundice  and  neuropathy,  before  death.  In  infants  and  children,  scurvy  is  manifested  by  tenderness  of  the  bones,  linked  to subperiosteal hemorrhage, such that they cry when their bones are touched.  Crawling  and  standing  are  avoided  because  of  the  pain. Bleeding at the osteochondral rib junctions may mimic the ricketic \\'rosary\\' of vitamin D or calcium deficiency [23]. Anemia can also be seen because of blood loss and because ascorbate promotes intestinal iron absorption.\\nEndemic scurvy no longer exists in high-income countries but persists elsewhere [24]. Scurvy occurs in those who ingest grains but not fruit [25];  in  socially  isolated  persons,  prisoners  [26]  or  alcoholics  with poor diets; and in persons with inflammatory bowel disease. Breast milk  contains  vitamin  C  and  scurvy  may  occur  in  the  infants  of vitamin C-deficient mothers. Infants and children fed grains, but not fruit, vegetables or fresh animal protein, are also at risk. Because heat destroys vitamin C, it is added to milk after pasteurization. Curing and drying fresh meat destroys the vitamin C it contains. This, and the lack of fresh vegetables or fruit, accounted for the high incidence of  scurvy  in  sailors  whom,  historically,  often  lived  solely  on  dried grains, dried vegetables, such as beans, and dried meat.\\n---\\n[EXPOSURE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY]\\nDisease: Cerebral sparganosis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is cerebral sparganosis, caused by the larva of the tapeworm *Spirometra mansoni*. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by the surgical removal and direct visualization of a live sparganum from the brain lesion in the left occipital lobe. The diagnosis was further supported by strongly positive ELISA serology for *Spirometra mansoni* in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid, as well as the characteristic \"tunnel sign\" on MRI.\\nVitals: On admission, the patient was afebrile. No other vital signs were reported.\\nContent: The patient resides in Japan, an endemic area for sparganosis. The suspected route of infection was through consumption of raw chicken meat, which he reportedly ate approximately once a month before the onset of his seizure.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.'},\n",

A few days ago I even \\nnoticed a thin, worm-like thing in my stool. Earlier this month I was traveling in a tropical area where I ate some fruits and vegetables that \\nprobably weren’t washed well. Could this be caused by something I ate?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[EPIDEMIOLOGY]\\nContent: The  differential  diagnosis,  at  the  beginning  of  the  illness,  would include pathogenic enteric bacteria or viruses. However, as the illness progresses, the differential would include other intestinal protozoa, including Giardia lamblia .  A  rare  cause  of  illness  in  travelers, Cystoisospora  belli ,  can  produce  a  prolonged  diarrhea  after  travel,  and  is sensitive to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Fatigue and weight loss can be caused by Entamoeba histolytica , but anorexia is not as prominent. Dientamoeba fragilis can cause prolonged, low-grade intestinal symptoms, but without anorexia or weight loss. Fatigue and weight loss can be due to tropical sprue, which is a rare cause of prolonged diarrhea  in  travelers.  Celiac  sprue  occasionally  manifests  during foreign travel.\\n---\\n[INTESTINAL OR ENTERAL PHASE]\\nContent: The initial consequences of infection occur within the first week after ingestion of larval worms in inadequately cooked meat (Table 1 15-2). The symptoms, reflecting mucosal irritation as adult worms develop in  the  small  intestine,  include  nausea,  abdominal  cramps,  loss  of appetite, vomiting, low-grade fever, and either mild diarrhea or constipation. Frontal headaches, dizziness, and weakness can also occur, especially in light to moderate infections. Severe diarrhea, persisting for weeks, can be seen in heavy infections. Infected Inuit Indians in North America experience an unusually high frequency of diarrhea and a low frequency of myalgia. This may reflect chronic exposure and the development of intestinal immunity [4].\\n---\\n[ASSESSMENT]\\nContent: The goals in assessing patients are to:\\n- determine if there is a persisting, treatable infection-often giardiasis or another protozoal infection;\\n- consider the possibility of gastrointestinal disease, such as celiac disease, brought to light as a consequence of intestinal infection, or IBD presenting for the first time;\\n- consider whether the patient has a disease unrelated to travel.\\nIf, after careful evaluation, an infectious cause is ruled out and there is no underlying non-infectious bowel disease, the patient is likely to have post-infectious IBS. In this case, managing persisting symptoms becomes the main objective.\\nWeight  loss  during  tropical  travels  is  common,  but  this  is  usually regained when the traveler returns to their usual diet. When this does not happen, malabsorption needs to be considered in a patient with continuing diarrhea. Pale, foul-smelling stools are typical of malabsorption. Both foul-smelling flatus and stools are typical of giardiasis. Soreness of tongue or mouth can be associated with folate deficiency, consistent with celiac disease and tropical sprue, but uncommon in giardiasis.  Tropical  sprue  is  now  uncommon  in  travellers,  perhaps related  to  the ready  use  of antibiotics  in  the treatment of travelers' diarrhea.\\nPhysical  examination  should  assess  for  abdominal  masses,  colonic tenderness,  and  organ  enlargement.  Signs  of  advanced  nutrient depletion such as glossitis, anemia, and ankle edema suggesting hypoproteinemia,  are  unusual.  It  is  essential  to  record  body  weight  at initial evaluation so that changes over time and after treatment can be monitored.\\nA history of blood in the stools needs careful evaluation. The cause may be as simple as an anal fissure from frequent bowel movements and irritation at the mucocutaneous junction, or bleeding from hemorrhoids. In these cases, small amounts of fresh blood are seen on the outside of the stool or left on the toilet paper after a bowel movement. Blood can be associated with invasive organisms, shiga-toxin producing E. coli [9], and non-infectious etiologies (Table 146-1). Colonoscopy may be is often needed to investigate non-local causes.\\n---\\n[STEPHEN G WRIGHT]\\nContent: frequently identified agent and travel to South Asia, the highest risk [6]. Although parasites are considered more common with chronic disease, bacterial diarrhea can also persist beyond a week [8].\\nWhile Giardia is the commonest parasitic cause of persisting diarrhea, Cryptosporidium spp. and, less  commonly, Cyclospora cayetanensis are also  recognized.  Amebiasis  is  uncommon  in  short-term  travelers, being  typically  seen  in  long-term  travelers  or  expatriates.  Intestinal helminths usually do not cause diarrheal symptoms with low worm burdens. Acute hookworm infection can occasionally be associated\\nTABLE 146-1 Causes of Persistent Diarrhea in Returned Travelers*\\n\\nDiarrhea with weight loss, Possible causes = Giardiasis Cryptosporidosis Cyclospora Hookworm infection (uncommon) Whipworm infection Strongyloidiasis (less common with GI symptoms) Celiac disease (gluten sensitive enteropathy) HIV/AIDS Tropical sprue (rare) In=ammatory bowel disease Colonic cancer Pancreatic disease Anatomical causes (diverticula, strictures, blind loops).

Dizziness and headaches are sometime so sudden that soldiers have been known to fall over in the trenches. Other symptoms include post-orbital  pain  (typically  exacerbated by movement), pain in  the lower limbs and back, constipation, a rash on the face, and a loss of appetite [12].

Although trench fever often results in prolonged disability, it is rarely fatal.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Most patients with VEE have a history of exposure to mosquitoes in regions  of  humid  tropical  forests  or  have  been  present  during  an equine epizootic  [2]. Following  an  incubation  period  of  1-5  days, chills, headache, fever, body aches and prostration begin abruptly [3]. Asthenia,  dizziness  and  acute  discomfort  are  incapacitating.  Lumbosacral pain is common, along with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and a sore throat. After defervescence, a dull headache and weakness may persist for several days; fever and symptoms occasionally recrudesce. Although signs of mild neurologic involvement are common, only about 4% of infected children progress to frank neurologic disease; adults rarely do. Signs include nuchal rigidity, stupor, coma, delirium, seizures, cranial nerve palsies, motor weakness, paralysis, nystagmus, pathologic reflexes and spastic paralysis. Elevated intracranial pressure and  meningismus  occur  in  most  childhood  cases.  Approximately 0.5% of all symptomatic cases are fatal, nearly all in children. However, many survivors of neurologic disease experience sequelae, including memory problems, nervousness, asthenia, recurrent seizures, motor impairment, psychomotor retardation and behavioral disorders.\\nEastern  equine  encephalitis  typically  begins  after  3-10  days  of incubation with the sudden onset of headache, fever, chills, photophobia, dysethesias, myalgia, malaise and vomiting [1, 2, 4]. In infants, encephalitis caused by eastern equine encephalitis virus is characterized  by  abrupt  onset,  but  in  older  children  and  adults  is manifested after a few days of systemic illness. Patients may recover or  can  progress to more severe neurologic illness beginning with a worsening headache, dizziness, vomiting, lethargy and progressing to neck  stiffness,  confusion  and  convulsions.  Severe  cases  requiring hospitalization may involve seizures, disorientation and coma. The course of illness may be rapid in infants; infants are most likely to suffer neurologic sequelae,  such  as  motor  weakness, paralysis, aphasia, mental retardation and seizures. Many patients with permanent sequelae die a few years later.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Mayaro fever\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was Mayaro fever, caused by Mayaro virus (MAYV). This was confirmed by serological testing showing a positive Mayaro IgM-IFA (1280 on 29 August, 40 on 12 September) and IgG-IFA (2560 on both dates) with a confirmatory plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) that rose from 40 to 160. The diagnosis aligns with the patient's travel history to the Amazon Basin, the preceding dengue-like febrile illness, and the characteristic prolonged symmetrical polyarthralgias primarily affecting small peripheral joints, while other common travel-related viral and bacterial causes were ruled out by serology.\\nVitals: No specific vital signs were reported other than the occurrence of an acute febrile illness with chills.\\nContent: During the second week of a 3.5-week trip to the Amazon Basin of northern Peru, the patient developed an acute febrile illness with chills, malaise, frontal headache, generalized myalgia, and a transient, non-pruritic maculopapular rash. The rash began on the forearms about 1 week after fever onset, spread to the trunk, neck, and face, and faded after 3 days. Slowly progressive, debilitating polyarthralgias affecting peripheral joints, with transient joint swelling, also developed. Painful cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy lasted for about 1 week. Fever and other acute symptoms subsided within 1 week, but polyarthralgias persisted, showing a symmetrical pattern mainly affecting the small joints of the hands and feet, wrists, ankles, and knees. Upon return to Switzerland a few weeks later, the patient reported stiffness of the affected joints, mainly in the morning and after immobility, and the joint pains did not improve for two more months.\\n---\\n[FEBRILE ILLNESSES]\\nContent: Priority  should  be  given  to  identifying  illnesses  that  can  be  fatal rapidly or pose a threat to public health. Delayed diagnosis of Plasmodium  falciparum malaria  can  be  lethal,  and  undiagnosed  TB  or measles can lead to secondary cases.\\nFever  soon  after  immigration  from  malarial  countries  could  be malaria; 90% of P. falciparum cases occur within 1 month of arrival. Fever with rash suggests dengue, while fever with rash and arthritis may  indicate  chikungunya  virus.  Early  fevers  may  also  be  due  to typhoid  and  paratyphoid  fevers,  rickettsial  infections,  and  amebic liver abscesses. Fever months after migration may be caused by TB, primary malarial infection, or relapse of P. vivax and P.  ovale. Many less  common infections can be associated with fever, though other accompanying  signs  and  symptoms  may  suggest  these  diagnoses. Other febrile illness with short incubation periods, such as influenza or meningococcemia, can occur in immigrants exposed after migration, but may be more relevant to returning travelers [8]. This chapter will focus on infectious diseases that can be seen by clinicians at any time following migration and that are likely to be related to the individual's country of origin or migration process.\\n---\\n[CHIEF COMPLAINT]\\nDisease: Falciparum malaria\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is Plasmodium falciparum malaria with clinical treatment failure. The initial diagnosis was confirmed by a positive slide prior to admission and a positive HRP-2 RDT on admission. The treatment failure was not due to drug resistance but to the administration of a substandard antimalarial drug (intramuscular artemether) that contained significantly less active ingredient than stated. This was confirmed by the patient's rapid clinical response to a standard-of-care regimen of quinine and doxycycline and subsequent laboratory analysis of the drug vial.\\nVitals: On admission, he was febrile with a temperature of 39.5 °C (103.1 °F).

During a lumbar puncture, the initial cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure was elevated at 34 cm H2O.\\nContent: The patient presented with a severe headache of gradual onset for the past 8 days that did not respond to any painkillers. She reported no fever or chills, and denied any visual problems, limb weakness, or memory problems. A CT scan of her brain performed at a different hospital three days prior to presentation was reported as normal.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Most patients with VEE have a history of exposure to mosquitoes in regions  of  humid  tropical  forests  or  have  been  present  during  an equine epizootic  [2]. Following  an  incubation  period  of  1-5  days, chills, headache, fever, body aches and prostration begin abruptly [3]. Asthenia,  dizziness  and  acute  discomfort  are  incapacitating.  Lumbosacral pain is common, along with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and a sore throat. After defervescence, a dull headache and weakness may persist for several days; fever and symptoms occasionally recrudesce. Although signs of mild neurologic involvement are common, only about 4% of infected children progress to frank neurologic disease; adults rarely do. Signs include nuchal rigidity, stupor, coma, delirium, seizures, cranial nerve palsies, motor weakness, paralysis, nystagmus, pathologic reflexes and spastic paralysis. Elevated intracranial pressure and  meningismus  occur  in  most  childhood  cases.  Approximately 0.5% of all symptomatic cases are fatal, nearly all in children. However, many survivors of neurologic disease experience sequelae, including memory problems, nervousness, asthenia, recurrent seizures, motor impairment, psychomotor retardation and behavioral disorders.\\nEastern  equine  encephalitis  typically  begins  after  3-10  days  of incubation with the sudden onset of headache, fever, chills, photophobia, dysethesias, myalgia, malaise and vomiting [1, 2, 4]. In infants, encephalitis caused by eastern equine encephalitis virus is characterized  by  abrupt  onset,  but  in  older  children  and  adults  is manifested after a few days of systemic illness. Patients may recover or  can  progress to more severe neurologic illness beginning with a worsening headache, dizziness, vomiting, lethargy and progressing to neck  stiffness,  confusion  and  convulsions.  Severe  cases  requiring hospitalization may involve seizures, disorientation and coma. The course of illness may be rapid in infants; infants are most likely to suffer neurologic sequelae,  such  as  motor  weakness, paralysis, aphasia, mental retardation and seizures. Many patients with permanent sequelae die a few years later.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

The time from infection to clinical disease is approximately 10 days to the onset of fever and 14 days to the onset of rash. Persons with measles are infectious for several days before and after the onset of rash, when levels of measles virus in blood and body fluids are highest and when the symptoms of cough, coryza and sneezing are most severe. The host immune response at sites of virus replication is responsible for the signs and symptoms of measles.\\nFIGURE 28.1.1 Reported measles cases with date of  onset  between  July  2010  and  January  2011 (redrawn  from  World  Health  Organization.

Physical examination should focus on the clinical features of measles, specifically Koplik's spots and rash, as well as potential sites of secondary  infections,  including pneumonia  and  otitis media. Appropriate precautions need to be taken to prevent transmission within healthcare settings.\\nMeasles is readily diagnosed on clinical grounds by clinicians familiar with  the  disease,  particularly  during  outbreaks.  Koplik's  spots  are especially helpful as they appear before the rash and are pathognomonic  (Fig.  28.1.4).  Clinical  diagnosis  is  more  difficult  in  regions where  the  incidence  of  measles  is  low,  as  other  pathogens  are\\nB\\nFIGURE  28.1.5 Measles  rash.

The World Health Organization (WHO) clinical case definition for measles consists of any person with fever and maculopapular rash  (i.e.  non-vesicular),  and  cough,  coryza  or  conjunctivitis  [13]. Although this is not very specific, it is devised primarily for outbreak control and monitoring, rather than clinical use.\\nThe detection of measles virus-specific IgM in a single specimen of serum or oral fluid is considered diagnostic of acute infection and is the most common method of laboratory confirmation (Fig. 28.1.7) [14]. IgM antibodies may not be detectable until four days or more after  rash  onset  and  usually  fall  to  undetectable  levels  within  4-8 weeks of rash onset. Alternatively, acute infection can be confirmed with a fourfold, or greater, increase in measles virus-specific IgG antibody levels between acute and convalescent sera. The presence of IgG antibodies in a single serum specimen is evidence of prior infection\\n---\\n[VIRAL INFECTIONS WITH CUTANEOUS LESIONS]\\nContent: 28\\nrecently, progress has been made in sub-Saharan Africa as a consequence of increasing routine measles vaccine coverage and provision of  a  second  opportunity  for  measles  vaccination  through  mass measles vaccination campaigns [2].\\n- Highly contagious mucocutaneous disease caused by measles virus\\n- One of the most important infectious diseases of humans, responsible for millions of deaths prior to the development of measles vaccines\\n- Prodromal illness characterized by fever, cough, coryza and conjunctivitis\\n- Koplik's spots, small white lesions on the buccal mucosa, appear before the rash\\n- Characteristic erythematous and maculopapular rash appears ?rst on the face and behind the ears and then spreads to the trunk and extremities\\n- Widespread use of measles vaccines has resulted in dramatic declines in incidence and mortality\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Clinically, features  begin  with  a  prodromal  illness  characterized  by fever,  cough,  coryza  and  conjunctivitis  (Fig.  28.1.3).  Koplik's  spots (small white lesions on the buccal mucosa) may be visible during the prodrome and allow the astute clinician to diagnose measles prior to the onset of rash (Fig. 28.1.4). The prodromal symptoms intensify several days before the onset of rash. A characteristic erythematous and maculopapular rash appears, first on the face and behind the ears, and then spreads, in a centrifugal fashion, to the trunk and extremities (Fig. 28.1.5). The rash lasts for 3-4 days and fades in the same manner as  it  appeared.  Malnourished  children  may  develop  a  deeply  pigmented rash that desquamates or peels during recovery [8].\\nIn uncomplicated measles, clinical recovery begins soon after appearance of the rash. Complications can occur in up to 40% of measles cases; the risk  of complication is increased by extremes of age and malnutrition (Fig. 28.1.6).

Pneumonia  is  caused  by  secondary  viral  or bacterial infections, or  by the measles virus itself. Other respiratory complications  include  laryngotracheobronchitis  (croup)  and  otitis media. Mouth ulcers, or stomatitis, may hinder children from eating or  drinking.  Many  children  with  measles  develop  diarrhea,  which further contributes to malnutrition.

       "    'content': \"PATIENT QUESTION:\\nI got a cut a little over a week ago while working outdoors, and lately my jaw has been getting really stiff. Now I’m having trouble swallowing, \\nmy neck feels tight, and I’m getting these painful muscle spasms that come out of nowhere when I hear a loud noise or someone touches me. \\nI don’t remember when I last got a tetanus shot. What could be happening?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Tetanus can produce a spectrum of clinical features depending on the site  of  infection  and  the  amount  of  toxin  produced.  In  its  mildest form, isolated areas of the body are affected and only local muscle spasm may be apparent. In such cases, outcome is usually good, with the  important  exception  of  cephalic  tetanus.  In  this  condition,  the cranial nerves are involved and phargyngeal or laryngeal muscles may spasm,  leading  to  sudden  aspiration  or  airway  obstruction.  These patients require careful observation.\\nGeneralized muscle spasm is the most typical feature of tetanus. The muscles  of  the  face  and  jaw  are  often  affected  first,  producing  the characteristic  'risus  sardonicus'  and  trismus  (lockjaw)  [3].  Many patients also experience difficulty swallowing, back pain, and generalized muscle pain and stiffness. Neonates typically present with difficulty in feeding. As the disease progresses, generalized muscle spasms develop, which can be very painful. Commonly, the laryngeal muscles are  involved  early,  which  can  be  life-threatening  as  it  may  lead  to sudden and complete airway obstruction. Spasm  of the respiratory muscles results in respiratory failure and, without mechanical ventilation,  is  the  commonest  cause  of  death.  Spasms  strong  enough  to produce tendon avulsions and crush fractures have been reported, but are rare.\\nAutonomic disturbance is maximal during the second week of the illness and can be fatal. Blood pressure, heart rate and temperature can fluctuate wildly, and can be associated with gastrointestinal stasis, sweating and increased secretions.\\nRapid development of tetanus is associated with more severe disease and poor outcome. The incubation period (time from wound to first symptom) and period of onset (time from first symptom to the first generalized spasm) are of particular significance, with shorter times associated  with  worse  outcome.  Likewise,  in  neonatal  tetanus,  the younger the infant when symptoms occur, the worse the prognosis (Fig. 55.1).\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Tetanus\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is tetanus. This was established clinically based on the initial presentation of trismus ('stiffness of the mouth') which progressed to generalized muscle spasms and dysphagia. The diagnosis was strongly supported by her epidemiological risk factors, including being an agricultural worker from a country with low vaccination rates. The clinical course, with worsening spasms despite initial treatment, is characteristic of the disease as the toxin continues to affect the nervous system.\\nVitals: On initial presentation, her pulse, blood pressure, and respiratory rate were all within normal limits. No fever was reported.\\nContent: The patient developed difficulty chewing and stiffness of the mouth three days after arriving in Europe from her home in rural Ethiopia. She reported that this symptom had never occurred before. The initial symptom was trismus, which is a common early presentation for tetanus as the muscles of mastication have the shortest motor neurons.\\n---\\n[FINAL DIAGNOSIS]\\nDisease: Tetanus\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is tetanus. This was established clinically based on the initial presentation of trismus ('stiffness of the mouth') which progressed to generalized muscle spasms and dysphagia. The diagnosis was strongly supported by her epidemiological risk factors, including being an agricultural worker from a country with low vaccination rates. The clinical course, with worsening spasms despite initial treatment, is characteristic of the disease as the toxin continues to affect the nervous system.\\nVitals: On initial presentation, her pulse, blood pressure, and respiratory rate were all within normal limits. No fever was reported.\\n---\\n[TREATMENT]\\nContent: The best way to control the severe muscle spasms of tetanus has not been defined by controlled trials. Most authorities, however, use highdose  benzodiazepines  (up  to  100 mg/hour  diazepam  has  been reported) in combination with other drugs, such as chlorpromazine or phenobarbitone [8]. More recently, intravenous magnesium sulfate has been used as a muscle relaxant [9].\\nThe problem with all these treatments is that the doses necessary to control  spasms  also  cause  respiratory  depression,  thus  controlling spasms, while maintaining adequate ventilation is a particular issue in settings without facilities  for  mechanical  ventilation. Respiratory failure is a common cause of death in these circumstances. If mechanical ventilation is available, severe spasms are best dealt with using a combination of benzodiazepines, magnesium, and relatively shortacting, cardiovascularly inert, nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents, as they allow titration against spasm intensity. Infusions of propofol have also been used successfully to control spasms and provide sedation.\\nThe autonomic disturbance of severe tetanus is notoriously difficult to  treat.  A  recent,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  trial  of  intravenous  magnesium  sulfate  (plasma  concentrations  2-4 mmol/l)  for severe tetanus found treatment with magnesium was associated with reduced requirements for benzodiazepines, nondepolarizing muscle relaxants  (pipecuronium),  and  verapamil  (used  for  the  control  of tachycardia)  [10].  In  addition  to  magnesium,  morphine  and  drugs acting specifically on the cardiovascular system (e.g. esmolol, calcium antagonists, and inotropes) may be required.\\nComplications arising  from the treatment of tetanus are common. Ventilator-associated pneumonia, central venous catheter infections, and septicemia are particularly important. In some centers, prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis and thromboembolism is routine.\\nRecovery from tetanus may take 4-6 weeks with prolonged immobility secondary to muscle stiffness. In addition, patients must be given a  full  primary  course  of  immunization,  as  tetanus  toxin  is  poorly immunogenic and does not provoke a protective immune response.\\n---\\n[KEY FEATURES]\\nContent: - Tetanus is a neurologic syndrome characterized by acute skeletal muscle spasm and autonomic nervous system disturbance, caused by a neurotoxin released from Cl o st r i di um  t et ani , a ubiquitous environmental bacterium that can contaminate wounds\\n- Tetanus can be completely prevented by vaccination, yet more than 100,000 people develop tetanus each year, primarily in regions with inadequate vaccination programs\\n- Tetanus is a clinical diagnosis. The cardinal clinical features are muscle spasms, airway obstruction, and (in severe cases) autonomic dysfunction\\n- At diagnosis, the management priorities are to secure the airway, administer antitoxin immune globulins and debride potentially infected wounds\\n- Spasms can be controlled with high-dose benzodiazepines; magnesium sulfate infusions may help control spasms and autonomic dysfunction\\n- Disease does not confer immunity: vaccinate all survivors\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

For the last three days, he has noted bloating and distension after consuming milk products. While he has mild nausea, he reports no fever. His stools were initially watery, but after a 5-day course of ciprofloxacin from a local pharmacy (which ended two days ago), they are now three to four per day and described as mushy, greasy, and foul-smelling.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Cholera\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is cholera, caused by Vibrio cholerae O1, Serotype Ogawa, biotype El Tor. This was established based on the classic clinical syndrome of profuse rice-water diarrhea leading to severe dehydration and shock, combined with a clear epidemiological link to a contaminated water source during an outbreak. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by stool microscopy showing characteristic motile bacilli inhibited by specific antiserum and by positive stool culture for V. cholerae.\\nVitals: On admission, the patient was afebrile with a pulse rate of 110 bpm (low volume) and a blood pressure of 90/50 mmHg. After initial intravenous rehydration, her pulse rate improved to 84 bpm and her blood pressure rose to 100/70 mmHg.\\nContent: The patient developed profuse, large-volume watery diarrhoea, passing 12 to 15 stools in the past day. The stools were described as resembling diluted milk or rice water with white flakes. The illness was notable for the absence of abdominal pain or fever. Approximately one hour prior to presentation, she became unresponsive, prompting her husband to bring her to the hospital.\\n---\\n[INTRODUCTION]\\nContent: Up to 70% of travelers to developing countries report health problems,  the  majority  of  which  are  self-limiting;  however  8-15%  of travelers are ill enough to seek medical attention while abroad or on return home, with fever as a common presenting complaint [1-4]. While  for  many  the  underlying  cause  is  a  self-limiting  globally endemic infection, such as gastroenteritis, physicians are increasingly encountering conditions not normally seen in the patient's country of origin. In some cases these are potentially life-threatening, such as malaria, and others have potential public health consequences, such as enteric fever.\\nTo evaluate returned travelers presenting with fever, an understanding of the geographic distribution of infections, risk factors for acquisition, incubation periods and clinical presentations is required. With this understanding, a risk assessment can be undertaken, initial investigations  instigated,  and,  when  appropriate,  presumptive  therapy started.\\n---\\n[ASSESSMENT]\\nContent: The goals in assessing patients are to:\\n- determine if there is a persisting, treatable infection-often giardiasis or another protozoal infection;\\n- consider the possibility of gastrointestinal disease, such as celiac disease, brought to light as a consequence of intestinal infection, or IBD presenting for the first time;\\n- consider whether the patient has a disease unrelated to travel.\\nIf, after careful evaluation, an infectious cause is ruled out and there is no underlying non-infectious bowel disease, the patient is likely to have post-infectious IBS. In this case, managing persisting symptoms becomes the main objective.\\nWeight  loss  during  tropical  travels  is  common,  but  this  is  usually regained when the traveler returns to their usual diet. When this does not happen, malabsorption needs to be considered in a patient with continuing diarrhea. Pale, foul-smelling stools are typical of malabsorption. Both foul-smelling flatus and stools are typical of giardiasis. Soreness of tongue or mouth can be associated with folate deficiency, consistent with celiac disease and tropical sprue, but uncommon in giardiasis.  Tropical  sprue  is  now  uncommon  in  travellers,  perhaps related  to  the ready  use  of antibiotics  in  the treatment of travelers' diarrhea.\\nPhysical  examination  should  assess  for  abdominal  masses,  colonic tenderness,  and  organ  enlargement.  Signs  of  advanced  nutrient depletion such as glossitis, anemia, and ankle edema suggesting hypoproteinemia,  are  unusual.  It  is  essential  to  record  body  weight  at initial evaluation so that changes over time and after treatment can be monitored.\\nA history of blood in the stools needs careful evaluation. The cause may be as simple as an anal fissure from frequent bowel movements and irritation at the mucocutaneous junction, or bleeding from hemorrhoids. In these cases, small amounts of fresh blood are seen on the outside of the stool or left on the toilet paper after a bowel movement. Blood can be associated with invasive organisms, shiga-toxin producing E. coli [9], and non-infectious etiologies (Table 146-1). Colonoscopy may be is often needed to investigate non-local causes.\\n---\\n[FEVER IN THE RETURNED TRAVELER]\\nContent: Victoria Johnston, Michael Brown example,  gastroenteritis  or  respiratory  tract  infections,  particularly upper respiratory tract infections - are common.

       "    'content': \"PATIENT QUESTION:\\nA patient has a history of possible blood exposure and now presents with long-standing fatigue, easy bruising, dark urine, intermittent \\njaundice, and signs of chronic liver disease such as ascites or confusion. There were few or no symptoms at initial infection. What condition\\nshould be suspected, and what is the underlying cause?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[PATIENT EVALUATION]\\nContent: The  classical  finding  in  acute  viral  hepatitis  is  jaundice,  although patients with milder infections may have bilirubin levels below the 2.0-2.5 mg/dL  in  which  jaundice  is  not  detectable.  Patients  with chronic hepatitis usually do not have jaundice. In both conditions, the patient has other symptoms and signs listed in other sections. The classic laboratory abnormalities of acute hepatitis are elevated serum ALT and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 10-20 times higher than normal. The serum bilirubin is usually elevated, often peaking 10-15times normal. Clinical jaundice is noted when it exceeds 2.5-3.0 mg/ dL.  There  may  be  elevations  in  alkaline  phosphatase,  and  atypical lymphocytes can be noted in the peripheral blood film in the presence of a normal leukocyte count. Bilirubin is often also present in the urine. These laboratory abnormalities can help detect mild and asymptomatic cases [2, 25].\\nDiagnosis of anicteric cases of hepatitis are often based upon obtaining a history of potential exposures to patients with hepatitis or risk factors of infection. The severity of acute viral hepatitis is best measured by the clinical symptoms and serum levels of bilirubin, ALT or AST. The severity of chronic hepatitis is best measured by these same findings and may be supplemented by liver biopsy, ultrasonography and other noninvasive tests of hepatic fibrosis.\\nEach  virus  elicits  a  characteristic  antibody  response.  Detection  of virus-specific IgM class immunoglobulins generally represents acute infection, while IgG antibodies may be present years after resolution of  disease.  Recognition  of  viral  antigens  or  nucleic  acid  represents ongoing infection and correlates with transmissibility.\\n---\\n[APPROACH TO LIVER DISEASE]\\nContent: The evaluation of the liver should determine the site of hepatic injury, the underlying etiology and the severity of the liver disease. Conceptually,  liver  disease  can  be  divided  into:  'pre-hepatic',  involving  the portal  vein  or  hepatic  artery;  'hepatic',  involving  the  parenchymal lobule,  including  hepatocytes,  biliary  and  vascular  sinusoids;  and 'post-hepatic', involving the hepatic vein or biliary systems. Characterizing  liver  abnormalities  may  involve  a  combination  of  clinical, biochemical,  serologic, microbiologic, radiologic and  histologic investigations. These evaluations should be refined by knowledge of the geographic distribution of each condition, and understanding of risk  factors  for  each  disease.  Evaluation  should  include  a  detailed history encompassing a review of symptoms (including right upper quadrant pain or discomfort, anorexia, jaundice, darkened urine, pruritus, fever), underlying conditions, past vaccination history and epidemiologic exposures (including exposures to water, food, blood and animals,  and  sexual  practices).  Examination  should  include  assessment of signs  and  findings  consistent  with  liver  disease,  including jaundice, occurrence of smooth-surfaced white spots or patches under the nails  (leukonychia), palmar erythema, spider nevi and gynecomastia. Hepatomegaly can be associated with most causes of hepatitis and liver lesions, while splenomegaly in the context of liver disease represents  either  portal  hypertension  or  an  underlying  cause,  such as malaria.\\nThe inaccurately termed 'liver function tests' can be used to refine the site of liver disease (Fig. 4.1). Bilirubin is a breakdown product of\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Spinal cord schistosomiasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The patient was diagnosed with spinal cord schistosomiasis complicating an infection with Schistosoma haematobium. The diagnosis was established based on the clinical presentation of a conus syndrome, a clear exposure history of swimming in Lake Malawi, the prior identification of S. haematobium eggs in his urine, significant peripheral eosinophilia, and characteristic MRI findings of a lesion in the conus medullaris and bladder wall thickening. His complete recovery following treatment with praziquantel and corticosteroids further supports the diagnosis.\\nVitals: He has normal vital signs; specific values were not reported.\\nContent: For three weeks, the patient experienced progressive difficulty urinating, requiring increasing abdominal pressure and only being able to pass small amounts at a time, associated with lower abdominal discomfort, abnormal sensations in the groins and genitals, and some erectile dysfunction. He also reports that walking did not feel normal, though he could not specify the abnormality. He denies weakness, dysaesthesia, or loss of sensation in his legs, and has no backache. Over the past two months, he had an unintentional weight loss of 8kg and fatigue without fever or night sweats. One week prior to presentation, he noticed a single episode of reddish urine discoloration without painful micturition or fever, for which he was treated at a local clinic. There is no history of trauma.\\n---\\n[CIRRHOSIS]\\nContent: Ten  to  twenty  percent  of  HCV-infected  patients  develop  cirrhosis over  a  period  of  15-30  years.  Once  cirrhosis  develops,  marked fatigue,  muscle  weakness  and  wasting,  fluid  retention  with  edema and  ascites,  easy  bruising,  dark  urine,  jaundice,  itching  and  upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage can occur. Hepatic failure is more likely in  those  who  have  additional  causes  of  liver  disease,  for  example schistosomiasis, concomitant HBV or HIV, and alcoholic liver disease. Staging of the fibrosis as detected on liver biopsy can predict clinical outcomes, the need for liver transplantation and liver-related death [83].\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Hyperreactive Malarial Splenomegaly\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is Hyperreactive Malarial Splenomegaly (HMS) due to chronic Plasmodium falciparum infection. This was established based on the combination of massive splenomegaly, characteristic bicytopenia, markedly elevated polyclonal IgM, a positive P. falciparum serology (IFAT 1:256), and a positive P. falciparum PCR despite negative blood smears. The diagnosis was further supported by his origin from a malaria-endemic region (rural Mali) and a favorable clinical response to antimalarial therapy, with resolution of fever.\\nVitals: On examination, the patient was afebrile with a temperature of 36.1 °C (96.98 °F). Blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg and pulse was 64 bpm.\\nContent: The patient presented after a haematology work-up for splenomegaly and bicytopenia failed to establish an underlying condition. Clinically, he felt quite well, reporting only intermittent fever and abdominal heaviness. He denied night sweats and reported his weight was stable.

This is supported by the clinical triad of fever and tender hepatomegaly with right intercostal tenderness, imaging findings of a large solitary liver lesion with an elevated hemidiaphragm, and the aspiration of characteristic 'brownish pus'. The diagnosis was further confirmed by the patient's rapid clinical response to metronidazole therapy and the relevant epidemiological risk factor of consuming locally brewed alcohol known to be associated with amoebiasis.\\nVitals: On examination, the patient's temperature was 38.3 °C (100.8 °F), blood pressure was 100/80 mmHg, pulse was 102 bpm, and respiratory rate was 24 breath cycles per minute.\\nContent: For the past week, the patient experienced fever, chills, headache, and body aches, along with severe right-hypochondrial pain. The abdominal pain is described as constant, dull, radiating to the right shoulder, and exacerbated by coughing and resting on the right side. Over the last few days, he also developed a dry cough, has vomited twice, and has lost his appetite.\\n---\\n[GASTROINTESTINAL]\\nContent: Prolonged constipation or dysphagia among immigrants from Latin America  south  of  the  equator  can  indicate  chronic  Chagas  disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi . Infected individuals can have symptoms of achalasia, or evidence of megaesophagus or megacolon. Infection can  be  diagnosed  by  testing  for  IgG  antibodies.  Infection  can  be transmitted  congenitally  and  through  blood  donation;  the  US, Canada, parts of Latin and South America, and parts of Europe routinely test blood donors for infection.\\nJaundice may be associated with hepatitis, schistosomiasis, or the liver fluke Clonorchis  sinensis .  Hepatitis  A  and  B  can  also  present  with abdominal pain, but may be accompanied by fatigue, nausea, and jaundice. Acute hepatitis A is unusual in older immigrants from developing countries because of prior infection.

Infectious etiologies are responsible for the majority of fevers.\\nTuberculosis should be considered in all patients with fever especially if cough, shortness of breath, weight loss, night sweats, or lymphadenopathy are present (see Chapter 39, ' Tuberculosis ') [131]. Other causes of fever are cryptococcal disease (e.g. C. neoformans bloodstream infection),  bacteremia  (e.g. Salmonella , Rhodococcus ),  pneumonia,  both bacterial (e.g. S.  pneumoniae )  and  fungal (e.g. PCP), malaria, CMV, and lymphoma.

The incubation period for most enterovirus infections has not been accurately determined. In the case of poliovirus, the incubation period is typically 3-5 days but may occasionally extend up to 2 weeks. Virus is  shed in the respiratory secretions for 1 week and in the feces for 2-4 weeks or longer. People are most infectious during the incubation period and for the first 2-3 days after the onset of symptoms.

Brainstem  encephalitis caused by enterovirus 71 infection occurs mostly in children under 4 years of age and is associated with a high mortality as a result of a rapid onset neurogenic pulmonary edema and cardiovascular collapse.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Most  enteroviral  infections  are  asymptomatic  or  associated  with  a nonspecific  febrile  illness.  Signs  and  symptoms  of  respiratory  tract infection (coryza, pharyngitis and pneumonia) and herpangina (multiple  oral  ulcers  at  the  back  of  the  oral  cavity)  may  occur,  but  it remains unclear if enteroviruses are a significant cause of vomiting, diarrhea  or  abdominal  pain.  Rare,  serious  clinical  manifestations include  neonatal  sepsis,  meningoencephalitis  and  myopericarditis. Infection with enterovirus 71 can result in pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage and cardiopulmonary failure. Chronic enterovirus infection can occur in persons with defective B-lymphocyte function, including  those  with  X-linked  agammaglobulinemia,  severe  combined immunodeficiency or common variable immunodeficiency.\\nIndividuals with acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis have abrupt onset of eye pain, photophobia and swelling of the eyelids. Fever, headache and  pre-auricular  lymphadenopathy  may  occur.  Subconjunctival hemorrhage is the characteristic clinical manifestation and occurs in the majority of ocular infections caused by enterovirus 70 but is less common with coxsackievirus A24 ocular infection. Signs and symptoms typically peak on the first day of infection and resolve within several days without complications.\\nChildren  with  HFMD  usually  present  with  fever,  sore  throat  and refusal to eat. Physical examination reveals vesicles and ulcers on the buccal mucosa and tongue, and papules and vesicles with surrounding erythema on the hands, feet, wrists, ankles, buttocks and genitalia. HFMD caused by enterovirus 71 and coxsackievirus A16 is usually indistinguishable, although some observers state that the skin lesions associated with coxsackievirus A16 infection are larger and the lesions of enterovirus 71 infection are more commonly papular and petechial [7]. Rarely, HFMD caused by enterovirus 71 may be associated with severe neurologic complications, including aseptic meningitis, brainstem or cerebellar encephalitis, and acute flaccid paralysis (see Chapter 34.2). Permanent paralysis or death can result.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Approximately 80% of human WNV infections are asymptomatic [7]. In clinical infections, the incubation period usually is 2-6 days, but can be up to 21 days in immunocompromised people. Most symptomatic persons experience an acute systemic febrile illness that often includes headache, myalgia or arthralgia; gastrointestinal symptoms and a transient maculopapular rash also are commonly reported. Less than  1%  of  infected  people  develop  neuroinvasive  disease,  which typically manifests as meningitis, encephalitis, or acute flaccid paralysis.  Patients  with  encephalitis  may  present  with  seizures,  mental status changes, focal neurologic deficits or movement disorders.

Typically,  children  with  encephalitis present with a few days history of flu-like illness, usually involving a severe  headache,  and  may  include  coryza,  diarrhea,  and  vomiting. This is followed by a reduction in the level of consciousness, often heralded by a seizure.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Most patients with VEE have a history of exposure to mosquitoes in regions  of  humid  tropical  forests  or  have  been  present  during  an equine epizootic  [2]. Following  an  incubation  period  of  1-5  days, chills, headache, fever, body aches and prostration begin abruptly [3]. Asthenia,  dizziness  and  acute  discomfort  are  incapacitating.  Lumbosacral pain is common, along with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and a sore throat. After defervescence, a dull headache and weakness may persist for several days; fever and symptoms occasionally recrudesce. Although signs of mild neurologic involvement are common, only about 4% of infected children progress to frank neurologic disease; adults rarely do. Signs include nuchal rigidity, stupor, coma, delirium, seizures, cranial nerve palsies, motor weakness, paralysis, nystagmus, pathologic reflexes and spastic paralysis. Elevated intracranial pressure and  meningismus  occur  in  most  childhood  cases.  Approximately 0.5% of all symptomatic cases are fatal, nearly all in children. However, many survivors of neurologic disease experience sequelae, including memory problems, nervousness, asthenia, recurrent seizures, motor impairment, psychomotor retardation and behavioral disorders.\\nEastern  equine  encephalitis  typically  begins  after  3-10  days  of incubation with the sudden onset of headache, fever, chills, photophobia, dysethesias, myalgia, malaise and vomiting [1, 2, 4]. In infants, encephalitis caused by eastern equine encephalitis virus is characterized  by  abrupt  onset,  but  in  older  children  and  adults  is manifested after a few days of systemic illness.

It  may  be  fatal, especially  when  the  brainstem  is  involved  (bulbar  poliomyelitis) (Fig. 34.2.3B).\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: The clinical presentation of all forms of botulism is dominated by neurologic features resulting from the toxin-induced blockade of voluntary motor and autonomic cholinergic junctions.\\nIn adults, cranial nerve palsies are almost always the initial presenting symptoms. Extraocular muscle paresis results in blurred, or double, vision. Marked ptosis is usually evident and pupillary responses may also  be  depressed.  The  face  may  appear  expressionless  as  a  consequence  of  bilateral  facial  nerve  dysfunction.  Involvement  of  lower cranial nerves causes dysphonia, dyarthria and dysphagia. Early autonomic involvement causes anhydrosis leading affected individuals to complain  of  extremely  dry,  and  often  painful,  mouth,  tongue  and throat.\\nDisease progression manifests as a symmetrical, flaccid, descending paralysis of voluntary muscles  associated with  loss of  deep tendon reflexes. Involvement of the diaphragm and accessory thoracic muscles may result in respiratory compromise and death  unless supportive care is provided. Because of the generalized lack of motor function, respiratory failure often occurs without apparent features of respiratory distress and may be overlooked until very advanced. Significant pharyngeal muscle weakness causing airway compromise may necessitate intubation and ventilation, even in the absence of respiratory muscle weakness. Progressive autonomic involvement leads to constipation, urinary retention and hemodynamic dysregulation.\\nFever is usually absent, except in some cases of wound botulism when it probably indicates concurrent wound infection with other bacteria. Sensory nerves are unaffected by botulinum toxin. Similarly, there is no effect  on level  of  consciousness or cognitive function, although the features of expressionless facies and dysarthria are often mistaken for alcohol or drug intoxication.\\nThe extent, severity and rate of progression of clinical features vary, and not all untreated cases progress to respiratory muscle paralysis. Some  affected  individuals  only  develop  cranial  nerve  palsies  that gradually resolve without any other features of botulism becoming evident. Botulinum toxin binding is irreversible, and recovery of function depends on nerve terminal regeneration. Individuals with respiratory  compromise  typically  require  ventilatory  support  for  2-8 weeks, although, occasionally, recovery is much more protracted.\\n---\\n[PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS]\\nContent: asphyxiation.

This is based on the chronic, progressive spastic paraparesis with a thoracic sensory level in a patient from a TB-endemic region who is also HIV-positive. The diagnosis is strongly supported by the spinal radiograph showing collapse of the T11 vertebral body and a paravertebral soft tissue mass, which are characteristic findings. Schistosomiasis was ruled out with negative stool and urine tests, and the insidious onset made acute transverse myelitis less likely.\\nVitals: On a visit three months after symptom onset, his temperature was slightly elevated at 37.5 °C (99.5 °F).

Over the following weeks, he developed difficulty walking and a 'pins and needles' sensation in his legs. Three months after onset, he presented to a health centre with a temperature of 37.5 °C and was given antimalarials and praziquantel. He also consulted a traditional healer. His condition progressively deteriorated over the next six months, eventually leaving him bedridden.

This is supported by the classic clinical presentation of an irreversible, acute-onset spastic paraparesis without sensory or sphincter involvement. The diagnosis is strongly corroborated by the epidemiological context: the patient's diet consisted almost exclusively of grass peas during a famine, he was a young male performing hard physical labor, and other young men in his village were similarly affected. Alternative diagnoses such as other tropical myelopathies were ruled out by the specific clinical features and exposure history.\\nContent: Ten years ago, the patient woke from sleep and noticed weakness in both legs, with no preceding trauma or prodromal symptoms. The weakness progressed rapidly over 4 to 5 days, after which he required a cane for mobility. The condition has been stable since. He reported no back pain, sensory complaints, sphincter disturbance, or upper limb symptoms.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES [4]]\\nContent: Ticks  are  picked  up  in  the  countryside  or  from  domestic  animals, particularly dogs, in the home. The majority of patients and almost all fatal cases are children. After the tick has been attached for 5-6 days, a progressive ascending, lower motor neuron paralysis develops with paraesthesiae. Often, a child, who may have been irritable for the previous 24 h, falls on getting out of bed first thing in the morning and is found to be weak or ataxic. Paralysis increases over the next few  days:  death  results  from  bulbar  and  respiratory  paralysis  and aspiration  of  stomach  contents.  Vomiting  is  a  feature  of  the  more acute course of I. holocyclus envenoming.\\nThis  clinical  picture  is  often  misinterpreted  as  poliomyelitis.  Other neurologic conditions, including Guillain-Barré syndrome, paralytic rabies, Eaton-Lambert syndrome, myasthenia gravis or botulism, may also be suspected. Diagnosis depends on finding the tick, which is likely to be concealed in a crevice, orifice or hairy area of the body. The scalp is the commonest place. Fatal tick paralysis has been caused by a tick attached to the tympanic membrane.\\n---\\n[SYMPTOMS]\\nContent: The clinical course is insidious and unpredictable. Initially, symptoms are mild or absent. As a result, patients present late (2-14 days after ingestion)  prompted  by  symptoms  of  emerging  renal  dysfunction (headache, thirst, chills, fatigue, muscle pain, lumbar and flank discomfort). Polyuria may be followed by oliguria and anuria. Pyuria is a characteristic finding. Renal function may recover completely, partially or not at all. The frequency of end-stage renal failure varies in different series of patients between 10% and 40%.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Most patients with VEE have a history of exposure to mosquitoes in regions  of  humid  tropical  forests  or  have  been  present  during  an equine epizootic  [2].

       "    'content': \"PATIENT QUESTION:\\nA 35-year-old previously healthy man from a rural area in the western United States presents with fever, chills, severe muscle aches, and \\nheadache for 3 days, followed by progressive cough and shortness of breath. He reports recently cleaning an unused barn with visible rodent \\ndroppings. Vital signs show hypotension and tachycardia. Which diagnosis best explains this clinical presentation?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Rabies\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was paralytic rabies, caused by the rabies lyssavirus. This was confirmed by the detection of rabies viral RNA through RT-PCR in a saliva sample collected at admission. The diagnosis was strongly supported by the patient's history of a WHO category III stray dog bite in a rabies-endemic country, the rapidly progressive febrile quadriparesis, the development of autonomic instability, and the critical omission of rabies immunoglobulin during post-exposure prophylaxis. The clinical course and confirmatory laboratory test ruled out other neurological conditions considered in the differential.\\nVitals: On admission, his blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, pulse 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute, and temperature 38.5°C (101.3°F).\\nContent: A 20-year-old man presented with fever for 4 days, followed by tingling and weakness that began in his left leg and then rapidly progressed to involve all four limbs over the next 2 days. The onset of symptoms occurred about one month after a stray dog bite. After admission, he developed autonomic instability, evidenced by increased perspiration and significant variability in heart rate and blood pressure. He also developed dysphagia and respiratory distress, requiring mechanical ventilation on the third day after hospitalization. The patient died due to sudden cardiac arrest on the fifth day of hospitalization, which was nine days post-onset of symptoms.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES [4]]\\nContent: Ticks  are  picked  up  in  the  countryside  or  from  domestic  animals, particularly dogs, in the home. The majority of patients and almost all fatal cases are children. After the tick has been attached for 5-6 days, a progressive ascending, lower motor neuron paralysis develops with paraesthesiae. Often, a child, who may have been irritable for the previous 24 h, falls on getting out of bed first thing in the morning and is found to be weak or ataxic. Paralysis increases over the next few  days:  death  results  from  bulbar  and  respiratory  paralysis  and aspiration  of  stomach  contents.  Vomiting  is  a  feature  of  the  more acute course of I. holocyclus envenoming.\\nThis  clinical  picture  is  often  misinterpreted  as  poliomyelitis.  Other neurologic conditions, including Guillain-Barré syndrome, paralytic rabies, Eaton-Lambert syndrome, myasthenia gravis or botulism, may also be suspected. Diagnosis depends on finding the tick, which is likely to be concealed in a crevice, orifice or hairy area of the body. The scalp is the commonest place. Fatal tick paralysis has been caused by a tick attached to the tympanic membrane.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Amoebic liver abscess\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is an amoebic liver abscess, caused by Entamoeba histolytica. This is supported by the clinical triad of fever and tender hepatomegaly with right intercostal tenderness, imaging findings of a large solitary liver lesion with an elevated hemidiaphragm, and the aspiration of characteristic 'brownish pus'. The diagnosis was further confirmed by the patient's rapid clinical response to metronidazole therapy and the relevant epidemiological risk factor of consuming locally brewed alcohol known to be associated with amoebiasis.\\nVitals: On examination, the patient's temperature was 38.3 °C (100.8 °F), blood pressure was 100/80 mmHg, pulse was 102 bpm, and respiratory rate was 24 breath cycles per minute.\\nContent: For the past week, the patient experienced fever, chills, headache, and body aches, along with severe right-hypochondrial pain. The abdominal pain is described as constant, dull, radiating to the right shoulder, and exacerbated by coughing and resting on the right side. Over the last few days, he also developed a dry cough, has vomited twice, and has lost his appetite.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis for both patients was Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome (HCPS), caused by Andesvirus (ANDV), a New World hantavirus. This was confirmed by PCR and serology. The diagnosis was strongly supported by the patients' travel history to the Chile-Argentinian border region, which is endemic for ANDV, their outdoor activities, and the clinical presentation of acute febrile illness with progressive respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, and in the wife's case, multi-organ failure and hemorrhagic complications. Other respiratory viruses and many viral hemorrhagic fevers were ruled out by negative testing and incompatible incubation periods, leaving hantavirus as the most fitting explanation given the epidemiological context and clinical course.\\nVitals: For the husband on admission: BP 90/55 mmHg, pulse 120 beats per minute, oxygen saturation 94% on ambient air, and temperature 39°C (102.2°F). For the wife on admission (3 weeks after husband's admission): normal blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen saturation, temperature 38.6°C (101.5°F).\\nContent: The husband developed fever (39°C, 102.2°F), myalgias, and generalized weakness on the flight back to Switzerland, which did not respond to symptomatic treatment. Four days later, at presentation, he was still febrile, too weak to walk unassisted, and developed shortness of breath with oxygen desaturation and bilateral interstitial infiltrates on chest x-ray. Three weeks after her husband's admission, his wife presented with similar complaints and was admitted to the same hospital. She deteriorated rapidly within 24 hours, developing cardiorespiratory failure requiring ECMO, multi-organ failure needing hemodialysis, and profuse bleeding from puncture sites in the context of disseminated intravascular coagulation, necessitating mass transfusions.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: present  as  a  wide  variety  of  abnormalities  that  includes  dyspnea, angina, syncope, diminished heart sounds, new or altered murmurs, conductive disturbance arrhythmias, ectopic beats, a gallop rhythm, cardiac enlargement, low cardiac output or hypotension. Although up to 65% of patients have electrocardiographic (ECG) evidence of myocarditis after 1-2 weeks from onset, most are asymptomatic. Clinically significant myocarditis develops in 7-20% of patients with respiratory diphtheria compared with 0-5% with cutaneous diphtheria. Abnormalities  in  ECG  pattern,  particularly  ST-T  wave  changes  and  firstdegree  heart  block,  can  progress  to  more  severe  forms  of  block, atrioventricular dissociation and other arrhythmias that carry a poor prognosis.  Patients  with  ECG  findings  that  do  not  exceed  ectopic supraventricular beat, sinus bradycardia, prolonged P-R interval and minor T-wave changes generally do well and are associated with little, if  any,  increased  risk  of  death.  Patients  with  single  bundle  branch blocks, QRS widening, ST-T segment shifts, T wave inversions, prolonged QT wave intervals or supraventricular tachycardias are associated  with  a  10-50%  mortality.  The  fatality  rate  exceeds  90%  in patients with third-degree block, more than two ventricular premature  contractions,  ventricular  tachycardia  and  congestive  cardiac failure. Cardiac pacing appears to be of little value in patients with third-degree block. These patients have severe cardiac injury and die from congestive cardiac failure or ventricular tachycardia. Death from myocarditis  occurs  within  two  weeks  of  illness  onset.  Abatement of ECG abnormalities reflects improving cardiac function and favors survival.  Elevations  of  serum  creatine  kinase  and  serum  aspartate aminotransaminase/serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (AST/ SGOT)  concentration  closely  parallel  the  intensity  of  myocarditis and so may be used to monitor its course. Detectable cardiac injury may completely resolve over months, or even years, but some survivors are left with persistent conduction defects requiring long-term follow-up [8].\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

Her caregiver reports poor oral intake over several days due to a sore \\nthroat. On examination, she has dry mucous membranes, sunken eyes, tachycardia, and poor skin turgor.What is the most likely \\ndiagnosis, and what factors contributed to her condition?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[DIAGNOSIS]\\nContent: The  differential  diagnosis  of  heat  illness  requires  a  history  of  heat exposure,  a  detailed  physical  exam  and  bedside  studies.  Infectious etiologies and rare causes of hyperthermia need to be ruled out. The differential diagnosis should include malignant hyperthermia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, endocrine and hypothalamic disorders, and fictitious hyperthermia. Heat edema and heat syncope are suggested by advanced patient age, deconditioning, low cardiac reserve and recent arrival in the tropics from cooler regions. Miliaria, a distinct heat dermatosis, is differentiated from other tropical skin maladies  by  the  timing,  distribution  and  physical  appearance  of  skin vesicles.  Miliaria  responds  promptly  to  antihistamines  or  dilute topical chlorhexidine. Heat cramps are a second common malady in unacclimatized individuals;  diagnosis  is  suggested  by  resolution  of cramps with rest and cool treatment, stretching and fluids, and electrolyte  repletion.  The  two  most  dangerous  heat  illnesses  -  heat exhaustion and heat stroke - have overlapping clinical features and are discussed in greater detail below.\\n---\\n[PHYSICAL EXAM]\\nDisease: Cholera\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is cholera, caused by Vibrio cholerae O1, Serotype Ogawa, biotype El Tor. This was established based on the classic clinical syndrome of profuse rice-water diarrhea leading to severe dehydration and shock, combined with a clear epidemiological link to a contaminated water source during an outbreak. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by stool microscopy showing characteristic motile bacilli inhibited by specific antiserum and by positive stool culture for V. cholerae.\\nVitals: On admission, the patient was afebrile with a pulse rate of 110 bpm (low volume) and a blood pressure of 90/50 mmHg. After initial intravenous rehydration, her pulse rate improved to 84 bpm and her blood pressure rose to 100/70 mmHg.\\nContent: On examination, the patient was stuporous and responded minimally to painful stimuli (GCS 9/15). She exhibited clear signs of severe dehydration, including sunken eyes, a dry mouth, a scaphoid abdomen, and very slow skin turgor recoil. The remainder of her systemic examination was normal.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Stevens-Johnson syndrome\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), a severe drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction. This clinical diagnosis is based on the patient's generalized maculopapular rash with extensive mucous membrane involvement (oral, conjunctival, genital), which appeared approximately four weeks after starting nevirapine and co-trimoxazole, both of which are highly implicated drugs. The diagnosis is further supported by the much higher incidence of SJS in HIV-positive individuals. Infectious causes like malaria were ruled out with negative testing.\\nVitals: Temperature is 37.7°C (99.9°F), blood pressure is 120/68 mmHg, pulse is 90 bpm, and respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute.\\nContent: The patient developed a productive cough with whitish sputum, followed one day later by a generalized skin rash that started on her trunk and spread to the extremities and mucosal membranes. Over the past two days, she also developed a sore throat and dysuria. The rash involves her lips, oral mucosa, conjunctivae, and genital mucosa, and has made talking and eating difficult and painful.\\n---\\n[MODERATE CASES:]\\nContent: Add basic blood chemistries; test for sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine.\\nSevere cases (e.g. CNS disturbances):\\nAdd aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine aminiotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), uric acid, calcium, phosphate, coagulation studies (PT and PTT, Ebrinogen); consider arterial blood gas for accurate determination of physiologic pH.\\nHeat exhaustion is an imprecise clinical syndrome characterized by nonspecific findings unified under a history of heat exposure. Core body temperature for heat exhaustion is < 40°C. Common symptoms include  nausea  and  vomiting,  headache  and weakness.  Respiratory rate  may  be  elevated.  The  cardiac  and  pulmonary  exam  may  be normal; however, tachycardia may be present from concomitant dehydration. The presence of sweating in heat exhaustion patients is an important finding as it is frequently  absent in heat stroke patients. The  patient's  mental  status  may  suggest  mild  confusion  and  complaints may include dizziness. Symptoms of heat exhaustion tend to resolve with any modest interventions that lower body temperature.\\nHeat  stroke  is  a  life-threatening  condition  defined  by  a  core  body temperature > 40°C and mental status or neurologic symptoms that do not respond to initial therapy (rest, cold treatment and hydration) [13]. Patients may be combative, with delirium, seizure, obtundation or coma. Clues to differentiate early heat stroke from heat exhaustion include significant  mental  status  changes,  diarrhea  and  dry  skin  in heat  stroke.  A  minority  of  heat  stroke  casualties  may  present  with sweating; however, this usually stops as thermoregulation continues to fail. Complications of heat stroke include acute renal failure from rhabdomyolysis, liver failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), seizure, coma and death [1].

What is the most likely diagnosis?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[CUTANEOUS ULCER]\\nContent: Beside pyodermas, the main cause of cutaneous ulcer  is cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) (Fig. 147.9). Old World CL (caused primarily by Leishmania  major and L.  tropica )  usually  occurs  in  travelers  to  subSaharan and North Africa, the Mediterranean basin, and the Middle East. New World CL (caused primarily by species of L. braziliensis and L. mexicana complexes) usually occurs in travelers to the forested areas of South and Central America. The clinical forms of CL also include papules, nodules, plaques and nodular lymphangitis [4]. The average number  of  cutaneous  lesions  varies  from  one  to  three  and  rarely exceeds ten per patient. Usual features of CL include return from an endemic country in  the New  or Old  World,  anatomic  location  on exposed skin (face, arms, legs), absence of pain, chronicity (more than\\n1 month duration), and failure of antibiotic treatment (which is often prescribed to treat 'pyoderma').\\nOther causes of cutaneous ulcer in returned travelers include inoculation eschars seen during rickettsioses (e.g. African tick bite fever) (Fig. 147.10),  the  early  stage  of  African  trypanosomiasis  (trypanosomal chancre) (Fig. 147.1 1), and less commonly, cutaneous anthrax.

The diagnosis was established based on the characteristic clinical presentation of progressive, indurated ulcers with undermined edges on the extremity of a child from an endemic region in West Africa. It was definitively confirmed by a positive PCR result for M. ulcerans from a wound swab. The paradoxical enlargement of one ulcer during therapy is a known phenomenon and not indicative of treatment failure.\\nVitals: On presentation, the patient had a pulse of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 100/70 mmHg, and a temperature of 37.9 °C (100.2 °F).\\nContent: The most likely diagnosis was considered to be Buruli ulcer, based on the geographical region, young age of the patient, location of the lesions on an extremity, and classic clinical picture.

This was confirmed by multiple laboratory findings: blood cultures grew gram-positive rods, a skin biopsy demonstrated abundant bacilli positive for B. anthracis antigens by immunohistochemistry, and convalescent serology was positive for antibodies to protective antigen. The diagnosis was supported by the epidemiological context of his occupation as a postal worker handling contaminated mail during a bioterrorism event.\\nVitals: On examination, his temperature was 36.9 °C (98.4 °F), pulse was 118 bpm, blood pressure was 138/90mmHg, and respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute.\\nContent: The differential diagnosis for the ulcerative skin lesion with massive swelling included bacterial ecthyma (Streptococcus, Staphylococcus), rickettsial diseases, necrotic arachnidism, rat-bite fevers, ulceroglandular tularemia, and bubonic plague. However, given the ongoing investigation of a possible bioterrorism event in the United States, cutaneous anthrax was considered the most important diagnosis to rule in.\\n---\\n[PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS]\\nContent: The chance of acquiring O. volvulus infection  increases with  greater exposure time in endemic regions (Box 1 12.1). Some patients may be diagnosed through investigation of eosinophilia. A presumptive diagnosis can be made based on a history of exposure in an endemic area,  the  presence of subcutaneous  nodules,  or typical  skin  and/or ocular signs. Early onchodermatitis is rarely diagnosed correctly and must be distinguished from atopic dermatitis, food allergies, contact dermatitis, insect bites and scabies. Chronic skin lesions can be mistaken  for  severe  chronic  eczema,  malnutrition  and  presbydermia. 'Leopard skin' must be distinguished from other causes of hypochromia, including vitiligo and leprosy.\\nDefinitive diagnosis depends on the identification of microfilariae in skin snips or of the adult worms from excised or aspirated nodules [10]. Ocular microfilariae can be detected by slit lamp examination. The chances of detection are increased if patients are asked to sit with their head between their legs for up to 10 minutes prior to examination. Microfilariae in the anterior chamber are seen as small wriggling worms. Live microfilariae in the cornea are transparent and coiled up. Skin snips can be obtained using a corneoscleral punch (Fig. 1 12.9A) or by elevating a crease of skin with the point of a needle (Fig. 1 12.9B) and  obtaining  a  small  circular  disc-shaped  slice  of  epidermis  and superficial dermis using a scalpel blade. The skin snip is then incubated  on  a  glass  slide  in  saline  and  examined  using  a  dissecting microscope  (or  magnifying  glass)  to  detect  emergent  microfilariae [10].\\nAssays to detect specific antibodies to Onchocerca [1 1-14]  and PCR [15]  to  detect  onchocercal  DNA  in  skin  snips  are  now  in  use  in\\nFIGURE  112.9 Sampling  of  skin  for  diagnosis  of O.  volvulus infection.

What is the most likely diagnosis?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[PNEUMONIA]\\nContent: Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common bacterial cause of pneumonia. Upper  respiratory  involvement  often  precedes  the  onset  of pneumococcal  pneumonia,  which  is  characterized  by  fever,  chills, malaise and sweating. The patient is flushed and febrile with a rapid pulse and respiratory rate. Dyspnea is associated with a nonproductive cough, and sputum, if present, may be thick, tenacious or 'rusty' . Severe pleuritic chest pain causing tachypnea and grunting respiration is often present. Such symptoms are abrupt in young, immunocompetent patients (Fig.1.1) [6].\\nIn elderly patients, symptoms may be few and can be dominated by confusion, delirium and prostration [7]. Physical examination of the affected lung, usually the lower lobe, reveals diminished lung expansion, impaired percussion note, decreased breath sounds, crepitations (crackles/rales)  and  bronchial  breath  sounds.  Cyanosis  is  common and a herpes simplex eruption may be seen on the lips. With proper treatment,  most  patients  with  pneumococcal  pneumonia  improve clinically  and  radiographically  within  1-2  weeks.  When  resolution occurs, fever subsides within a week as the temperature decreases following  a  crisis  pattern  (Fig.  1.2A).  Delayed  resolution  is  seen  in smokers, the elderly,  and in  those with poor nutrition,  diabetes  or other comorbid illnesses.\\nStaphylococcal  pneumonia  ( Staphylococcus aureus ), accounts for 2-10% of acute community-acquired pneumonias. It is an important cause of pneumonia in children, the elderly, patients recovering from influenza, people with diabetes mellitus, and those who are immunocompromised.  Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus  aureus (MRSA) causes illness in 1% of cases of upper or lower respiratory tract infection in the community and in 10% of patients who are hospitalized. Patients  with  staphylococcal  pneumonia  are  usually  ill  with  high fever, shaking chills, chest pain, cough and purulent sputum. Chest x-ray films show patchy consolidation and cavities.\\n---\\n[LUNG DISEASE]\\nContent: Cryptococcal pneumonia is not distinctive clinically [15]. The presence  of Cryptococcus spp.  in  a  respiratory  specimen  should  prompt investigation for dissemination and meningoencephalitis. Symptoms are low-grade fever, dull chest pain, and dry cough. Focal infiltrates are  common;  cavitation  and  pleural  effusion  rare.  Asymptomatic pneumonia or enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes can be detected in previously  healthy  individuals.  Diagnosis  of  lung  colonization  can only  be  made  in  immunocompetent  individuals  if  cryptococcal disease has been ruled out (negative antigen detection and negative blood, urine and CSF cultures).\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Tuberculous Lymphadenitis with Paradoxical IRIS\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was tuberculous lymphadenitis with superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis, complicated by paradoxical immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). The initial diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis was confirmed by an AFB-positive fine-needle aspirate from a neck gland. The paradoxical IRIS was diagnosed clinically based on his worsening condition after starting ART, despite evidence of a good virologic and immunologic response. The superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis, likely with Staphylococcus aureus, was confirmed by the second aspirate showing purulent material with coccoid bacteria and the patient's rapid improvement following incision, drainage, and antibiotics.\\nVitals: On presentation, he was febrile with a temperature of 39.2 °C (102.56° F). His pulse was 112 bpm, respiratory rate was 28 breaths per minute, and he had a normal blood pressure.\\nContent: For six weeks, the patient has experienced a productive cough and chest pain, associated with systemic symptoms including weight loss, fevers, and night sweats. During this period, he also developed a painful swelling in his neck. He has no other reported symptoms.\\n---\\n[PULMONARY INFECTION]\\nContent: Most  symptomatic  patients  have  a  transient  pulmonary  infection occurring  1-3  weeks  after  exposure,  which  manifests  as  fever,  dry cough,  and  pleuritic  chest  pain.  Although  this  is  usually  indistinguishable  from  community-acquired  pneumonia,  it  is  commonly\\nFIGURE 81.1 Endemic range of coccidioidomycosis in North America.\\naccompanied  by  hilar  or  paratracheal  lymphadenopathy  [2].  In studies  of  community-acquired  pneumonia  in  Arizona,  serologic studies demonstrated that coccidioidomycosis is the etiology in 15% of patients [5].\\nTypically,  the  symptoms  of  acute  pulmonary  coccidioidomycosis resolve  spontaneously  in  less  than  a  month.  Alternatively,  the pulmonary infiltrates  may  condense  into  nodules  that may resolve or  persist  asymptomatically.  While  primary  pneumonia  usually resolves, in  5-19%  of patients, the  disease may  linger for  months, with chronic pulmonary infiltrates, cough and pleuritic  chest pain. Pulmonary  infiltrates  can  also  undergo  cavitation.  Cavitary  disease can be asymptomatic or cause chronic productive cough and occasional hemoptysis, or rupture into the pleura [2]. Cavities may also develop  secondary  bacterial  or Aspergillus (fungus  ball)  infection. Small cavities ( < 5 cm diameter) are more likely to resolve spontaneously than large ones. Chronic pulmonary coccidioidomycosis may follow an intermittent waxing and waning course or be slowly progressive over years [6].\\nUncommonly,  patients  have  fulminating  pneumonia,  with  diffuse reticulonodular infiltrates, fever, and hypoxia (Fig. 81.3). Aggressive pulmonary disease can occur in pregnancy, especially the last trimester,  and  in  other  immunosuppressive  conditions,  such  as  AIDS, or treatment with corticosteroids or tumor necrosis factor-alpha antagonists [6].\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Paracoccidioidomycosis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is chronic (adult) paracoccidioidomycosis caused by the fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. This was definitively confirmed by direct microscopic visualization of the characteristic budding yeast forms in a KOH preparation of the patient's sputum, and subsequently by a positive fungal culture. The diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's demographic profile (male farmer from an endemic area in Peru), chronic pulmonary symptoms, significant weight loss, and failure to respond to empirical anti-tuberculosis therapy.\\nVitals: Temperature 37.2 °C (98.9 °F), blood pressure 120/75 mmHg, pulse 70 bpm regular, and respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute.\\nContent: For four months, the patient experienced a chronic productive cough, chest pain, dyspnoea on exertion, and a weight loss of about 20 kg. He denied diarrhoea, fever, or night sweats. Three and a half months earlier, he was hospitalized and diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis based on clinical presentation and an abnormal chest radiograph, despite three negative sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli. Despite adherence to first-line TB therapy (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol) for several months, he showed no clinical improvement, with persistence of his productive cough which later included streaking of blood in the sputum. This prompted his referral with a suspected diagnosis of multi-drug resistant TB.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

This diagnosis is supported by the patient's presentation with chronic undulating fever, severe malnutrition, splenomegaly, generalized lymphadenopathy, and pancytopenia. Epidemiological risk was high, as she was from a known endemic area with a family history of the disease. Although an initial rK39 RDT was negative, the diagnosis was confirmed by a positive Direct Agglutination Test (DAT) with a high titre of 1:6400 and a definitive clinical response to treatment with liposomal amphotericin B.\\nVitals: On presentation, her vital signs were: temperature 39.6°C (103.3°F), pulse 96 bpm, and blood pressure 100/60 mmHg.\\nContent: For the past four weeks, the patient has experienced an undulating fever, occurring mainly in the afternoon, accompanied by chills and occasional convulsions. Initially, she was well between febrile episodes and played normally. However, over time she has developed progressive anorexia, a dry cough, chest pain, and joint and back pain.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Severe Fever With Thrombocytopenia Syndrome\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (SFTS), caused by the SFTS virus. This diagnosis was definitively confirmed by a positive SFTS virus PCR in blood serum. Clinical presentation included acute fever, joint pain, headache, nausea, drowsiness, impaired consciousness, and respiratory distress, supported by laboratory findings of thrombocytopenia, elevated AST/ALT, LDH, and CK, alongside a negative CRP. The epidemiological context of living in southwestern Japan with potential wild animal and tick exposure further supported the diagnosis, while bacterial sepsis was ruled out after negative SFTS PCR results and no bacterial infection was identified.\\nVitals: On examination, his body temperature was 37 °C (98.6 °F), pulse rate 101 bpm, blood pressure 120/70 mmHg, SpO2 96% with 7l oxygen, and respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute. His Glasgow Coma Scale on arrival was 13/15 (E3V4M6).\\nContent: The patient presented with a 5-day history of fever, joint pain, headache, and nausea. Upon admission, he was unwell and drowsy, with signs of impaired consciousness and respiratory distress.

This was confirmed by PCR and serology. The diagnosis was strongly supported by the patients' travel history to the Chile-Argentinian border region, which is endemic for ANDV, their outdoor activities, and the clinical presentation of acute febrile illness with progressive respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, and in the wife's case, multi-organ failure and hemorrhagic complications. Other respiratory viruses and many viral hemorrhagic fevers were ruled out by negative testing and incompatible incubation periods, leaving hantavirus as the most fitting explanation given the epidemiological context and clinical course.\\nVitals: For the husband on admission: BP 90/55 mmHg, pulse 120 beats per minute, oxygen saturation 94% on ambient air, and temperature 39°C (102.2°F).

Four days later, at presentation, he was still febrile, too weak to walk unassisted, and developed shortness of breath with oxygen desaturation and bilateral interstitial infiltrates on chest x-ray. Three weeks after her husband's admission, his wife presented with similar complaints and was admitted to the same hospital. She deteriorated rapidly within 24 hours, developing cardiorespiratory failure requiring ECMO, multi-organ failure needing hemodialysis, and profuse bleeding from puncture sites in the context of disseminated intravascular coagulation, necessitating mass transfusions.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

This was confirmed by direct microscopic identification of Giardia trophozoites and cysts in stool samples. The clinical presentation of greasy, foul-smelling stools, bloating, and evidence of carbohydrate malabsorption (positive reducing substances in stool) is classic for this infection.\\nVitals: The patient has no fever; no other vital signs are reported.\\nContent: For the past two weeks, the patient has experienced four to five episodes of loose stools per day, accompanied by weight loss, anorexia, malaise, flatulence, and abdominal cramping during defecation. For the last three days, he has noted bloating and distension after consuming milk products. While he has mild nausea, he reports no fever. His stools were initially watery, but after a 5-day course of ciprofloxacin from a local pharmacy (which ended two days ago), they are now three to four per day and described as mushy, greasy, and foul-smelling.\\n---\\n[ASSESSMENT]\\nContent: The goals in assessing patients are to:\\n- determine if there is a persisting, treatable infection-often giardiasis or another protozoal infection;\\n- consider the possibility of gastrointestinal disease, such as celiac disease, brought to light as a consequence of intestinal infection, or IBD presenting for the first time;\\n- consider whether the patient has a disease unrelated to travel.\\nIf, after careful evaluation, an infectious cause is ruled out and there is no underlying non-infectious bowel disease, the patient is likely to have post-infectious IBS. In this case, managing persisting symptoms becomes the main objective.\\nWeight  loss  during  tropical  travels  is  common,  but  this  is  usually regained when the traveler returns to their usual diet. When this does not happen, malabsorption needs to be considered in a patient with continuing diarrhea. Pale, foul-smelling stools are typical of malabsorption. Both foul-smelling flatus and stools are typical of giardiasis. Soreness of tongue or mouth can be associated with folate deficiency, consistent with celiac disease and tropical sprue, but uncommon in giardiasis.  Tropical  sprue  is  now  uncommon  in  travellers,  perhaps related  to  the ready  use  of antibiotics  in  the treatment of travelers' diarrhea.\\nPhysical  examination  should  assess  for  abdominal  masses,  colonic tenderness,  and  organ  enlargement.  Signs  of  advanced  nutrient depletion such as glossitis, anemia, and ankle edema suggesting hypoproteinemia,  are  unusual.  It  is  essential  to  record  body  weight  at initial evaluation so that changes over time and after treatment can be monitored.\\nA history of blood in the stools needs careful evaluation. The cause may be as simple as an anal fissure from frequent bowel movements and irritation at the mucocutaneous junction, or bleeding from hemorrhoids. In these cases, small amounts of fresh blood are seen on the outside of the stool or left on the toilet paper after a bowel movement. Blood can be associated with invasive organisms, shiga-toxin producing E. coli [9], and non-infectious etiologies (Table 146-1).

Intestinal tapeworm infection typically causes mild or absent symptoms, but may include abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, increased appetite or food cravings, gas, \\nand weight loss. Symptoms depend on the species and worm burden. In contrast, larval cyst infection occurs when larvae migrate and form cysts in tissues. When cysts involve the brain or \\nspinal cord (neurocysticercosis), symptoms include headaches, seizures, dizziness, focal neurologic deficits, muscle weakness, poor coordination, and cognitive or behavioral changes. \\nCysts in other organs such as the liver, lungs, heart, or muscles can cause localized pain, swelling, palpable masses, or organ dysfunction. Tapeworm infection is caused by ingestion of \\ntapeworm larvae or eggs from species such as Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm) or Taenia solium (pork tapeworm).

All children with watery diarrhea should be assumed to have dehydration  and  given  ReSoMal,  a  special  rehydration  solution for children with SAM. It contains less sodium and more potassium and  glucose  than  the  standard  oral  rehydration  solution  (ORS) (Box 138.2).\\nIf  diarrhea  is  severe,  then  the  standard  hypo-osmolar  WHO-ORS (75 mmol sodium/l) may be used as loss of sodium in stool is high and  symptomatic  hyponatremia  can  occur  with  ReSoMal.  Severe diarrhea can be caused by cholera or rotavirus infection, and is usually defined as stool output > 5 ml/kg/hr.\\nReturn  of  tears,  moist  mouth,  eyes  and  fontanelle  appearing  less sunken, and improved skin turgor are signs that rehydration is proceeding. It should be noted that many severely malnourished children will  not  show  these  changes,  even  when  fully  rehydrated.  Signs  of over-hydration are increasing respiratory rate and pulse rate, increasing edema and puffy eyelids. If these signs occur, fluids are stopped immediately and the child reassessed after one hour. IV rehydration should be used only in case of shock, infusing slowly to avoid overloading the heart.\\n---\\n[INTRODUCTION]\\nContent: Acute diarrhea is the cardinal symptom of viral gastrointestinal infection and is defined as the passage of three or more watery or looserthan-usual stools within the preceding 24 hours for less than 2 weeks' duration.  Globally,  diarrhea  is  the  second  most  common  cause  of death (18%, 10.8 million) in children younger than 5 years of age and it causes more deaths in this age group than HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria put altogether (Fig. 30.1). Viruses account for the major proportion of causative agents responsible for acute gastroenteritis both in developing and developed countries.\\nViral  gastroenteritis  generally  presents  a  similar  clinical  picturewhatever the virus-requiring laboratory investigation for establishing its  etiology.  Signs and  symptoms  of typical acute viral gastroenteritis include acute onset of diarrhea, often with preceding vomiting, and sometimes with fever and abdominal pain. The most important complication  is  dehydration  and  this  requires  oral or intravenous fluid replacement therapy depending on the degree of dehydration. The disease typically lasts  3-5  days  and  is  self-limiting.  The viruses  are transmitted  feco-orally  and  infect  the  epithelial  cells  of  the  small intestine.  Damage  to  the  villous  epithelium  of  the  small  intestine affects the absorption of fluid and causes watery diarrhea. No inflammation occurs as the viruses only multiply within the enterocytes in the intestinal epithelium and do not spread into the submucosa.\\nFIGURE  30.1 Leading  causes  of  death  in  the  world  from  infectious diseases in 2008 (adapted with permission from http://www.who.int/infectiousdisease-report/pages/graph5.html).\\nFIGURE  30.2 Negative-stain  electron  micrograph  of  rotavirus  particles. The bar represents 100 nm (courtesy of Brian Getty, University of Liverpool).\\n---\\n[COMPLICATIONS]\\nContent: The leading cause of death in patients with acute diarrhea is dehydration, which requires prompt fluid and electrolyte replacement. The nutritional state of children  often  deteriorates  because of anorexia, nutrient malabsorption, and the practice of not feeding children who have diarrhea. Hypolactasia is a sequela of many gut infections and may cause persistent diarrhea. Dysentery can be associated with severe local complications such as hemorrhage, toxic megacolon and bowel\\nperforation.  In  addition,  invasive  organisms  can  result  in  systemic manifestations  including  hemolytic  uremic  syndrome  (which  can complicate Shigella dysenteriae and E.  coli O157 infections), reactive arthritis  (following  shigellosis,  salmonellosis,  campylobacteriosis, yersiniosis, and Clostridium difficile infection) and Guillain-Barré syndrome (campylobacteriosis).\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

       "    'content': 'Diagnosis: Rotavirus\\nExplanation: This presentation is consistent with rotavirus infection, a leading cause of acute viral gastroenteritis in young children. Rotavirus infection typically begins with vomiting and fever, which \\noften improve within the first 1–2 days, followed by watery diarrhea that can last several days to a week. Stool patterns may take weeks to fully normalize. In adults, infection is often \\nasymptomatic or mild, but in young children it can lead to significant dehydration, especially if fluid intake is reduced. Rotavirus is caused by the rotavirus, which infects the gastrointestinal \\ntract. Transmission occurs via the fecal–oral route, as the virus is shed in stool beginning up to two days before symptoms appear and for up to 10 days afterward. The virus spreads easily \\nthrough contaminated hands, surfaces, toys, doorknobs, and toilet handles, and is transferred to the mouth through hand-to-mouth contact. Risk factors include age under 5 years, with the \\nhighest risk of severe disease in children under 3 years old, attendance at childcare centers or pediatric hospital settings, close contact with infected individuals, and seasonal exposure \\n(higher incidence in winter and spring in temperate climates).

Toxin-induced  secretory  diarrhea  continues  independent  of  food intake. Malabsorption of carbohydrate in the small intestine leads to fermentation of unabsorbed substrates by colonic bacteria; this may cause bloating, the passage of much rectal gas and frothy stools, which are all characteristic of giardiasis. Cryptosporidiosis can involve both small and large bowel, causing short-lived and self-limiting diarrhea; however, the infection can be prolonged in patients with impaired immune responses. Cyclospora cayetanensis can also cause  acute and more chronic diarrhea with abnormalities of intestinal absorption.\\nFrequent  bowel  movements  with  small  volumes  of  stool  and  the passage  of  blood  and  mucus  suggest  colonic  infection.  Causes  of bloody diarrhea (dysentery) include invasive bacteria such as Campylobacter spp., enterohemorrhagic E. coli , and Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia spp.; nonbacterial causes include Entamoeba histolytica (amebic dysentery) and Balantidium coli , which is spread by close contact with pigs. Colicky abdominal pain is common in many gut infections and is especially severe in campylobacteriosis and yersiniosis, mimicking acute appendicitis. Fever, chills and generalized myalgia are usually associated with infection by invasive organisms; these patients appear ill and have generalized abdominal tenderness.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Cholera\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is cholera, caused by Vibrio cholerae O1, Serotype Ogawa, biotype El Tor. This was established based on the classic clinical syndrome of profuse rice-water diarrhea leading to severe dehydration and shock, combined with a clear epidemiological link to a contaminated water source during an outbreak. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by stool microscopy showing characteristic motile bacilli inhibited by specific antiserum and by positive stool culture for V. cholerae.\\nVitals: On admission, the patient was afebrile with a pulse rate of 110 bpm (low volume) and a blood pressure of 90/50 mmHg. After initial intravenous rehydration, her pulse rate improved to 84 bpm and her blood pressure rose to 100/70 mmHg.\\nContent: The patient developed profuse, large-volume watery diarrhoea, passing 12 to 15 stools in the past day. The stools were described as resembling diluted milk or rice water with white flakes. The illness was notable for the absence of abdominal pain or fever. Approximately one hour prior to presentation, she became unresponsive, prompting her husband to bring her to the hospital.\\n---\\n[SYMPTOMS]\\nContent: Intense gastrointestinal symptoms  will  follow ingestion within 30 min  to  a  few  hours.

The diagnosis aligns with the patient's travel history to the Amazon Basin, the preceding dengue-like febrile illness, and the characteristic prolonged symmetrical polyarthralgias primarily affecting small peripheral joints, while other common travel-related viral and bacterial causes were ruled out by serology.\\nVitals: No specific vital signs were reported other than the occurrence of an acute febrile illness with chills.\\nContent: During the second week of a 3.5-week trip to the Amazon Basin of northern Peru, the patient developed an acute febrile illness with chills, malaise, frontal headache, generalized myalgia, and a transient, non-pruritic maculopapular rash. The rash began on the forearms about 1 week after fever onset, spread to the trunk, neck, and face, and faded after 3 days. Slowly progressive, debilitating polyarthralgias affecting peripheral joints, with transient joint swelling, also developed. Painful cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy lasted for about 1 week. Fever and other acute symptoms subsided within 1 week, but polyarthralgias persisted, showing a symmetrical pattern mainly affecting the small joints of the hands and feet, wrists, ankles, and knees. Upon return to Switzerland a few weeks later, the patient reported stiffness of the affected joints, mainly in the morning and after immobility, and the joint pains did not improve for two more months.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: African tick-bite fever\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is African tick-bite fever, caused by Rickettsia africae.

The causative agent, Brucella melitensis, was definitively identified by culture from a CT-guided vertebral biopsy tissue sample. The diagnosis was supported by the patient's epidemiological risk (origin from Afghanistan), chronic history of recurrent fever and back pain, and MRI findings of L3/L4 spondylodiscitis with psoas muscle involvement. Spinal tuberculosis, a key differential, was ruled out by the positive Brucella culture and negative sputum tests.\\nVitals: On presentation, the patient was afebrile and his vital signs were normal.\\nContent: The patient's symptoms began approximately 6 months ago while living in a refugee camp in Iran.

The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by a positive Marburg virus PCR result. A co-infection with Plasmodium falciparum was also diagnosed but was considered less likely to be the cause of her severe presentation given the low parasitaemia and high local prevalence.\\nVitals: On presentation, her blood pressure was 85/65 mmHg, pulse rate was 105 bpm, and temperature was 38 °C (100.4 °F).\\nContent: The illness began 5 days prior with fever, a sore throat, and generalized aching.

His death was due to complications, likely bacterial peritonitis related to his peritoneal dialysis.\\nVitals: On admission, his blood pressure was 200/130 mmHg, pulse was 66 bpm, temperature was 36.8° C, and the respiratory rate was 32 breaths per minute.\\nContent: The patient presented with a 5-day history of progressive shortness of breath, orthopnoea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. He also developed continuous, dull bilateral flank pain and constant nausea over the past few days. He reported no cough and no fever.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Pneumocystis pneumonia\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) caused by the fungus *Pneumocystis jirovecii*. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by visualizing *P. jirovecii* cystic forms on Grocott staining and a strongly positive PCR from a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimen. The clinical picture of progressive respiratory failure in an ART-naïve HIV-positive patient with a low CD4 count (150/μL), along with characteristic ground-glass infiltrates on CT imaging and a highly elevated serum β-glucan, strongly supported the diagnosis.\\nVitals: On admission, he was febrile with a temperature of 39.2 °C (102.6 °F). His blood pressure was 120/70 mmHg, pulse was 100 bpm, and respiratory rate was 26 breaths per minute. He was hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 87% on room air, which improved to 97% on 15L of oxygen.\\nContent: The patient presented with a 6-week history of progressively worsening shortness of breath, a dry cough, and drenching night sweats. He also reported general fatigue and a significant weight loss of approximately 10 kg over the past 5 months.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Severe Fever With Thrombocytopenia Syndrome\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (SFTS), caused by the SFTS virus. This diagnosis was definitively confirmed by a positive SFTS virus PCR in blood serum. Clinical presentation included acute fever, joint pain, headache, nausea, drowsiness, impaired consciousness, and respiratory distress, supported by laboratory findings of thrombocytopenia, elevated AST/ALT, LDH, and CK, alongside a negative CRP. The epidemiological context of living in southwestern Japan with potential wild animal and tick exposure further supported the diagnosis, while bacterial sepsis was ruled out after negative SFTS PCR results and no bacterial infection was identified.\\nVitals: On examination, his body temperature was 37 °C (98.6 °F), pulse rate 101 bpm, blood pressure 120/70 mmHg, SpO2 96% with 7l oxygen, and respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute. His Glasgow Coma Scale on arrival was 13/15 (E3V4M6).\\nContent: The patient presented with a 5-day history of fever, joint pain, headache, and nausea. Upon admission, he was unwell and drowsy, with signs of impaired consciousness and respiratory distress. His symptoms suggested sepsis, progressing to respiratory failure requiring intubation and protracted hypotension.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis for both patients was Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome (HCPS), caused by Andesvirus (ANDV), a New World hantavirus. This was confirmed by PCR and serology. The diagnosis was strongly supported by the patients' travel history to the Chile-Argentinian border region, which is endemic for ANDV, their outdoor activities, and the clinical presentation of acute febrile illness with progressive respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, and in the wife's case, multi-organ failure and hemorrhagic complications. Other respiratory viruses and many viral hemorrhagic fevers were ruled out by negative testing and incompatible incubation periods, leaving hantavirus as the most fitting explanation given the epidemiological context and clinical course.\\nVitals: For the husband on admission: BP 90/55 mmHg, pulse 120 beats per minute, oxygen saturation 94% on ambient air, and temperature 39°C (102.2°F). For the wife on admission (3 weeks after husband's admission): normal blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen saturation, temperature 38.6°C (101.5°F).\\nContent: The husband developed fever (39°C, 102.2°F), myalgias, and generalized weakness on the flight back to Switzerland, which did not respond to symptomatic treatment. Four days later, at presentation, he was still febrile, too weak to walk unassisted, and developed shortness of breath with oxygen desaturation and bilateral interstitial infiltrates on chest x-ray. Three weeks after her husband's admission, his wife presented with similar complaints and was admitted to the same hospital. She deteriorated rapidly within 24 hours, developing cardiorespiratory failure requiring ECMO, multi-organ failure needing hemodialysis, and profuse bleeding from puncture sites in the context of disseminated intravascular coagulation, necessitating mass transfusions.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Amoebic liver abscess\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is an amoebic liver abscess, caused by Entamoeba histolytica. This is supported by the clinical triad of fever and tender hepatomegaly with right intercostal tenderness, imaging findings of a large solitary liver lesion with an elevated hemidiaphragm, and the aspiration of characteristic 'brownish pus'. The diagnosis was further confirmed by the patient's rapid clinical response to metronidazole therapy and the relevant epidemiological risk factor of consuming locally brewed alcohol known to be associated with amoebiasis.\\nVitals: On examination, the patient's temperature was 38.3 °C (100.8 °F), blood pressure was 100/80 mmHg, pulse was 102 bpm, and respiratory rate was 24 breath cycles per minute.\\nContent: For the past week, the patient experienced fever, chills, headache, and body aches, along with severe right-hypochondrial pain. The abdominal pain is described as constant, dull, radiating to the right shoulder, and exacerbated by coughing and resting on the right side.

The initial diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis was confirmed by an AFB-positive fine-needle aspirate from a neck gland. The paradoxical IRIS was diagnosed clinically based on his worsening condition after starting ART, despite evidence of a good virologic and immunologic response. The superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis, likely with Staphylococcus aureus, was confirmed by the second aspirate showing purulent material with coccoid bacteria and the patient's rapid improvement following incision, drainage, and antibiotics.\\nVitals: On presentation, he was febrile with a temperature of 39.2 °C (102.56° F). His pulse was 112 bpm, respiratory rate was 28 breaths per minute, and he had a normal blood pressure.\\nContent: For six weeks, the patient has experienced a productive cough and chest pain, associated with systemic symptoms including weight loss, fevers, and night sweats. During this period, he also developed a painful swelling in his neck. He has no other reported symptoms.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Stevens-Johnson syndrome\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), a severe drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction. This clinical diagnosis is based on the patient's generalized maculopapular rash with extensive mucous membrane involvement (oral, conjunctival, genital), which appeared approximately four weeks after starting nevirapine and co-trimoxazole, both of which are highly implicated drugs. The diagnosis is further supported by the much higher incidence of SJS in HIV-positive individuals. Infectious causes like malaria were ruled out with negative testing.\\nVitals: Temperature is 37.7°C (99.9°F), blood pressure is 120/68 mmHg, pulse is 90 bpm, and respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute.\\nContent: The patient developed a productive cough with whitish sputum, followed one day later by a generalized skin rash that started on her trunk and spread to the extremities and mucosal membranes. Over the past two days, she also developed a sore throat and dysuria. The rash involves her lips, oral mucosa, conjunctivae, and genital mucosa, and has made talking and eating difficult and painful.\\n---\\n[FEVER]\\nContent: Prolonged fever is common, especially among patients with low CD4 cell counts (e.g. < 200 cells/ml) who are not receiving ART [151], and differential  diagnosis  is  broad  and  varies  geographically.  Infectious etiologies are responsible for the majority of fevers.\\nTuberculosis should be considered in all patients with fever especially if cough, shortness of breath, weight loss, night sweats, or lymphadenopathy are present (see Chapter 39, ' Tuberculosis ') [131]. Other causes of fever are cryptococcal disease (e.g. C. neoformans bloodstream infection),  bacteremia  (e.g. Salmonella , Rhodococcus ),  pneumonia,  both bacterial (e.g. S.  pneumoniae )  and  fungal (e.g. PCP), malaria, CMV, and lymphoma. Multiple concurrent etiologies occur.\\nThe  diagnostic  work-up  for  fever  should  be  driven  by  the  clinical presentation and availability of diagnostic tests. Blood cultures, blood smear for malaria, mycobacterial blood cultures and serum cryptococcal antigen testing can be helpful. Chest radiography, urine culture, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, and other radiologic studies (e.g. brain imaging, abdominal imaging) may be necessary. Certain etiologies such as mycobacterial disease, Pneumocystis , Bartonella , lymphoma and certain fungal infections can be particularly difficult to diagnose and  should  be  considered  when  fever  persists  despite  a  diagnostic work-up.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Histoplasmosis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is disseminated histoplasmosis caused by the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. This was confirmed by the identification of the organism in a submandibular lymph node biopsy via both PCR and subsequent culture. The clinical presentation of disseminated abscesses, osteomyelitis, and generalized lymphadenopathy, along with the patient's travel history to an endemic region in northern Thailand, supported the diagnosis. The dramatic clinical and laboratory response to specific antifungal therapy further confirmed the etiology.\\nVitals: On admission, the patient was afebrile with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg and a pulse of 80 bpm.\\nContent: The patient developed recurrent skin and subcutaneous abscesses, progressive lymphadenopathy, and weight loss over a two-month period. Her symptoms began 6 to 8 weeks after she returned from a family visit to northern Thailand. During that trip, she had experienced an illness with high fever, dry cough, and fatigue, which may have represented acute pulmonary histoplasmosis. Despite various antibiotic therapies prior to transfer, her clinical symptoms and inflammatory markers deteriorated.

While fever and sore throat usually subside within a couple of weeks, the prolonged fatigue and enlarged lymph nodes, as described, are characteristic of mono and can last for several weeks.

Which diseases could be causing these symptons?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[VASCULAR DISORDERS]\\nContent: The range of arterial and venous syndromes includes diseases of the aorta, atherosclerotic diseases of medium-sized arteries, and unusual vascular disorders of the tropics (Table 2-3).\\nAtheroma and dissection of the aorta is present in communities with an  accumulation  of  risk  factors,  including  hypertension.  Similarly, atheroma and aortic aneurysm is becoming more common in people living  in  tropical  environments  as  their  cardiovascular  risk  profile worsens. By contrast, aortitis resulting from syphilis is less common due  to  the  early  use  of  penicillin.  Idiopathic  tropical  aortitis  or Takayasu's disease is found in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. The clinical manifestations depend on the stage and anatomy of the disease. The disease may present with angina, cerebral ischemic symptoms, absent pulses, and hypertension - a common presentation in children [6].\\nAtherosclerotic disease of the medium-sized vessels presents with a number of clinical syndromes including cardiac pain and coronary thrombosis, intermittent claudication and gangrene of the legs, and mesenteric artery  occlusion. These ischemic syndromes are particularly common in people of Asian, Melanesian and Polynesian origin (who also have a high incidence of diabetes mellitus). Angina in the tropical environment may also be due to valvular heart disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dysrhythmias, syphilitic arteritis or anemia.\\nHemoglobin disorders (such as sickle cell disease) contribute to the cardiovascular disease burden either by exacerbating existing cardiac disease with anemia, or by causing peripheral vascular occlusion or pulmonary hypertension.\\nIdiopathic gangrene of the extremities, gangrene associated with tropical  phlebitis,  and  gangrene  associated  with  acquired  hemolytic anemia are unusual vascular disorders encountered  in Africa.  Idiopathic  gangrene  of  the  extremities  presents  mainly  in  infants  and children  with  bilateral  symmetrical  gangrene.

The diagnosis was further supported by her clinical presentation of progressive dyspnoea and palpitations, combined with objective findings of sinus bradycardia with right bundle branch block on ECG and moderate cardiomegaly on chest X-ray, all consistent with chronic Chagas disease in a patient from an endemic region of Bolivia. The patient's desire to become pregnant also supported the decision for antitrypanosomal therapy to prevent vertical transmission.\\nVitals: On examination, blood pressure was 110/65 mmHg. The pulse was regular at 40 bpm. SpO2 was 99% on ambient air.\\nContent: Given the patient's origin as a recent migrant from Bolivia, a highly endemic country, the initial differential included common migrant-associated pathologies such as active and latent tuberculosis, HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and strongyloidiasis, with particular emphasis on Chagas disease due to its high prevalence and potential for asymptomatic chronic infection in Latin American migrants. The patient's progressive dyspnoea and palpitations, combined with ECG findings of sinus bradycardia with right bundle branch block and CXR showing cardiomegaly, strongly suggested chronic Chagasic cardiomyopathy.\\n---\\n[COMMON SYNDROMES OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE IN THE TROPICS]\\nContent: TABLE 2-1 Causes of Heart Failure in the Tropics, 1 = TABLE 2-1 Causes of Heart Failure in the Tropics.

The diagnosis was established based on the characteristic clinical presentation of progressive, indurated ulcers with undermined edges on the extremity of a child from an endemic region in West Africa. It was definitively confirmed by a positive PCR result for M. ulcerans from a wound swab. The paradoxical enlargement of one ulcer during therapy is a known phenomenon and not indicative of treatment failure.\\nVitals: On presentation, the patient had a pulse of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 100/70 mmHg, and a temperature of 37.9 °C (100.2 °F).\\nContent: The most likely diagnosis was considered to be Buruli ulcer, based on the geographical region, young age of the patient, location of the lesions on an extremity, and classic clinical picture.

For  specific  clinical  manifestations  of  nutritional  deficiencies,  see  Table  8-2  and  corresponding chapters.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Thinness  and  short  stature  may  be  the  only  features  of  moderate underweight, stunting and wasting. The manifestation of severe acute malnutrition can be quite dramatic and the major signs include severe wasting,  edema,  skin  changes  or  dermatosis,  and  eye  signs.  Severe wasting occurs when there is loss of body fat, subcutaneous tissues and muscles. In a severe case, the body appears to have only skin and bones with wrinkling of the skin, the head looks disproportionately large and the ribs are markedly visible (Fig. 138.3). The skin becomes redundant on the severely wasted buttocks, giving a 'baggy pants' appearance (Fig. 138.4). A WHZ of less than -3SD and a MUAC less than 1 1.5 cm indicate severe wasting.\\nIn the absence of other causes of edema, such as nephrotic syndrome, the presence of bilateral pedal edema is a sign of SAM. A decrease in serum albumin level is partly responsible for development of edema. Other factors that contribute to the development of edema in SAM include decreased body potassium and reduced inactivation of antidiuretic hormone. Edema is detected by pressing on the dorsum of the foot for 3-5 seconds; an indentation on release of pressure indicates pedal edema (Fig. 138.5).\\nBased on severity, there are three categories of edema:\\nMild: both feet (can include ankles), grade + ; Moderate:  both  feet,  lower  legs,  hands  or  lower  arms,  grade + + ; Severe: generalized bilateral pitting edema including both feet, legs, hands, arms and face, grade + + + .\\nDermatosis is a skin condition that is common in severe acute malnutrition.

The diagnosis was made clinically based on the characteristic triad of photosensitive dermatitis, watery diarrhoea, and neuropsychiatric symptoms ('dementia'). The diagnosis was confirmed by the rapid resolution of her confusion and diarrhoea following supplementation with a vitamin B-complex. Her poor, maize-based diet provided a strong epidemiological link, and other key differential diagnoses like HIV were ruled out by testing.\\nVitals: The patient is afebrile.

In adults, other causes of dysentery are more common than in children, but all patients with severe dysentery in the tropics still have a high probability of having shigellosis.\\nIn addition to the dysenteric stool, other features supportive of the diagnosis of shigellosis include abdominal tenderness, fever (though less common in malnourished children), and rectal prolapse. During a S.  dysenteriae type  1  epidemic,  the probability that dysentery  is  a result of Shigella infection is even greater.\\nThe laboratory test that is likely to be most immediately available in developing countries is microscopic examination of the stool using either a wet mount or Gram-stain. Either will show large numbers of polymorphonuclear cells and erythrocytes. Other supportive laboratory tests include a peripheral blood leukocyte count with leukocytosis. Though rapid bedside tests for identification of Shigella infection have been developed [18], none are commercially available. Rapid tests for the identification of Shiga toxin exist, and could, presumably, be of help in the diagnosis of S. dysenteriae type 1 infections.

Immediately after delivery, I started experiencing profuse, continuous vaginal bleeding, and my uterus feels soft and boggy, not firm. I am feeling extremely lightheaded, weak, and very pale. What should I be worried about given these symptoms after childbirth?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[HEMORRHAGE]\\nContent: Obstetric haemorrhage is the most commonly documented cause of maternal death. This can take the form of antepartum bleeding (e.g. as  a  result  of  placenta  praevia or placental abruption), intrapartum bleeding  (e.g.  as  a  result  of  rupture  of  the  uterus)  or  post-partum hemorrhage (e.g. as a result of atony of the uterus, associated with disseminated vascular coagulopathy, or trauma to the genital tract). Any bleeding during pregnancy and delivery should be considered a 'danger' or warning sign and requires urgent attention.\\nPlacental abruption can occur suddenly and unexpectedly. In many resource-poor settings, in the absence of ultrasonography, the warning signs of bleeding, coupled with the clinical sign of a 'uterus en bois' (woody hard uterus which feels contracted), will alert the healthcare provider to this emergency. In the case of placenta previa, a cesarean section is needed.\\nPost-partum hemorrhage is commonly defined as blood loss of more than 500 ml and severe post-partum hemorrhage as a loss of more than 1000 ml. Most cases are unpredictable and it is vital that there is  early recognition of excess blood loss and immediate action. The majority of cases are the result of uterine atony post-delivery, either after  vaginal  delivery  or  cesarean  section.  The  recommended  treatment  is  uterotonics  (drugs  to  stimulate  uterine  contraction)  and prompt replacement of volume lost to avoid hypovolemic shock.\\nThere are a number of uterotonics available, including oxytocin and ergometrine (the traditional and well-proven first-line approach), as well as more recent prostaglandins, such as carboprost and misoprostol. Blood transfusion is frequently needed and many women in\\nFIGURE 16.1 Causes of maternal deaths in Africa.\\nFIGURE 16.2 Causes of maternal deaths in Asia.\\nresource-poor areas do not survive hemorrhage because blood transfusion services are not available at all or insufficient blood is given. In addition, in cases of hemorrhage as a result of coagulopathy, such as is associated with abruption placenta and eclampsia, the availability of blood is crucial.\\n---\\n[SEPSIS]\\nContent: Most maternal deaths from infection occur in the postnatal period as a result of puerperal sepsis defined as 'a temperature rise above 38.5 degrees  Celsius  maintained  over  24  hours  or  recurring  during  the period  from  the  end  of  the  first  to  the  end  of  the  tenth  day  after childbirth  or  after  abortion' .  Clinical  signs  and  symptoms  include fever, lower abdominal pain and uterine tenderness, subinvolution of the uterus with foul smelling, sometimes purulent, discharge with or without vaginal bleeding. Failure to recognize and manage puerperal sepsis early on will lead to septic shock and coagulopathy.\\nThe  clinical  diagnosis  of  sepsis  is  relatively  simple  and  does  not require laboratory tests. In practice, fever in the post-partum period is  often  attributed  solely  to  malaria,  especially  in  malaria-endemic areas. Full clinical examination and a thick film slide will help with the differential diagnosis, as will the realization that, in many postpartum women, such fever is more likely to be associated with puerperal  sepsis  than  malaria.  Parenteral  antibiotics  are  needed  and generally  given  for  24-48  hours.  There  are  various  recommended regimens but in the absence of availability of blood-culture testing (as in  most  resource-poor  areas),  the  best  combination  is  ampicillin, gentamycin  and  metronidazol.  The  presence  of  retained  placental fragments and/or fetal tissue in the case of abortion must be considered. Poor hygiene during delivery, during obstetric surgery, such as cesarean section or evacuation of the uterus (for termination of pregnancy or removal of retained products after an incomplete abortion), can  all  lead  to  puerperal  sepsis.  Good  hand-washing  practice  and adequate sterilization of equipment used during surgical procedures are  crucial  preventive  measures.  Prophylactic  antibiotics  should  be given in all cases of cesarean section. Infection with HIV is associated with reduced immunity, an increased risk of opportunistic infections and reported increased difficulty in treating post-partum sepsis, either after delivery or cesarean section.\\n---\\n[COMPLICATIONS OF OBSTRUCTED LABOR]\\nContent: Obstructed labor is a condition contributing to maternal death in a number of ways, for example via haemorrhage as a result of rupture of the uterus or via sepsis. Morbidity associated with obstructed labor includes obstetric fistulae (vesico-vaginal and/or rectal). Obstructed labor is said to occur when there are good uterine contractions but there  is  no  descent  of  the  fetus  through  the  pelvis.  This  may  be because the fetus is too large for the pelvis (fetopelvic disproportion) and/or there are pelvic abnormalities  (e.g.  associated with  rickets). Malposition of the fetus or congenital fetal abnormalities (e.g. hydrocephalus) can also be associated with obstructed labor. Clinical signs of rupture of the uterus include vaginal bleeding, hypovolemic shock, tender abdomen, an abnormal uterine contour, absent fetal heart and easily palpable fetal parts. A 'Bandl's' ring can often be seen prior to rupture  of  the  uterus  and  is  a  visible  horizontal  depression  in  the lower  abdominal  contour  near  the  umbilicus  which  indicates  the marcation between the thick muscular upper uterine segment and a very thin, stretched out lower uterine segment.\\nIn  cases  of  obstructed labor,  in order to save both  the mother and baby's lives, a timely cesarean section is needed. For this, the woman will need to be delivered in a health facility providing all the nine signal functions of Comprehensive Essential Obstetric Care (see Box 16.2) and referral may be needed if she is laboring at a lower-level facility. Such referral must be well organized and requires transport and communication systems to be in place.\\nObstructed  labor  can  be  detected  by  using  a  partograph.  This  is  a simple structured graphical one-page representation of the progress of a woman's labor and is recommended as a tool to monitor progress in all women during labor, as well as a documentation of the fetal condition. It consists of a graph depicting cervical dilatation in relation to time-in most cases also the degree of descent of the fetal presenting part-the strength and frequency of contractions and the\\n---\\n[HEMORRHAGE]\\nContent: It may be necessary to explore the uterus for retained placental tissue. Retained placenta is a common problem leading to post-partum hemorrhage and all skilled birth attendants need to be able to carry out a manual removal of placenta under suitable analgesia (or anesthesia) and/or refer a woman with this condition to a higher level facility in good time. Retained placental tissue and/or membranes can lead to prolonged bleeding and high risk of infection. This requires careful exploration of the uterus under anesthesia and curettage. For hemorrhage occurring after a cesarean section, re-laparotomy may be necessary to check that this is not the result of unrecognized tears in the uterus and/or faulty surgical technique. In some cases with unstoppable hemorrhage, the only solution may be to perform a (subtotal) hysterectomy.\\nPost-partum hemorrhage can be prevented-it is recommended that all women have active management of the third stage of labor. This consists of administering a uterotonic (preferably oxytocin intramuscularly) at the time of delivery, together with clamping and cutting the  cord  and  controlled  cord  traction  (gentle  cord  traction  with manual support of the uterus) to deliver the placenta. The oxytocin is given at the time of birth of the anterior shoulder; if it is not known whether this could be a multiple pregnancy, it should be given at the time of the birth of the baby, after checking there is no second baby. In some cases, this is combined with uterine massage or fundal pressure  after  delivery  of  the  placenta.  The  routine  administration  of oxytocin  reduces  the  risk  of  hemorrhage  by  more  than  half  when compared with 'physiologic' or expectant management (i.e. no oxytocic, no controlled cord traction, with the cord being clamped and cut after the placenta has been delivered by maternal effort only).\\n---\\n[MALARIA IN PREGNANCY]\\nContent: The effects of malaria infection in pregnancy are visited on the expectant mother via peripheral parasitemia and on the fetus/newborn via parasite sequestration in the intervillous spaces of the placenta.\\nIn general, pregnant woman are more susceptible to malaria infection than their non-pregnant counterparts; this is most noticeable in areas of  low  transmission,  where  few  adults  have  acquired  anti-disease immunity. Susceptibility to infection decreases with each succeeding pregnancy.\\nThe placenta provides a new site for sequestration, a phenomenon unique  to  infections  with P.  falciparum ,  and,  as  with  peripheral\\nparasitemia, semi-immune women are less likely to have placental sequestration than non-immune women, and the placentae of multigravidae are less likely to contain evidence of parasite sequestration than those of primigravidae. The receptor on the syncytiotrophoblast lining the intervillous spaces of the placenta is chondroitin sulfate A, and binding is mediated by a specific variant surface antigen, var2csa [17].\\nClinical manifestations in the mother are determined by the extent of acquired immunity. In sub-Saharan Africa, where most studies have been  carried  out,  mild  febrile  illnesses  and  anemia  are  the  most common features. In relatively non-immune pregnant women, severe and complicated malaria, often characterized by hypoglycemia and pulmonary edema, can occur. Pregnancy-induced immune suppression generally results in more severe disease, especially in the group at highest risk, primigravid, non-immune women. Parasitemia rates are  at  their  highest  during  the  second  trimester,  and  the  period  of increased risk can extend into the post-partum period for 1-2 months [18].\\nAdverse  maternal  and  perinatal  outcomes  of  malaria  in  pregnancy include anemia, miscarriage, fetal growth restriction (small for gestational age), low birth weight ( < 2500 g at birth), pre-term births and congenital  infection.  Again,  the  likelihood  of  these  outcomes  is related  to  maternal  gravidity  and  degree  of  acquired  anti-malarial immunity.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

What might be happening?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[OSTEOMYELITIS (OSM)]\\nContent: the host response will attempt to reabsorb all the necrotic material, including the dead cortical bone, or sequestrum. The periosteum will lay down new living bone, called involucrum (Fig. 13.3). If the resorption process is incomplete, some of the sequestrum may be incorporated within the involucrum. This piece of dead bone acts as a foreign body  that  harbors  bacteria,  and  cannot  be  sterilized  by  antibiotics alone. This is the stage of chronic OSM, with recurrent intermittent episodes of acute OSM-like symptoms that are relieved by antibiotics and/or  spontaneous  drainage  from  a  re-opened  fistula.  Chronic drainage from permanently patent sinuses prevent pressure build-up within the bone and patients are less likely to have acute symptoms of pain and fever, but these longstanding fistulas are at increased risk of sarcomatous degeneration. Joints where the metaphyses are intraarticular (shoulder, elbow, hip and ankle) very often also have septic arthritis.\\nAcute OSM should always be suspected in a sick child complaining of limb pain, even if x-rays are normal. Fever, local swelling and tenderness,  and  guarding are  common physical findings.  Leukocytosis with a left shift, a very elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and  a  negative  malaria  test  are  usual  laboratory  findings.  Because malaria is a common cause of fever, patients with acute OSM often present late. Another reason for late presentation, as demonstrated in a study from Uganda, is that more than half of patients have first seen a traditional healer [7]. Thus, abnormal x-ray findings are common even at initial assessment.\\n---\\n[SEPTIC ARTHRITIS]\\nContent: Bacterial septic arthritis can affect any joint, but hip, knee and shoulder  are  the  most  common,  either  as  an  isolated  pathology  or  in conjunction  with  an  intra-articular  metaphyseal  osteomyelitis.  Late presentation is common. Parents often give a history of trauma: the patient fell a few days ago and has refused to bear weight ever since on the involved extremity. Examination usually reveals a septic child, with localized swelling over the involved joint, which is painful on palpation or passive mobilization. Basic laboratory findings are nonspecific: elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and ESR. Plain x-rays can appear normal early on, or show only soft tissue swelling, but there will eventually be a widening of the joint space when compared to the contralateral side, which can lead to complete dislocation.\\nThe differential diagnosis should include tuberculosis, inflammatory arthropathies,  transient  synovitis,  post-traumatic  hemarthrosis,  and avascular necrosis. Joint aspiration can be very useful. S. aureus is the most common pathogen, but other bacteria can be involved, such as gonococcus in adolescents, Haemophilus influenzae in newborns and very young infants, and Salmonella enterica in patients with sickle cell disease. Surgical drainage should be considered whenever there is a clinical suspicion, and performed as early as possible. The downsides of a negative arthrotomy are far outweighed by the dire consequences of a neglected septic arthritis, particularly in a weight-bearing joint.\\nOther nonbacterial  pathogens can involve the musculoskeletal system: fungi (histoplasmosis, actinomycosis, blastomycosis, aspergillosis),  treponema  (yaws,  syphilis)  or  parasites  (dracunculiasis  or guinea worm, onchocerciasis). Their diagnosis and treatment are discussed in other sections of this text.\\n---\\n[OSTEOMYELITIS (OSM)]\\nContent: There are three ways in which bones can become infected: hematogenous dissemination of pathogens, a contiguous focus of infection (e.g. discitis), or direct contact with the 'outside world' from an open fracture or a surgical procedure. Acute OSM occurs more commonly in children, usually through hematogenous seeding. Any bone can be affected, but the femur and tibia account for around 50% of cases [6]. In the adult, infection usually follows an open fracture or as a complication from an orthopedic procedure. Chronic OSM is the result of untreated or poorly treated acute OSM, with residual foci of avascular  bone  and  soft  tissue  debris  leading  to  recurrent  episodes  of infections, with or without chronic sinus formation.\\nAcute  hematogenous OSM  starts in  the  metaphysis  of  long  bones, where the microcirculation is sluggish (Fig. 13.2). As pressure builds up in the purulent material, the endosteal circulation is destroyed. If pus finds its way through the cortical bone, the periosteum is separated from the cortex, which then becomes completely avascular. The periosteum  remains  viable  and  attempts  to  wall-off  the  infectious process. This becomes visible on plain x-rays as a periosteal reaction within 10 to 20 days. The pus itself may perforate the periosteum and follow planes of least resistance to create soft tissue abscesses, and can even break through the skin to create a sinus or fistula. Eventually,\\n\\nTABLE 13-1 The 20 Leading Non-fatal Injuries* Sustained as a Result of Road TraEc Collisions, World, 2002\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Cutaneous myiasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The diagnosis is cutaneous furuncular myiasis caused by the larva of the Tumbu fly, *Cordylobia anthropophaga*.

Extensive investigations, including serologies and CSF analysis, ruled out common infectious causes like HIV, syphilis, tuberculosis, and schistosomiasis.

A child with a weight-for-age of less than -3SD and no edema is  said  to  have  'marasmus',  while a  child  with a weight-for-age of more than -3SD and bilateral pedal edema has 'kwashiorkor' . 'Marasmic kwashiorkor' is the condition where weight-for-age is less than -3SD and edema is present.\\nMarasmus  has  been  recognized  for  centuries.  It  is  usually  seen  in infancy and is characterized by severe weight reduction, gross wasting of  muscle  and  tissue  beneath  the  skin,  stunting  and  no  edema.\\nFIGURE 138.6 Bilateral pedal edema in a child with kwashiorkor.\\nUsually, the child is irritable. Marasmus occurs as a result of severe deficiency  of  energy,  protein,  vitamins  and  minerals,  although  the primary  cause  is  inadequate  energy  intake.  This  deficiency  often results when there is a decrease or absence of breastfeeding, feeding on diluted milk formula or a delay in introducing solid foods in the diet. In marasmus, the body generally adapts itself to the deficiency of energy and protein. The muscles provide amino acids leading to the  production  of  proteins  including  albumin  and β -lipoprotein. Adequate amounts of albumin and β -lipoprotein prevent the development of edema and fatty enlargement of the liver in marasmus.\\nKwashiorkor, which occurs mostly in children 1-3 years of age, results from a deficiency of dietary protein and is usually associated with an infection. Typically, there are skin lesions (pigmented or de-pigmented areas with or without ulceration), scanty lustre-less hair, loss of interest in the surroundings and loss of appetite (Fig. 138.6). The edema is usually noticed in the feet, but can also occur in other parts of the body. β -lipoprotein is not produced in adequate amounts, resulting in impaired transport of fat and an enlarged fatty liver.\\n---\\n[PHYSICAL EXAM]\\nDisease: Hepatosplenic schistosomiasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The diagnosis is hepatosplenic schistosomiasis causing periportal fibrosis, portal hypertension, and subsequent bleeding from gastro-oesophageal varices. This was established based on the patient's residence in an endemic area, the clinical triad of haematemesis, massive splenomegaly, and pancytopenia, and confirmed by ultrasound findings of 'pipestem fibrosis'. Endoscopy identified the varices as the source of bleeding, while negative hepatitis serologies helped exclude other common causes.\\nVitals: On admission, her blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg, pulse was 110 bpm, and respiratory rate was 28 breaths per minute. She was afebrile.\\nContent: The patient was a slim woman with slightly pale conjunctivae, but no jaundice or subconjunctival effusions. Abdominal examination revealed no distension or tenderness. The spleen was palpable at 10 cm below the left costal margin, and the liver was slightly enlarged. There were no stigmata of chronic liver disease, no shifting dullness, and no peripheral oedema or enlarged lymph nodes.\\n---\\n[PHYSICAL EXAM]\\nDisease: Talaromycosis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is disseminated Talaromycosis caused by the dimorphic fungus Talaromyces marneffei. The diagnosis was established by the characteristic clinical syndrome of fever, wasting, pancytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, and umbilicated papules in a patient with severe immunosuppression from previously undiagnosed AIDS (CD4 count 2/μL). It was definitively confirmed by the isolation of the organism from cultures of blood, skin, and lymph node tissue.\\nVitals: On presentation, the patient was febrile with a temperature of 38.2°C (100.76°F). No other vital signs were reported.\\nContent: Physical examination revealed a very wasted man with pale conjunctivae. He had a generalized, non-pruritic rash consisting of small umbilicated papules, predominantly on his face and trunk. There was generalized lymphadenopathy, including swollen supraclavicular, inguinal, and axillary nodes. Abdominal examination showed hepatosplenomegaly, with a liver span of 15 cm and a spleen palpable two fingers below the left costal margin.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES ACHILDREN AND NEONATESB]\\nContent: The clinical spectrum encountered in congenital syphilis shows some notable departures from syphilis in adults. Many infections result in abortion, stillbirth, or hydrops fetalis. Infants born alive with severe infection show  low  birth weight, failure to  thrive,  and  multi-organ involvement,  including  hepatosplenomegaly,  rhinitis,  and  anemia.\\nFIGURE  53.7 Severe  congenital  syphilis  in  a  neonate  showing  bullous lesions present from birth (photo courtesy of D. McGregor).\\nSkin  lesions  may  display  an  atypical  bullous  character  (Fig.  53.7). More commonly, congenital syphilis presents some weeks after birth. Desquamating plantar and palmar lesions similar to those of adults are common. Painful periostitis presenting as 'pseudoparalysis' of a limb  may  develop.  Late  congenital  syphilis  is  rarely  encountered nowadays.

       "    'content': \"PATIENT QUESTION:\\nI'm a 45-year-old male from South Africa experiencing recurrent upper abdominal pain that started in my early twenties. Over the years, I've developed symptoms of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and have recently been diagnosed with diabetes. I'm also experiencing some weight loss. What could be the cause of these issues?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[ABDOMINAL PAIN]\\nContent: Upper abdominal pain is commonly due to peptic ulcer disease, and worsening of the symptoms may herald a complication such as perforation or penetration. The differential diagnosis of upper abdominal symptoms with ulceration in the stomach or duodenum includes infections (e.g. tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium intracellulare , cytomegalovirus,  herpes  simplex  virus),  neoplasms  (either  primary tumor or metastatic disease) and infiltrative diseases. Acute pancreatitis is another cause of acute upper abdominal pain; gallstones and alcohol are the most common causes worldwide, though infectious etiologies are important in the immunocompromised. Chronic pancreatitis is characterized by abdominal pain, steatorrhea and diabetes mellitus. Alcohol abuse accounts for the majority of cases worldwide; however, in several parts of the tropics, the most common cause of chronic  pancreatitis  is  tropical  calcific  pancreatitis,  a  condition  of unknown etiology that commonly affects children. Pancreatic calcifications may be seen on plain film of the abdomen, and ductal dilatation may be evident on ultrasonography or computed tomography.\\nRight upper quadrant pain may be seen in biliary colic, acute cholecystitis, acute cholangitis, acute hepatitis, and liver abscess (see hepatobiliary  chapter).  Left  upper  quadrant  pain  may  be  caused  by disorders of the spleen such as splenomegaly or splenic abscess or infarction. In evaluating the patient with upper abdominal pain, it is important to consider supradiaphragmatic causes such as pneumonia and myocardial infarction.\\nA number of parasitic worms may cause nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms including epigastric pain. In addition, parasitic infections of the biliary tract may lead to acute pancreatitis, as exemplified by adult Ascaris lumbricoides worms, which can migrate from the jejunum and invade the papilla, obstructing the pancreatic and bile ducts.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is HTLV-1-associated Strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfection syndrome. This was confirmed by the presence of a high load of S. stercoralis rhabditiform larvae in both stool (via Baermann testing) and respiratory secretions, following initial suspicion from a duodenal biopsy. The diagnosis is supported by the clinical presentation of severe chronic diarrhoea and wasting, the patient's origin from an endemic area for both pathogens, confirmed HTLV-1 co-infection (a known risk factor for hyperinfection), and the excellent clinical and parasitological response to ivermectin therapy.\\nVitals: The patient was afebrile on examination. No other vital signs were reported.\\nContent: The patient reports a 6-month history of severe chronic diarrhoea, colicky abdominal pain, and a 20 kg weight loss. This is an exacerbation of a long-standing issue, as he has suffered from recurrent episodes of diarrhoea and abdominal cramps for over 12 years, with a notable increase in frequency over the past 2 years.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Amoebic liver abscess\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is an amoebic liver abscess, caused by Entamoeba histolytica. This is supported by the clinical triad of fever and tender hepatomegaly with right intercostal tenderness, imaging findings of a large solitary liver lesion with an elevated hemidiaphragm, and the aspiration of characteristic 'brownish pus'. The diagnosis was further confirmed by the patient's rapid clinical response to metronidazole therapy and the relevant epidemiological risk factor of consuming locally brewed alcohol known to be associated with amoebiasis.\\nVitals: On examination, the patient's temperature was 38.3 °C (100.8 °F), blood pressure was 100/80 mmHg, pulse was 102 bpm, and respiratory rate was 24 breath cycles per minute.\\nContent: For the past week, the patient experienced fever, chills, headache, and body aches, along with severe right-hypochondrial pain. The abdominal pain is described as constant, dull, radiating to the right shoulder, and exacerbated by coughing and resting on the right side. Over the last few days, he also developed a dry cough, has vomited twice, and has lost his appetite.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Tuberculous pericarditis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was HIV-associated tuberculous pericarditis with cardiac tamponade. This was established based on the clinical signs of cardiac tamponade (hypotension, tachycardia, pulsus paradoxus, elevated JVP), radiographic evidence of a large pericardial effusion ('globular heart'), and the patient's HIV-positive status in a tuberculosis-endemic region. The diagnosis was functionally confirmed by the dramatic clinical improvement following pericardiocentesis and the successful outcome after initiating antituberculous and antiretroviral therapy.\\nVitals: The patient's pulse was regular at 130 bpm with a pronounced pulsus paradoxus of 15 mmHg. His blood pressure in the supine position was 90/60 mmHg. He was noted to be slightly breathless in the supine position.\\nContent: The patient was well until one month prior to presentation when he began experiencing a feeling of fullness in his upper abdomen. In the week before admission, he developed pain in the right upper abdomen, which was worse when sleeping on his right side. He more recently began to feel breathless on lying down and faint upon standing up.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Thinness  and  short  stature  may  be  the  only  features  of  moderate underweight, stunting and wasting. The manifestation of severe acute malnutrition can be quite dramatic and the major signs include severe wasting,  edema,  skin  changes  or  dermatosis,  and  eye  signs.  Severe wasting occurs when there is loss of body fat, subcutaneous tissues and muscles. In a severe case, the body appears to have only skin and bones with wrinkling of the skin, the head looks disproportionately large and the ribs are markedly visible (Fig. 138.3). The skin becomes redundant on the severely wasted buttocks, giving a 'baggy pants' appearance (Fig. 138.4). A WHZ of less than -3SD and a MUAC less than 1 1.5 cm indicate severe wasting.\\nIn the absence of other causes of edema, such as nephrotic syndrome, the presence of bilateral pedal edema is a sign of SAM. A decrease in serum albumin level is partly responsible for development of edema. Other factors that contribute to the development of edema in SAM include decreased body potassium and reduced inactivation of antidiuretic hormone. Edema is detected by pressing on the dorsum of the foot for 3-5 seconds; an indentation on release of pressure indicates pedal edema (Fig. 138.5).\\nBased on severity, there are three categories of edema:\\nMild: both feet (can include ankles), grade + ; Moderate:  both  feet,  lower  legs,  hands  or  lower  arms,  grade + + ; Severe: generalized bilateral pitting edema including both feet, legs, hands, arms and face, grade + + + .\\nDermatosis is a skin condition that is common in severe acute malnutrition. A child with dermatosis may have patches of skin that are abnormally light or dark in color, shedding of skin in scales or sheets, and ulceration of the skin of the perineum, groin, limbs, behind the ears and in the armpits. There may be weeping lesions. There may be severe  rash in the  distribution of a  diaper.  Secondary infection can occur.\\nFIGURE  138.4 'Baggy  pants'  appearance  in  severe  wasting  or  severe acute malnutrition.\\nFIGURE 138.5 Detection of pedal edema.\\nThe extent of dermatosis is described in the following way:\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

Some of these blood disorders are genetic, whereas others are caused by nutritional disorders such as  iron,  B12 or  folate deficiency,  or chronic diseases  such as hookworm infestation, HIV, lead intoxication, kidney  disease,  or malignancy.  In the future, it is likely that  immigrants  will  bear  a disproportionate  burden  of disease  due to infection-associated cancers, such as hepatoma from chronic hepatitis B and C, carcinoma of  the  cervix  caused  by  human  papillomavirus,  Epstein-Barr  virusassociated Burkitt lymphoma, human herpesvirus-8-associated Kaposi sarcoma, and HIV-associated lymphomas.\\nMalnutrition and stunting of growth can be especially severe in immigrant children and refugees as a result of food deprivation and infections. Malabsorption can result from intestinal protozoan infections or,  rarely,  tropical  sprue;  lactose  intolerance  is  common  among African and certain Asian immigrant groups. Immigrants may present with  specific  nutritional  disorders  such  as  bowing  of  the  legs  in children or osteomalacia in adults with vitamin D deficiency, xerophthalmia secondary to vitamin A deficiency, endemic goiter associated with iodine deficiency, or acrodermatitis with zinc deficiency.\\nDepression  and  stress  are  common  among  immigrants  who  are adapting to a new culture and language.

The  onset  of  clinical disease is insidious, with malaise, anorexia, chills, headache, myalgias and  fever  (38-39°C).  A  few  days  later,  patients  develop  constitutional,  gastrointestinal,  neurologic  and  cardiovascular  signs  and symptoms.  Low  backache,  retro-orbital  pain,  nausea  or  vomiting, epigastric  pain,  photophobia,  dizziness,  and  constipation  or  mild diarrhea might be present in patients. Common absence of productive cough or nasal congestion is helpful in distinguishing the initial symptoms of Argentine hemorrhagic fever from those of influenza or other acute respiratory infections.\\nAs with many other infectious diseases, the first  clinical  manifestations of South American hemorrhagic fevers are nonspecific and can be confused with several acute febrile conditions, therefore the history of potential exposure to infected rodents is critical in the case of South American hemorrhagic fevers. Among the infectious diseases, the differential diagnosis includes typhoid fever, hepatitis, infectious mononucleosis,  leptospirosis,  hantavirus  pulmonary  syndrome,  dengue, dengue hemorrhagic fever and rickettsioses. Malaria should also be considered in endemic areas. Diseases presenting with hematologic or  neurologic  alterations,  such  as  intoxications,  rheumatic  diseases and blood dyscrasias may also be mistaken for hemorrhagic fever. In the respective endemic areas, or in patients with a history of travel to the specific geographic regions, a febrile syndrome with proteinuria, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia is suspicious of one of the South American hemorrhagic fever [6, 7].\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

This was a clinical diagnosis based on the patient's presentation with fever after travel to an endemic area in Southern Africa, and the pathognomonic finding of an inoculation eschar with regional lymphadenitis. The primary differential of malaria was ruled out with negative blood tests.

The diagnosis was confirmed by the rapid and complete resolution of symptoms after a single dose of ivermectin.\\nContent: The patient developed three intensely itchy skin eruptions on both upper thighs just after arriving in Australia, one week prior to presentation. The itch was so severe that it kept him awake at night. He reported no fever, cough, or wheeze and was otherwise completely well.\\n---\\n[DIAGNOSIS]\\nContent: The  differential  diagnosis  of  heat  illness  requires  a  history  of  heat exposure,  a  detailed  physical  exam  and  bedside  studies.  Infectious etiologies and rare causes of hyperthermia need to be ruled out. The differential diagnosis should include malignant hyperthermia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, endocrine and hypothalamic disorders, and fictitious hyperthermia. Heat edema and heat syncope are suggested by advanced patient age, deconditioning, low cardiac reserve and recent arrival in the tropics from cooler regions. Miliaria, a distinct heat dermatosis, is differentiated from other tropical skin maladies  by  the  timing,  distribution  and  physical  appearance  of  skin vesicles.  Miliaria  responds  promptly  to  antihistamines  or  dilute topical chlorhexidine. Heat cramps are a second common malady in unacclimatized individuals;  diagnosis  is  suggested  by  resolution  of cramps with rest and cool treatment, stretching and fluids, and electrolyte  repletion.  The  two  most  dangerous  heat  illnesses  -  heat exhaustion and heat stroke - have overlapping clinical features and are discussed in greater detail below.\\n---\\n[CHIEF COMPLAINT]\\nDisease: Brucella endocarditis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was active Brucella endocarditis.

Which deseases causing this?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[FOOT INFECTIONS]\\nContent: Athlete's  foot or  tinea  pedis  is  a  term  used  to  describe  scaling  and maceration accompanied by itching between the toes, particularly the fourth  interdigital  space.  It  is  a  syndrome  that  may  be  caused  by Candida species, erythrasma or Gram-negative bacteria, as well as by dermatophytes. In dermatophyte infections, the area between the toes may be wet or dry and, in some infections, particularly those caused by Trichophyton interdigitale , vesicular. Involvement of the dorsum of the foot or the sole may occur. The commonest cause is T. rubrum .\\nSymptoms may be minimal. It is more common in people who wear shoes and socks and is therefore associated with urban areas in the tropics.\\nTinea pedis in tropical areas must be distinguished from eczema and, less commonly, plantar psoriasis [4]. The interplay between bacteria and fungi is poorly understood but, in the tropics, secondary Gramnegative bacterial infection on top of interdigital dermatophytosis can occur.\\n---\\n[CHIEF COMPLAINT]\\nDisease: Chromoblastomycosis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is chromoblastomycosis, a chronic fungal infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. The diagnosis was confirmed by the direct microscopic detection of pathognomonic sclerotic cells (Medlar bodies) in skin scrapings. PCR and sequencing from skin tissue identified the causative agent as a Fonsecaea species (F. pedrosoi, F. monophora, or F. nubica). The clinical presentation was complicated by a secondary bacterial superinfection with Escherichia coli. The patient's excellent response to combination antifungal therapy and surgical debridement further supports the diagnosis.\\nVitals: On admission, vital signs were normal and the patient was afebrile.\\nContent: Extensive, painful verrucous skin lesions on the left foot and lower leg, present for ten years with acute pain and swelling for three days.\\n---\\n[PHYSICAL EXAM]\\nDisease: Chromoblastomycosis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is chromoblastomycosis, a chronic fungal infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue.

The patient's excellent response to combination antifungal therapy and surgical debridement further supports the diagnosis.\\nVitals: On admission, vital signs were normal and the patient was afebrile.\\nContent: The left lower leg and foot were grossly swollen, with hyperaemic and warm skin. Examination revealed several cauliflower-like masses and oval plaque-like lesions on the left lower leg and foot. The lesions were partly erythematous, fungating, and purulent, with a malodorous discharge.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Tungiasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is tungiasis, an infestation caused by the burrowing female sand flea, Tunga penetrans. The diagnosis was made clinically based on the pathognomonic appearance of a dark nodule on the toe with a central ulceration, the history of white oval granules (eggs) emerging with pressure, and strong epidemiological links, including living on a farm in an endemic region of Bolivia with a similarly affected family member.\\nContent: The patient presented with a slowly growing nodule on the fifth toe of her right foot over several days, causing moderate pain when wearing shoes. Her parents reported that when they tried to squeeze the lesion, they observed white oval granules emerging from the nodule.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Chikungunya is an acute infection of abrupt onset, heralded by fever and severe arthralgia, and followed by other constitutional symptoms and rash lasting for a period of 1-7 days. The incubation period is usually 2-3 days, with a range of 1-12 days. Fever rises abruptly, often reaching 39-40°C accompanied by intermittent shaking chills. This acute phase lasts 2-3 days. The temperature may remit for 1-2 days after a gap of 4-10 days, resulting in a 'saddle back' fever curve that is characteristic of arthropod-borne virus infections.\\nThe arthralgias are polyarticular, migratory and predominantly affect the small joints of the hands, wrists, ankles and feet (Fig. 32.2.2) with lesser involvement of larger joints. During the acute phase, patients complain bitterly of pain when asked to move. They characteristically lie still in the attitude of flexion. Pain on movement is worse in the morning, improved by mild exercise and exacerbated by strenuous exercise. Swelling may occur but fluid accumulation is uncommon. Patients with milder articular manifestation are usually symptom-free within a few weeks, but more severe cases require months to resolve entirely [1, 3]. A study indicated that over 12% of patients develop chronic joint symptoms. Generalized myalgias, as well as back and shoulder pain is common [4].\\nCutaneous  manifestations  are  typical  with  many  patients.  Initially, many present with facial and trunk flushing. This is usually followed by a maculopapular rash. The trunk and limbs are commonly involved (Fig. 32.2.3), but the face, palms and soles may also show lesions. The rash may simply fade or desquamate. Petechiae may occur alone or in association with the rash.\\nDuring the acute phase, most patients will have headache, but it is not  usually  severe.

The initial diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis was confirmed by an AFB-positive fine-needle aspirate from a neck gland. The paradoxical IRIS was diagnosed clinically based on his worsening condition after starting ART, despite evidence of a good virologic and immunologic response. The superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis, likely with Staphylococcus aureus, was confirmed by the second aspirate showing purulent material with coccoid bacteria and the patient's rapid improvement following incision, drainage, and antibiotics.\\nVitals: On presentation, he was febrile with a temperature of 39.2 °C (102.56° F). His pulse was 112 bpm, respiratory rate was 28 breaths per minute, and he had a normal blood pressure.\\nContent: For six weeks, the patient has experienced a productive cough and chest pain, associated with systemic symptoms including weight loss, fevers, and night sweats. During this period, he also developed a painful swelling in his neck. He has no other reported symptoms.\\n---\\n[CHIEF COMPLAINT]\\nDisease: Human Monkeypox\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was human monkeypox. This was a clinical diagnosis based on the patient's acute febrile illness, accompanied by a disseminated, uniform vesiculopustular skin rash involving the face, palms, soles, and oral mucosa, along with prominent generalized and cervical lymphadenopathy. This presentation is highly characteristic of monkeypox and distinguishes it from alternative diagnoses such as varicella, which typically presents with a heterogeneous rash and less prominent lymphadenopathy.\\nVitals: Temperature 38 °C (100.4 °F), pulse 110 beats per minute, blood pressure 105/82 mmHg.\\nContent: Acute febrile illness accompanied by malaise, headache, dry cough, neck swelling, and a disseminated skin rash, which appeared 2 days after initial symptoms.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Visceral leishmaniasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar), caused by a Leishmania protozoan. This diagnosis is supported by the patient's presentation with chronic undulating fever, severe malnutrition, splenomegaly, generalized lymphadenopathy, and pancytopenia. Epidemiological risk was high, as she was from a known endemic area with a family history of the disease. Although an initial rK39 RDT was negative, the diagnosis was confirmed by a positive Direct Agglutination Test (DAT) with a high titre of 1:6400 and a definitive clinical response to treatment with liposomal amphotericin B.\\nVitals: On presentation, her vital signs were: temperature 39.6°C (103.3°F), pulse 96 bpm, and blood pressure 100/60 mmHg.\\nContent: For the past four weeks, the patient has experienced an undulating fever, occurring mainly in the afternoon, accompanied by chills and occasional convulsions. Initially, she was well between febrile episodes and played normally. However, over time she has developed progressive anorexia, a dry cough, chest pain, and joint and back pain.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Histoplasmosis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is disseminated histoplasmosis caused by the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. This was confirmed by the identification of the organism in a submandibular lymph node biopsy via both PCR and subsequent culture. The clinical presentation of disseminated abscesses, osteomyelitis, and generalized lymphadenopathy, along with the patient's travel history to an endemic region in northern Thailand, supported the diagnosis. The dramatic clinical and laboratory response to specific antifungal therapy further confirmed the etiology.\\nVitals: On admission, the patient was afebrile with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg and a pulse of 80 bpm.\\nContent: The patient developed recurrent skin and subcutaneous abscesses, progressive lymphadenopathy, and weight loss over a two-month period. Her symptoms began 6 to 8 weeks after she returned from a family visit to northern Thailand. During that trip, she had experienced an illness with high fever, dry cough, and fatigue, which may have represented acute pulmonary histoplasmosis. Despite various antibiotic therapies prior to transfer, her clinical symptoms and inflammatory markers deteriorated. Initial pus and blood cultures were sterile, and a lymph node biopsy showed non-specific lymphadenitis.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Kaposi's sarcoma\\nDiagnosis Details: The patient was diagnosed with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), an HIV-associated malignancy caused by human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8). The diagnosis was made clinically based on the characteristic widespread dark-purplish plaques on the skin and palate. Pulmonary KS was strongly suspected given his chronic respiratory symptoms, exam findings, and typical chest radiograph changes, in the context of a low CD4 count (134 cells/μL). Tuberculosis, a key differential, was reasonably excluded by negative sputum and GeneXpert testing.\\nVitals: The patient's temperature was 36 °C (96.8 °F), respiratory rate was 32 breaths per minute, and pulse was 102 bpm. He appeared comfortable at rest.\\nContent: The patient presented with a one-month history of dark spots on his arm and leg, which were progressing, accompanied by new facial swelling.

They can lead to cellulitis, or superficial and deep abscesses. Some deep infections, such as hand flexor tendon\\nFIGURE 13.2 Osteomyelitis pathway.\\nsheaths, require early surgical debridement, or significant functional impairment can result.\\nOther soft tissue infections that can be seen in tropical environments are:  atypical  bacteria  (tularemia,  brucellosis),  fungi  (aspergillosis, cryptococcosis), and parasites (echinococosis, trichinosis).\\nTropical  pyomyositis  was  first  described  in  Uganda  in  1968  and presents with single to multiple suppurative lesions within skeletal muscle. It is more common in HIV-positive patients. Large muscles of the lower extremities and pelvic girdle are common sites of infection. Studies suggest up to 50% of patients report a previous injury. Examination usually reveals fever, diffuse fusiform swelling, and significant tenderness on palpation or passive stretching of the involved muscle, but usually no palpable fluid collection or fluctuation. The abscess is subfascial, within the muscle tissue itself, and poorly contained. S. aureus accounts for near 90% of cases. Multiple attempts at aspiration  with  a  large-bore  needle  are  often  necessary  to  retrieve purulent material,  and  should  be done  when  the  diagnosis  is  suspected. Orthopedic management is incision and drainage of abscesses or debridement of necrotic tissue if involvement is extensive.

The diagnosis aligns with the patient's travel history to the Amazon Basin, the preceding dengue-like febrile illness, and the characteristic prolonged symmetrical polyarthralgias primarily affecting small peripheral joints, while other common travel-related viral and bacterial causes were ruled out by serology.\\nVitals: No specific vital signs were reported other than the occurrence of an acute febrile illness with chills.\\nContent: During the second week of a 3.5-week trip to the Amazon Basin of northern Peru, the patient developed an acute febrile illness with chills, malaise, frontal headache, generalized myalgia, and a transient, non-pruritic maculopapular rash. The rash began on the forearms about 1 week after fever onset, spread to the trunk, neck, and face, and faded after 3 days. Slowly progressive, debilitating polyarthralgias affecting peripheral joints, with transient joint swelling, also developed. Painful cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy lasted for about 1 week. Fever and other acute symptoms subsided within 1 week, but polyarthralgias persisted, showing a symmetrical pattern mainly affecting the small joints of the hands and feet, wrists, ankles, and knees.

Weeks after the procedure, they developed a persistent fever, profound fatigue, significant weight loss, abdominal discomfort, and noticeable yellowing of the skin and eyes. What could be the underlying issue?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[SEVERE ANEMIA]\\nContent: Life-threatening  anemia  can  develop  rapidly;  children  who  have adjusted to a low hemoglobin or hematocrit can rapidly decompensate when challenged by a febrile illness such as malaria. Decisions regarding  blood  transfusion  are  difficult,  particularly  in  malariaendemic areas where HIV infection is common. Decisions to transfuse are generally made on the basis of hemodynamic grounds (signs of high-output heart failure include hypotension, poor capillary refill, systolic  murmurs and hepatosplenomegaly), level of consciousness and evidence of acidosis. Estimates of parasite density are helpful in predicting the  need for blood transfusion (see  below, ' Treatment '). Anemic children who are clinically stable may be treated conservatively, but close observation is recommended.\\n---\\n[ANEMIA]\\nContent: The  evidence  base  for  treating  severe  malarial  anemia  is  scanty. 'Transfusion  triggers'  are  difficult  to  develop  because  the  rate  at which an anemia develops is as important as the absolute value of the hemoglobin concentration but, in general, transfusions begin to be considered when the hemoglobin drops below 5 gm/dL [packed cell volume (PCV) = 15%]. Clinical clues include signs of hemodynamic  instability  (passive  congestion  of  the  liver, systolic  flow murmurs, extra heart sounds, rales, tachycardia) and cerebral hypoperfusion.  The  clinical  decision  regarding  transfusion  should  take into account the peripheral parasitemia, as well as the hemoglobin concentration (or hematocrit): the higher the parasitemia, the lower the hemoglobin or hematocrit are likely to drop. The usual practice is  to  transfuse  whole  blood (20 ml/kg) or  packed cells (10 ml/kg), irrespective  of  the  degree  of  the  anemia  or  the  intensity  of  the parasitemia.  About  5%  of  pediatric patients require a  second transfusion.\\n---\\n[OUTCOMES OF BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS]\\nContent: In-hospital  case-fatality  rates  following  blood  transfusions  in  lowincome African countries range from 6% to 20% [7,54-56]. In children, prostration, respiratory distress and profound anemia\\n(hemoglobin < 4 g/dL)  are  all  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of death. Around a third of these deaths occur within 6 hours of admission to hospital, so appropriate emergency management is crucial [9]. Recent studies have indicated that the respiratory distress and cardiovascular changes associated with acute severe anemia in children are due to hypovolemia rather than heart failure [57-59], and studies are underway to determine the optimal emergency management procedures for these children. In some children in malaria-endemic regions, anemia may fail to resolve or severe anemia may recur within a few weeks after  discharge  from  hospital,  possibly  due  to  persistence  of low-level malaria parasitemia [60,61].\\n---\\n[MALARIA]\\nContent: Anemia can occur with all species of malaria but is especially common with Plasmodium  falciparum infection.  The  cause  of  the  anemia  is multifactorial and includes intracellular parasites, hypersplenism and dyserythropoiesis  caused  by  cytokine  imbalance  [9].  In  malariaendemic areas, anemia is most common in those with the highest prevalence of infection, such as young children and pregnant women. Anemia caused by malaria generally responds to antimalarial treatment but children need careful follow-up as anemia may recur or only improve slowly. Blood transfusion should be limited to those who have signs of life-threatening complications of anemia, such as cardiac failure  and  severe  tissue  under-perfusion,  and  are  unresponsive  to other resuscitation measures.\\nHyper-reactive malarial splenomegaly occurs particularly in women in malaria-endemic areas and has a familial tendency. It is characterized by massive splenomegaly ( ≥ 10 cm) with hypersplenism, hepatomegaly and raised IgM levels [10]. Treatment is malarial prophylaxis  (usually  proguanil  100 mg/day)  though  other  anti-malarials appropriate for long-term administration can be tried. The presence of a lymphocytosis may suggest an underlying lymphoma and should prompt referral to a specialist.\\n---\\n[N O N I N FE CTI O U S  DI S E A S E S O F I M M I G RA N TS]\\nContent: Fatigue, bruising, and nonhealing sores can suggest blood disorders, including anemias and thalassemias, particularly among people from the Mediterranean, Africa, and Asia. Some of these blood disorders are genetic, whereas others are caused by nutritional disorders such as  iron,  B12 or  folate deficiency,  or chronic diseases  such as hookworm infestation, HIV, lead intoxication, kidney  disease,  or malignancy.  In the future, it is likely that  immigrants  will  bear  a disproportionate  burden  of disease  due to infection-associated cancers, such as hepatoma from chronic hepatitis B and C, carcinoma of  the  cervix  caused  by  human  papillomavirus,  Epstein-Barr  virusassociated Burkitt lymphoma, human herpesvirus-8-associated Kaposi sarcoma, and HIV-associated lymphomas.\\nMalnutrition and stunting of growth can be especially severe in immigrant children and refugees as a result of food deprivation and infections. Malabsorption can result from intestinal protozoan infections or,  rarely,  tropical  sprue;  lactose  intolerance  is  common  among African and certain Asian immigrant groups. Immigrants may present with  specific  nutritional  disorders  such  as  bowing  of  the  legs  in children or osteomalacia in adults with vitamin D deficiency, xerophthalmia secondary to vitamin A deficiency, endemic goiter associated with iodine deficiency, or acrodermatitis with zinc deficiency.\\nDepression  and  stress  are  common  among  immigrants  who  are adapting to a new culture and language. Post-traumatic stress disorder and other psychiatric problems are not uncommon among refugees, especially those who have experienced torture, rape, and other physical trauma in war-torn countries. Those who care for immigrants may find  that  disclosures  of  trauma  occur  only  after  development  of  a trusting  relationship  with  the  healthcare  provider.  There  are  many validated  screening  instruments  available,  including  the  Harvard Trauma Questionnaire to check for post-traumatic stress disorder, the Hopkins Symptom Checklist which screens for anxiety, and the Beck Depression Inventory [17].\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

This susceptibility is  greatest  when  the  CD4  cell count  declines  below  200 cells/ μ l. In high-income countries, the term 'AIDS' describes the most advanced stage of HIV-infection characterized by severe immunodeficiency (e.g. CD4 cell count < 200 cells/ μ l in the USA) and development  of  opportunistic  illnesses.  In  addition,  HIV  causes  chronic inflammation  and  has  direct  effects  on  a  variety  of  organs;  many patients suffer from enteropathy, myopathy, neuropathy, or encephalopathy. Disease progression in the absence of ART varies with characteristics of the infecting virus, the host immune response and other factors. In general, disease progression is more rapid in children and older adults. Among infants, acquisition of HIV in utero predicts more rapid disease progression in the absence of treatment [89].\\n---\\n[REACTIVATION CHAGAS DISEASE IN HIV/AIDS PATIENTS]\\nContent: Reactivation  of T.  cruzi infection  in  HIV/AIDS  patients  can  cause severe clinical disease with high risk of mortality [27, 28]. However, reactivation is not universal, even in those with low CD4 + lymphocyte counts.  The  only  published  prospective  cohort  study  followed  53 HIVT. cruzi co-infected patients in Brazil for 1-190 months; 1 1 (21%) had T.  cruzi reactivation  diagnosed  based  on  symptoms  and/or microscopically-detectable parasitemia [28]. Even in the absence of clinical  reactivation,  parasitemia  levels  are  higher  among  HIV-coinfected patients compared with HIV-negative patients. Symptomatic T. cruzi reactivation in AIDS patients is most commonly reported to cause meningoencephalitis and/or T. cruzi brain abscesses; the presentation may be confused with CNS toxoplasmosis and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of mass lesions on imaging or  CNS  syndromes  in  AIDS  patients.  The  second  most  commonly reported sign is acute myocarditis, sometimes superimposed on preexisting chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy. Patients may present with new arrhythmias, pericardial effusion, acute cardiac decompensation or  accelerated  progression  of  chronic  heart  disease.  Less  common manifestations  of  reactivation  in  HIV/AIDS  patients  include  skin lesions, erythema nodosum and parasitic invasion of the peritoneum, stomach or intestine.\\n---\\n[PATIENT INFORMATION]\\nDisease: Talaromycosis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is disseminated Talaromycosis caused by the dimorphic fungus Talaromyces marneffei. The diagnosis was established by the characteristic clinical syndrome of fever, wasting, pancytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, and umbilicated papules in a patient with severe immunosuppression from previously undiagnosed AIDS (CD4 count 2/μL). It was definitively confirmed by the isolation of the organism from cultures of blood, skin, and lymph node tissue.\\nVitals: On presentation, the patient was febrile with a temperature of 38.2°C (100.76°F). No other vital signs were reported.\\nContent: A 34-year-old man from Phuket, Thailand, who presented in a very wasted state with a body mass index of 14 kg/m^2. Subsequent testing revealed he was HIV positive and highly immunosuppressed, with a CD4 cell count of 2/μL. He had experienced a weight loss of 7 kg in the preceding three months.\\n---\\n[NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS AND PATHOLOGY]\\nContent: In response, the host generates both a humoral and cellular adaptive immune response and HIV viremia declines. This decline results primarily from the immune response (particularly the development of cytotoxic  CD8 + T  lymphocytes  against  HIV)  but  also,  to  a  lesser degree, from the depletion of available target cells. Within 6 months, an individual's viral load will reach a set-point; many individuals will be asymptomatic for years, although they remain infectious. The HIV viral load set-point varies greatly among individuals (in one study of 74  HIV-infected  adults,  the  median  HIV  viral  load  set-point  was 36,000 copies/mL (range: 200-717,000 copies/ml) at 120 days after HIV infection [81]) because of host and viral factors (Table 27-2), and a higher viral set-point predicts more rapid disease progression [82, 83].

Rarely, patients may have pancreatitis  or  hepatitis.  In  contrast,  advanced  HIV  infection  commonly involves the gastrointestinal tract, with the main syndromes being esophageal disease and chronic diarrhea (Box 3.5). The causes of organ-specific disease in HIV-infected patients can usually be attributed to one of three causes: due to HIV infection itself; due to opportunistic  infection;  or  due  to  the  medications  used  to  treat  HIV  or prevent its complications [21]. The etiologies vary depending on the degree of immunosuppression.\\nChronic  diarrhea  is  a  common  problem  in  patients  with  AIDS, causing significant morbidity and mortality. While the CD4 cell count is preserved, the causes are similar to those in patients without HIV. As the infection becomes more advanced, parasitic, fungal and viral infections become more prevalent. Many of these pathogens can also be identified in AIDS patients without diarrhea, showing that asymptomatic  infection  is  common.  Workup  should  include  stool  specimens for bacterial culture and ova and parasite examinations. If these\\nare unrevealing, flexible sigmoidoscopy with biopsy may be helpful in the diagnosis, especially in  the identification of cytomegalovirus infection. Treatment should be directed at the specific enteric pathogen identified and antiretroviral therapy, which is the only treatment for some infections such as cryptosporidiosis and microsporidiosis, should be initiated.\\nIn a substantial proportion of AIDS patients with diarrhea, no enteric pathogens are isolated. Small intestinal biopsy specimens from these patients are notable for villous atrophy and lymphocytic infiltration into  the  lamina  propria.  This  idiopathic  condition  is  named  AIDS enteropathy,  and  may  represent  the  mucosal  response  to  atypical pathogens, including HIV.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

She was treated empirically with ceftriaxone and metronidazole for suspected pyogenic liver abscesses but showed no clinical improvement.\\n---\\n[ACUTE HEPATITIS]\\nContent: Characteristically, there are four phases of viral hepatitis. After exposure, the virus incubates for  from 2-6 weeks for HAV and HEV, and from 4-10 weeks for HBV and HCV [4, 22]. Then there may be  a prodromal  illness ,  characterized  by  fever,  chills,  headache,  fatigue, malaise, rash, arthritis, right upper quadrant pain and a tender liver. Several days later and often coincident with an improvement in systemic  symptoms ,  the  patient  will  have  more  pronounced  anorexia, nausea, vomiting, weight loss and right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Jaundice is usual and may persist for several weeks in association with dark urine, light (clay-colored) stools, and pruritus [2, 25, 26]. Often, the patient feels better following the onset of jaundice. Most  symptoms  of  viral  hepatitis  abate  within  1-3  weeks.  Acute HCV  infections  are  usually  anicteric  and  are  often  not  diagnosed. During  outbreaks  of  HAV,  and  particularly  HEV,  there  are  many asymptomatic, mild and anicteric cases. As the acute hepatitis continues to convalesce , the patient may, or may not, remain icteric, but they almost always have anorexia, nausea, weight loss, and, if they smoke cigarettes, lose their taste for smoking. Patients infected with HAV or  HEV are more likely to have intestinal symptoms, while  those  with  HBV  infections  may  have  rash,  arthralgias  and arthritis [2].\\n---\\n[SYMPTOMS]\\nContent: - Fever, fatigue, chills, sweats, headache, myalgia, anorexia, non-productive cough, arthralgia and nausea\\n- Less common: emotional lability and depression, hyperesthesia, sore throat, abdominal pain, conjunctival injection, photophobia and weight loss\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

       "    'content': \"PATIENT QUESTION:\\nA few days ago, a small, painless bump appeared on my neck. It quickly formed a blister, which then ulcerated and is now a dry, black scab. The lesion doesn't hurt or have any pus, but the entire area around it is very swollen, and the glands in my neck feel enlarged and tender. What could be causing this unusual skin lesion?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: The incubation period reported by Clark was between 3 and 40 days in 92% of 60 patients. The most common sites of infection are the distal penis in men (Fig. 52.1) and vulva in women (Fig. 52.2). The ulcers are rarely painful. Lesions may be solitary or multiple. A characteristic pungent odor is associated with larger ulcers. Morphologic types of lesion include: (1) a beefy red, flat ulcer with a rolled margin (Fig. 52.2); (2) pale, hypertrophic lesions where granulomatous tissue pouts from the base of the ulcer (Fig. 52.1); and (3) cicatricial lesions where  extensive  scar  tissue  formation  is  seen  alongside  areas  of extending  ulceration.  Most  patients  with  inguinal  pathology  show firm nodes or ulcerative lesions in the skin overlying the nodes. The term pseudobubo was introduced by Greenblatt to describe unruptured fluctuant inguinal lesions. These are comparatively rare. A comparable  form  of  ulcer-adenopathy  syndrome  has  been  observed  in association with primary oral lesions. In women, lesions of the cervix may masquerade as cervical carcinoma and pelvic lesions can mimic pelvic  cancers,  including  the  development  of  hydronephrosis.  The clinical  picture  of  congenitally  transmitted  donovanosis  is  unusual and appears to result from infectious material being squeezed into the external  auditory meatus during  birth. Involvement of the ears and  local  nodes  has  been  reported  several  times  and  may  take  a number of weeks to appear.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS]\\nContent: Subcutaneous  swelling  is  firm,  movable  and  well-defined;  satellite lesions may be palpable at the advancing margins [12].\\nThe  overlying  skin  is  usually  intact  and  may  be  tense,  edematous, hyperpigmented  or  normal  in  color. Ulceration occurs but is uncommon, and pain and tenderness are usually absent. Any part of the body may be affected, but the most common sites are the limbs, buttocks, and neck. Regional lymph nodes are rarely affected.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Cutaneous anthrax\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is cutaneous anthrax, caused by Bacillus anthracis. This was confirmed by multiple laboratory findings: blood cultures grew gram-positive rods, a skin biopsy demonstrated abundant bacilli positive for B. anthracis antigens by immunohistochemistry, and convalescent serology was positive for antibodies to protective antigen. The diagnosis was supported by the epidemiological context of his occupation as a postal worker handling contaminated mail during a bioterrorism event.\\nVitals: On examination, his temperature was 36.9 °C (98.4 °F), pulse was 118 bpm, blood pressure was 138/90mmHg, and respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute.\\nContent: The patient presented with a non-pruritic papule on his neck that evolved over two days, associated with significant non-painful swelling and a sensation of pressure. He denied fever but reported at least one episode of diaphoresis with mild confusion and headache. He recalled a break in the skin from shaving at the lesion site three days before symptom onset. After an initial clinic visit 24 hours prior where he was given a cephalosporin, he returned due to worsening malaise, increased neck swelling, and mild difficulty breathing.\\n---\\n[ULCERS/VERRUCOUS PLAQUES]\\nContent: Many diseases begin as an ulcer and later develop into a verrucous or warty plaque. Tuberculosis primarily affects the lung, although it can occasionally primarily involve the skin. Following direct inoculation into skin,  a  firm,  red-brown  papule may  develop which  ultimately ulcerates  into  a  chancre  and  is  covered  by  a  dark,  adherent  crust. Sometimes  the bacteria-rich ulcer is associated with erythema nodosum and may eventually spontaneously heal.\\nTuberculosis verrucosa cutis occurs by direct contact. A papule forming a verrucous plaque with centrifugal progression and central scarring is typical.\\nScrofula and scrofuloderma result when there is contiguous spread from underlying necrotic tuberculoid lymph nodes. The neck is the most common site of involvement. A firm, deep, adherent, purple-red nodule  may  become  fluctuant,  suppurate  or  ulcerate,  and  form  a fistula. Less commonly, self-inoculation near natural orifices can lead to tuberculosis cutis orificialis that appears as yellow-red nodules in or near the mucosa. These lesions frequently ulcerate and are tender.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: After an incubation period of 3-7 days, a rapidly eroding genital ulcer develops. About 50% of chancroid ulcers are classic and present as irregular, non-indurated, very painful lesions of variable depth with an undermined edge and  yellow-gray  purulent  exudative  base  that bleeds readily. The skin surrounding the ulcer is usually not inflamed. Other presentations include: giant ulcers formed when several smaller ones merge (Fig. 51.1); dwarf ulcers, which are tiny, shallow, round ulcers  that  mimic  genital  herpes;  transient  superficial  ulcers  that resemble  lymphogranuloma  venereum;  single,  painless  ulcers  that can  be  confused  with  syphilis;  and  beefy,  raised  indurated  lesions that clinically appear to be granuloma inguinale. The sensitivity and specificity of the clinical diagnosis depends on the relative proportion of genital ulcers caused by H. ducreyi in the population [12].\\nFIGURE 51.1 Chancr oi d .

(Courtesy of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Photograph Neg. No. 82-9102)\\nThe  site  of  ulceration  on  the  genitalia  varies,  with  about  half  the lesions  occurring  on  the  prepuce  in  uncircumcised  men.  Kissing lesions are common on adjacent cutaneous surfaces. In women, the majority of lesions are on the fourchette, labia and perineal area (Fig. 51.2). About 40% of patients develop painful inguinal adenitis that can progress to bubo formation with overlying erythema; buboes may rupture and produce an inguinal abscess.\\nCareful, definitive laboratory studies suggest  that about 10-15% of patients  with  chancroid  also  have  a  second  ulcerating  pathogen, usually either herpes simplex or Treponema pallidum .\\nTwo recent reports, both from the South Pacific Islands, have identified H. ducreyi in children presenting with chronic cutaneous infections [13, 14].\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

       "    'content': \"PATIENT QUESTION:\\nA patient presents with vulvovaginitis and a frothy, greenish-yellow vaginal discharge, which is often odorous. She also reports vulval irritation, mild dysuria, and discomfort in her lower abdomen. What is the most likely cause of these symptoms?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS]\\nContent: Clinicians  often  manage  symptomatic  women  who  present  with some combination of vaginal discharge, vulvar irritation, and odor. The clinical and laboratory features that assist in differentiating trichomoniasis from bacterial vaginosis and candidiasis are presented in Table 95-1. A history of contact with a new partner supports the diagnosis of sexually transmitted vaginitis. Odor without much irritation is more consistent with bacterial vaginosis than with trichomoniasis, in  which irritation  is more prominent. After completing the physical  examination,  it  is  useful  to  determine  the  pH  of  vaginal secretions. This is conveniently accomplished by inserting a strip of indicator paper into the vaginal discharge pooled in the lower lip of the speculum. Normal vaginal pH of 4.7 or less is maintained in most patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis. Vaginal pH is elevated above 4.7 in most women with trichomoniasis, but an elevated pH is also found in most women with bacterial vaginosis and is not specific. The pH of vaginal material may be artifactually elevated if contaminated with cervical discharge or semen. After the pH has been determined, several drops of 10% to 20% potassium hydroxide should be added to the discharge in the speculum. The clinician then seeks the elaboration of a pungent, fishy, amine-like odor. This positive result of the whiff test is manifested by 75% of women with trichomoniasis but also by most women with bacterial vaginosis. The whiff test is not positive in vulvovaginal candidiasis. Such point-of-care testing is particularly useful in resource-poor venues [15].\\nDefinitive  diagnosis  is  based  on  demonstrating  the  parasite  (Fig. 95.1). A swab of vaginal material can be agitated in about 1 mL of saline and a drop transferred to a microscope slide to which a coverslip  is  then  applied.  This  wet  mount  is  observed  at  400 × with  the substage condenser racked down and the substage diaphragm closed. Its sensitivity for trichomoniasis is only about 60%. T. vaginalis culture systems are commercially available but expensive. Diagnosis in men is difficult and depends on newer molecular techniques [16]. The Pap smear can detect trichomonal infection, but the Gram stain is useless.\\n---\\n[PHYSICAL EXAMINATION]\\nContent: The  vulva  is  erythematous  in  less  than  one-third  of  patients.  On speculum examination, excessive discharge is noted in 50% to 75% of infected women. A yellow vaginal discharge suggests trichomoniasis, but the classically yellow or green, frothy discharge is seen in only a minority of patients. Indeed, bubbles are present in only 8% to 50% of  infected  women  in  various  series,  and  since  bubbles  are  also observed in bacterial vaginosis, their presence is nonspecific [9].\\nVaginal wall erythema, occasionally with edema, is observed in 20% to  75%  of  cases,  and  punctate  hemorrhages  are  observed  on  the vaginal  walls  or  the  exocervix  (strawberry  cervix)  in  about  2%  of women during routine physical examination, but the  characteristic hemorrhages are visualized in 45% by colposcopy.\\nIn my experience, mild adnexal tenderness is occasionally elicited on bimanual examination. This may be due to pelvic adenitis induced by the infection, but its presence should raise concerns for coincident salpingitis.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Cutaneous  irritation  in  the  perianal  region  is  the  most  prominent clinical feature. Local symptoms vary from a mild tickling sensation to pain [3]. Symptoms tend to be most troublesome at night and can produce  sleep  disturbances  and  restlessness. Pruritus  ani results  in scratching and trauma to the skin, and can lead to secondary bacterial infection. The eosinophil count in persons with E. vermicularis infection is usually normal.\\nE . vermicularis is  a  well-recognized cause of vulvovaginitis in prepubertal girls. It has also been incriminated as a potential cause of secondary enuresis  and  urinary  tract  infection.  Peritoneal  granulomas secondary  to  migrating E.  vermicularis have  been  associated  with abdominal  pain  in  adult  women.  More  commonly,  peritoneal nodules  are  found  incidentally  at  the  time  of  laparotomy  (Fig. 107.1B).\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Stevens-Johnson syndrome\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), a severe drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction. This clinical diagnosis is based on the patient's generalized maculopapular rash with extensive mucous membrane involvement (oral, conjunctival, genital), which appeared approximately four weeks after starting nevirapine and co-trimoxazole, both of which are highly implicated drugs. The diagnosis is further supported by the much higher incidence of SJS in HIV-positive individuals. Infectious causes like malaria were ruled out with negative testing.\\nVitals: Temperature is 37.7°C (99.9°F), blood pressure is 120/68 mmHg, pulse is 90 bpm, and respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute.\\nContent: The patient developed a productive cough with whitish sputum, followed one day later by a generalized skin rash that started on her trunk and spread to the extremities and mucosal membranes. Over the past two days, she also developed a sore throat and dysuria. The rash involves her lips, oral mucosa, conjunctivae, and genital mucosa, and has made talking and eating difficult and painful.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Spinal cord schistosomiasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The patient was diagnosed with spinal cord schistosomiasis complicating an infection with Schistosoma haematobium. The diagnosis was established based on the clinical presentation of a conus syndrome, a clear exposure history of swimming in Lake Malawi, the prior identification of S. haematobium eggs in his urine, significant peripheral eosinophilia, and characteristic MRI findings of a lesion in the conus medullaris and bladder wall thickening. His complete recovery following treatment with praziquantel and corticosteroids further supports the diagnosis.\\nVitals: He has normal vital signs; specific values were not reported.\\nContent: For three weeks, the patient experienced progressive difficulty urinating, requiring increasing abdominal pressure and only being able to pass small amounts at a time, associated with lower abdominal discomfort, abnormal sensations in the groins and genitals, and some erectile dysfunction. He also reports that walking did not feel normal, though he could not specify the abnormality. He denies weakness, dysaesthesia, or loss of sensation in his legs, and has no backache. Over the past two months, he had an unintentional weight loss of 8kg and fatigue without fever or night sweats. One week prior to presentation, he noticed a single episode of reddish urine discoloration without painful micturition or fever, for which he was treated at a local clinic.

Although trench fever often results in prolonged disability, it is rarely fatal.\\n---\\n[SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS]\\nContent: Typically, the disease begins with the abrupt onset of intense headache, fever, chills, and myalgia. Fever often exceeds 40°C (103°F) and is preceded by rigors. Muscle pain can be excruciating and occurs most commonly in the thighs, calves, lumbosacral region, and abdomen. Abdominal  wall  pain  accompanied  by  palpation  tenderness  can mimic an acute surgical abdomen. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and sore throat are other frequent symptoms. Cough and chest pain figure prominently in reports of patients from Korea and China.\\nConjunctival suffusion is a helpful diagnostic clue that usually appears two  or  three  days  after  the  onset  of  fever  and  involves  the  bulbar conjunctiva.  Pus  and  serous  secretions  are  absent  and  there  is  no matting  of  the  eyelashes  and  eyelids.  Mild  suffusion  can  easily  be overlooked. Less common and less distinctive signs include pharyngeal injection, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and skin  lesions.  Within  a  week,  most  patients  become  asymptomatic. After several days of apparent recovery, the illness resumes in some individuals. Manifestations of the second stage are more variable and mild than those of the initial illness and usually last 2-4 days. Leptospires  disappear  from  the  blood,  cerebrospinal  fluid  (CSF),  and tissues, but appear in the urine. Serum antibody titers rise - hence the term  'immune'  phase.  Meningitis  is  the  hallmark  of  this  stage  of leptospirosis. Pleocytosis of the CSF can be demonstrated in 80-90% of all patients during the second week of illness, although only about 50% will have clinical signs and symptoms of meningitis. Meningeal signs can last several weeks, but usually resolve within a day or two. Uveitis  is  a  late  manifestation  of  leptospirosis,  generally  seen  4-8 months after the illness has begun. The anterior uveal tract is most frequently affected and pain, photophobia, and blurring of vision are the usual symptoms.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Visceral leishmaniasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar), caused by a Leishmania protozoan.

When I was examined, the doctors noted I had a high fever, bleeding gums, and yellow skin and eyes. They also found that my liver and spleen were enlarged. I don't have any other existing health conditions. What is the most likely cause of these symptoms?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[UNCOMPLICATED MALARIA]\\nContent: Uncomplicated malaria illness  is  by  far the  most  common  clinical manifestation of a malaria infection and fever, or history of fever, is the most common symptom. There are no pathognomonic signs by which 'uncomplicated malaria' can be distinguished from common viral causes  of  fever  (Box  96.2).  The  presence  of  malaria  parasitemia increases the odds of a causal connection, especially in non-immune individuals, where peripheral parasitemia is nearly always associated with symptoms. Many semi-immune individuals (generally long-term residents  of  malaria-endemic  areas)  can  harbor  parasites  without becoming symptomatic and, in these individuals, peripheral blood parasitemia may well be 'incidental' to the symptoms [12]. In practical terms, symptomatic, parasitemic individuals who are alert enough to take oral medications are considered to have 'uncomplicated malaria' .\\nImportant  aspects  of  the  clinical  history  include  travel  itinerary, malaria precautions (chemoprophylaxis, use of bed nets and repellents) and recent prior treatment with anti-malarial drugs. The physical exam is useful for identifying other potential etiologies. In endemic areas,  the  presence  of  hepato-  or  splenomegaly  tilt  the  differential diagnosis  toward  malaria,  as  does  thrombocytopenia.  For  nonimmune travelers, the presence of fever, splenomegaly, hyperbilirubinemia and thrombocytopenia make malaria more likely [13].\\nCommon presenting signs are generalized constitutional symptoms including  fever,  chills,  dizziness,  backache,  myalgia,  malaise  and fatigue (frequently summarized as 'total body pain' by endemic-area adults). Gastrointestinal symptoms (i.e. anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea) can be prominent, causing confusion with  gastroenteritis.  Patients  may  have  nonproductive  cough  and dyspnea, consistent with acute respiratory infections. Young children and semi-immune adults may present with only fever and headache.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Following an incubation period of 2-6 days, most cases present with abrupt  onset  of  fever,  malaise,  myalgia  and  arthralgia.  A  high\\nFIGURE 33.7.1 Rift  Valley  fever  geographic distribution. Countries  highlighted in dark blue have periodic widespread epidemics of human and/ or  livestock  disease.  Countries  highlighted  in  mid-blue  have  occasional reports of Rift Valley fever virus infection.\\nproportion of patients report nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea;  symptoms can  clinically  resemble  other  acute  viral  infections, thus complicating early differential diagnosis [8]. (Fig. 33.7.2, Table 33.7-1). Upper respiratory signs are notably absent in Rift Valley fever cases. A small percentage of infected individuals (1-2%), may develop  jaundice,  hepatitis,  and/or  a  hemorrhagic  syndrome.  Case fatalities among hospitalized patients with coagulopathy range from 10-30%. In some patients, retinitis may develop with potential longterm sequelae including scotomas, other vision abnormalities or total blindness [9]. In the largest reported study of laboratory-confirmed hospitalized  patients  (n = 683,  Saudi  Arabia  2000-2001)  hemorrhagic complications included: thrombocytopenia (38.4%); hematemesis  (3.6%);  petechiae  (2.8%);  melena  (1.8%);  epistaxis  (1.2%); excessive  bleeding  from  puncture  sites  (2.4%);  and  disseminated intravascular coagulation with multiple organ dysfunction, including renal failure (7.5%) [10]. Laboratory abnormalities included marked elevations  of  serum  transaminases  [aspartate  transaminase  (AST), alanine  transaminase  (ALT),  gamma-glutamyl  transferase  (GGT)], lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) and creatinine with moderate-to-severe anemia and marked thrombocytopenia.  High  virus  loads  (mean  titer, > 1.0  X  10 6 plaque-forming units/mL  of  blood)  are  significantly  linked  to  fatal  outcomes  [1 1]. Resolution  of  the  acute  phase  can  be  followed  7-28  days  later  by delayed-onset encephalitis.\\n---\\n[FINAL DIAGNOSIS]\\nDisease: Yellow Fever\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was Yellow Fever, caused by a flavivirus, confirmed by a highly positive IgM capture ELISA for yellow fever (1:10000). This diagnosis aligned with his acute febrile illness, jaundice, bleeding, encephalopathy, seizures, liver failure, and occupation as a logger in an endemic Peruvian jungle area, coupled with his unvaccinated status. The sudden drop in liver transaminases prior to death was indicative of acute hepatic disintegration. Malaria, dengue, viral hepatitis, leptospirosis, typhoid fever, and brucellosis were effectively ruled out or deemed less likely based on specific negative tests and clinical course.\\nVitals: Temperature 38.8 °C (101.8 °C), blood pressure 110/70 mmHg, heart rate 110 beats per minute, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute.\\n---\\n[UNCOMPLICATED MALARIA]\\nContent: There are few specific symptoms or signs of malaria. Fever, or a history of fever, may be associated with nonspecific malaise, chills or rigors, respiratory symptoms, or gastrointestinal upset. A classic fever pattern, such as an every other day spike with P. vivax , is rarely seen. Practitioners should have a high index of suspicion for malaria in anyone who has returned from an endemic area in the last year: the minimum incubation  period  is  6  days.  Nearly  all  patients  with  falciparum malaria will present within 3 months of exposure and usually in the first month after return [2]. Presentation of infection by other species may occur later after exposure and can be delayed for over a year. In patients  with  a  history  of  fever,  the  presence  of  splenomegaly  or jaundice makes malaria  more likely  [3]  ;  hepatomegaly  or  splenomegaly are more common in children.\\nIndividuals who may have taken sub-optimal chemoprophylaxis regimens or were not completely adherent to their regimen may have a subacute,  or  even  insidious,  onset  of  clinical  symptoms.  They  may present  with atypical  symptoms [4-9] to include fatigue, low  back pain, nausea and anorexia, and depression. On occasion, these individuals will be afebrile. With long-acting drugs, such as mefloquine, atovaquone and choroquine-proguanil, the clinical presentation may be delayed by weeks after return. They often have very low and intermittent parasitemias, making conformation by microscopy difficult. In  addition,  patients  who  present  to  emergency  departments  with nonspecific febrile syndromes often get empirically treated with antibiotics such as azithromycin, tetracyclines, sulfa drugs and clindamycin,  that  have  significant  anti-malaria  activity.  This  can  temporarily result in clinical improvement and lead to delay and confusion over the  diagnosis  of  malaria  in  the  otherwise  nonimmune  returning traveller.\\n---\\n[PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS]\\nContent: Preliminary diagnosis is based on the patient's clinical features, yellow fever vaccination status and travel history, including location, time of year and activities [1]. Mild yellow fever cannot be clinically distinguished from a range of other infections. Cases of yellow fever with jaundice must be differentiated from viral hepatitis, malaria, leptospirosis, Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever, Rift Valley fever, typhoid, Q fever and typhus, as well as drug-induced and toxic causes of jaundice. Other viral hemorrhagic fevers, which usually present without jaundice,  include:  dengue  hemorrhagic  fever;  Lassa  fever;  Marburg and Ebola virus diseases; and Bolivian, Argentinean and Venezuelan hemorrhagic fevers.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

She also recently experienced a miscarriage. Given her significant mosquito exposure in an endemic area, what could be causing these health issues?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[MALARIA IN PREGNANCY]\\nContent: The effects of malaria infection in pregnancy are visited on the expectant mother via peripheral parasitemia and on the fetus/newborn via parasite sequestration in the intervillous spaces of the placenta.\\nIn general, pregnant woman are more susceptible to malaria infection than their non-pregnant counterparts; this is most noticeable in areas of  low  transmission,  where  few  adults  have  acquired  anti-disease immunity. Susceptibility to infection decreases with each succeeding pregnancy.\\nThe placenta provides a new site for sequestration, a phenomenon unique  to  infections  with P.  falciparum ,  and,  as  with  peripheral\\nparasitemia, semi-immune women are less likely to have placental sequestration than non-immune women, and the placentae of multigravidae are less likely to contain evidence of parasite sequestration than those of primigravidae. The receptor on the syncytiotrophoblast lining the intervillous spaces of the placenta is chondroitin sulfate A, and binding is mediated by a specific variant surface antigen, var2csa [17].\\nClinical manifestations in the mother are determined by the extent of acquired immunity. In sub-Saharan Africa, where most studies have been  carried  out,  mild  febrile  illnesses  and  anemia  are  the  most common features. In relatively non-immune pregnant women, severe and complicated malaria, often characterized by hypoglycemia and pulmonary edema, can occur. Pregnancy-induced immune suppression generally results in more severe disease, especially in the group at highest risk, primigravid, non-immune women. Parasitemia rates are  at  their  highest  during  the  second  trimester,  and  the  period  of increased risk can extend into the post-partum period for 1-2 months [18].\\nAdverse  maternal  and  perinatal  outcomes  of  malaria  in  pregnancy include anemia, miscarriage, fetal growth restriction (small for gestational age), low birth weight ( < 2500 g at birth), pre-term births and congenital  infection.  Again,  the  likelihood  of  these  outcomes  is related  to  maternal  gravidity  and  degree  of  acquired  anti-malarial immunity.\\n---\\n[FEBRILE ILLNESSES]\\nContent: Priority  should  be  given  to  identifying  illnesses  that  can  be  fatal rapidly or pose a threat to public health. Delayed diagnosis of Plasmodium  falciparum malaria  can  be  lethal,  and  undiagnosed  TB  or measles can lead to secondary cases.\\nFever  soon  after  immigration  from  malarial  countries  could  be malaria; 90% of P. falciparum cases occur within 1 month of arrival. Fever with rash suggests dengue, while fever with rash and arthritis may  indicate  chikungunya  virus.  Early  fevers  may  also  be  due  to typhoid  and  paratyphoid  fevers,  rickettsial  infections,  and  amebic liver abscesses. Fever months after migration may be caused by TB, primary malarial infection, or relapse of P. vivax and P.  ovale. Many less  common infections can be associated with fever, though other accompanying  signs  and  symptoms  may  suggest  these  diagnoses. Other febrile illness with short incubation periods, such as influenza or meningococcemia, can occur in immigrants exposed after migration, but may be more relevant to returning travelers [8]. This chapter will focus on infectious diseases that can be seen by clinicians at any time following migration and that are likely to be related to the individual's country of origin or migration process.\\n---\\n[EXPOSURE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY]\\nDisease: Zika virus infection\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is Zika virus infection. This was confirmed by molecular and serological evidence, including a positive Zika virus RT-PCR in an early serum sample and subsequent documented seroconversion with a significant rise in Zika IgM and IgG antibody titers. The clinical presentation of rash, conjunctivitis, and peripheral oedema without fever was highly characteristic, and the travel history to an endemic region provided the epidemiological link.\\nVitals: The patient was afebrile. No other vital signs were reported.\\nContent: The patient had recently returned from a 2-week holiday to Guatemala and El Salvador, presenting 6 days after her return. Her clinical presentation and travel history are consistent with exposure to arboviruses, such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, which are endemic in Central and South America.\\n---\\n[EXPOSURE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY]\\nDisease: Bartonellosis (Oroya fever)\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is acute bartonellosis, also known as Oroya fever, caused by Bartonella bacilliformis. The diagnosis was definitively established by the thin blood film showing massive red blood cell infestation with cocco-bacillary structures characteristic of the organism. This was supported by the clinical presentation of severe haemolytic anaemia, fever, and neurologic impairment, along with a compatible exposure history in an endemic region of Peru. Malaria was ruled out by negative blood smears.\\nVitals: On admission, his blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg, pulse was 110 bpm and regular, temperature was 39.2 °C (102.6 °F), and respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute.\\nContent: The patient spent three weeks on vacation in a rural area in the highlands of northern Peru at an altitude of 2400m, three months prior to symptom onset. While there, he and his wife were bitten at night by tiny mosquitoes and used no personal protection. This region is endemic for sandflies, the vectors for bartonellosis. There was no reported animal contact.\\n---\\n[ARBOVIRUS]\\nContent: Dengue is the most prevalent arbovirus in travelers. Although widespread, it is a common cause of fever only in those returning from Asia, the Caribbean and South America [15]. Most travelers present with  a  febrile  illness  associated  with  headache,  retro-orbital  pain, myalgia, arthralgia (especially back pain) and rash [15]. The rash is initially erythrodermic, and becomes petechial with disease progression (Fig. 143.3). Hepatitis, myocarditis, encephalitis and neuropathy can  occur.  Bleeding  gums,  epistaxis  and  gastrointestinal  bleeding occur but are not necessarily indicative of dengue hemorrhagic fever, which like dengue shock syndrome is rare in travelers. Chikungunya is increasingly reported in returning travelers from the islands of the Indian Ocean, South and Southeast Asia [16]. The clinical presentation  is  similar  to  classic  dengue  fever;  however,  arthralgia  is  more prominent.  In  the  majority  of  cases,  the  arthralgia  settles;  5-30% develop chronic arthropathy with pain, stiffness and swelling lasting months to years [17,18].\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

Cases due to Cochliomyia hominivorax , Oestrus ovis , C. ruandae and C. rodhani have been seen [4].\\nTungiasis is caused by penetration of the gravid female sand flea Tunga penetrans , which burrows into the skin of its host, usually on the feet or a toe, where it appears as a slowly growing nodule. The infection is acquired via direct contact (e.g. bare feet) with infested soil or beach sand. Tungiasis (also called chigoe flea, jigger flea) is widely distributed throughout Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa and Asia up to the west coast of India [4].\\n---\\n[PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS [5]]\\nContent: The evaluation of fever in returned travelers requires an understanding of the epidemiologic factors which influence exposure to specific pathogens. These factors are reflected in the travel history and include geographic  destinations  visited,  dates  of  particular  risk  exposures, time  of  onset  and  duration  of  symptoms.  The  first  two  determine which infections the traveler may have been exposed to and the last two  allow  for  an  estimation  of  the  incubation  period  (see  Tables 143.1 & 143.2).\\nAs can be seen from Figure 143.1, the travel history is vital for determining the likely diagnosis, as many infections can have similar clinical presentations. Certain symptoms and signs may give further clues; relevant examination findings include rash, eschar, hepatosplenomegaly and jaundice (see Tables 143-3, 143-4 & 143-5). Table 143-6 lists  the  differential  diagnosis  in  patients  with  chronic  fever  ( > 2 weeks), and is a reminder that noninfectious causes of fever are seen in this group.\\nTravelers presenting with undifferentiated fever should have a number of initial recommended investigations performed (see Table 143-7). Following this, specific investigations may be appropriate, depending on the differential diagnosis (see Table 143-8). Where tuberculosis is considered, it is essential that adequate samples of sputum or tissue for  mycobacteria  culture  are  obtained.  Tuberculin  skin  tests  and interferon-gamma release assays have a limited role in evaluation of patients with chronic fever.\\nRarely, fever in the returned traveler may be due to a viral hemorrhagic fever such as Lassa, Ebola, Marburg or Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever.  The  diagnosis  should  be  considered  in  travelers  who  have visited endemic regions within 21 days of symptom onset [29,30], in particular, travel to rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa (particularly West Africa); contact with suspected cases, healthcare facilities, rats or wild animals  raises  the  index  of  suspicion.  Symptoms  and  signs  vary according to pathogen, with bleeding in  advanced  cases.  Although rare, these infections can be severe and have implications for nosocomial transmission. Malaria must be excluded; however, PCR of blood may be required, before further investigations (which might result in exposure of healthcare staff) are performed.

This is based on the chronic, progressive spastic paraparesis with a thoracic sensory level in a patient from a TB-endemic region who is also HIV-positive. The diagnosis is strongly supported by the spinal radiograph showing collapse of the T11 vertebral body and a paravertebral soft tissue mass, which are characteristic findings. Schistosomiasis was ruled out with negative stool and urine tests, and the insidious onset made acute transverse myelitis less likely.\\nVitals: On a visit three months after symptom onset, his temperature was slightly elevated at 37.5 °C (99.5 °F). Upon admission to the tertiary hospital, he was afebrile with normal vital signs.\\nContent: The illness began one year prior with back pain. Over the following weeks, he developed difficulty walking and a 'pins and needles' sensation in his legs. Three months after onset, he presented to a health centre with a temperature of 37.5 °C and was given antimalarials and praziquantel. He also consulted a traditional healer.

The patient denies constitutional symptoms such as fever, night sweats, weight loss, or chronic cough. He has no haematuria or diarrhoea and is continent for stool and urine.\\n---\\n[MEDICAL HISTORY AND EXAMINATION]\\nContent: Within  endemic  areas,  schistosomiasis  must  be  suspected  in  all patients presenting any symptom, however vague, that can be related to the infection. In travelers and migrants, a careful residence or travel history can help establish the diagnosis of schistosomiasis [31, 33]. In several sub-Saharan areas, both S. mansoni and S. haematobium, and even S. intercalatum, can be contracted. The patient who has lived in,\\n877\\nor  visited,  endemic  areas  must  be  asked  about  skin  contact  with freshwater of any kind, even if considered locally as safe or snail-free. Contacts of any type or duration can lead to infection. The patient may, or may not, report itching or rash shortly after the water contact. Visual  inspection  may help  diagnose  'swimmers'  itch'  after  recent exposure.\\nA medical history may reveal intermittent symptoms since the potential exposure, including flu-like syndromes in the weeks or months thereafter. Malaise, fatigue,  muscle pains, appetite loss, intermittent diarrhea, vague abdominal pain and red or dark urine are potential warning signs - partly depending on the suspected species. A neurologic history and examination is performed to exclude early cerebrospinal involvement.

This was confirmed by serological testing showing a positive Mayaro IgM-IFA (1280 on 29 August, 40 on 12 September) and IgG-IFA (2560 on both dates) with a confirmatory plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) that rose from 40 to 160. The diagnosis aligns with the patient's travel history to the Amazon Basin, the preceding dengue-like febrile illness, and the characteristic prolonged symmetrical polyarthralgias primarily affecting small peripheral joints, while other common travel-related viral and bacterial causes were ruled out by serology.\\nVitals: No specific vital signs were reported other than the occurrence of an acute febrile illness with chills.\\nContent: During the second week of a 3.5-week trip to the Amazon Basin of northern Peru, the patient developed an acute febrile illness with chills, malaise, frontal headache, generalized myalgia, and a transient, non-pruritic maculopapular rash. The rash began on the forearms about 1 week after fever onset, spread to the trunk, neck, and face, and faded after 3 days. Slowly progressive, debilitating polyarthralgias affecting peripheral joints, with transient joint swelling, also developed. Painful cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy lasted for about 1 week. Fever and other acute symptoms subsided within 1 week, but polyarthralgias persisted, showing a symmetrical pattern mainly affecting the small joints of the hands and feet, wrists, ankles, and knees. Upon return to Switzerland a few weeks later, the patient reported stiffness of the affected joints, mainly in the morning and after immobility, and the joint pains did not improve for two more months.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: African tick-bite fever\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is African tick-bite fever, caused by Rickettsia africae. This was a clinical diagnosis based on the patient's presentation with fever after travel to an endemic area in Southern Africa, and the pathognomonic finding of an inoculation eschar with regional lymphadenitis. The primary differential of malaria was ruled out with negative blood tests. The patient's rapid clinical improvement on doxycycline therapy further supported the diagnosis.\\nVitals: On presentation, after taking 1g of paracetamol, his tympanic temperature was 37.5 °C (99.5 °F), pulse was 80 bpm, and blood pressure was 130/70 mmHg.\\nContent: A 52-year-old man presented to a tropical medicine clinic with a two-day history of fever, night sweats, and a frontal headache. The symptoms began ten days after he returned from a trip to South Africa. He denied any joint pains and had not noticed a rash. He did report having a skin lesion on his left upper thigh which he had covered with a plaster.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Rabies\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was paralytic rabies, caused by the rabies lyssavirus. This was confirmed by the detection of rabies viral RNA through RT-PCR in a saliva sample collected at admission. The diagnosis was strongly supported by the patient's history of a WHO category III stray dog bite in a rabies-endemic country, the rapidly progressive febrile quadriparesis, the development of autonomic instability, and the critical omission of rabies immunoglobulin during post-exposure prophylaxis. The clinical course and confirmatory laboratory test ruled out other neurological conditions considered in the differential.\\nVitals: On admission, his blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, pulse 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute, and temperature 38.5°C (101.3°F).\\nContent: A 20-year-old man presented with fever for 4 days, followed by tingling and weakness that began in his left leg and then rapidly progressed to involve all four limbs over the next 2 days. The onset of symptoms occurred about one month after a stray dog bite. After admission, he developed autonomic instability, evidenced by increased perspiration and significant variability in heart rate and blood pressure. He also developed dysphagia and respiratory distress, requiring mechanical ventilation on the third day after hospitalization. The patient died due to sudden cardiac arrest on the fifth day of hospitalization, which was nine days post-onset of symptoms.\\n---\\n[TRENCH FEVER]\\nContent: Trench  fever  is  an  acute  disease  characterized  by  sudden  onset  of high-grade fever, headaches, dizziness, and a characteristic pain in the shins. Dizziness and headaches are sometime so sudden that soldiers have been known to fall over in the trenches. Other symptoms include post-orbital  pain  (typically  exacerbated by movement), pain in  the lower limbs and back, constipation, a rash on the face, and a loss of appetite [12]. The first episode of fever may last 2-4 days and may be followed  by  relapses  every  4-6  days,  giving  rise  to  trench  fever's\\nFIGURE  67. 1 Body  louse,  a  vector  for B.  quintana ,  sucking  blood  on  a homeless patient.\\nFIGURE 67. 2 Pediculosis and super infection in a homeless man seeking care during a snapshot intervention in shelters.

Although trench fever often results in prolonged disability, it is rarely fatal.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Spinal tuberculosis (Pott's disease)\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is presumed spinal tuberculosis (Pott's disease). This is based on the chronic, progressive spastic paraparesis with a thoracic sensory level in a patient from a TB-endemic region who is also HIV-positive. The diagnosis is strongly supported by the spinal radiograph showing collapse of the T11 vertebral body and a paravertebral soft tissue mass, which are characteristic findings. Schistosomiasis was ruled out with negative stool and urine tests, and the insidious onset made acute transverse myelitis less likely.\\nVitals: On a visit three months after symptom onset, his temperature was slightly elevated at 37.5 °C (99.5 °F). Upon admission to the tertiary hospital, he was afebrile with normal vital signs.\\nContent: The illness began one year prior with back pain. Over the following weeks, he developed difficulty walking and a 'pins and needles' sensation in his legs. Three months after onset, he presented to a health centre with a temperature of 37.5 °C and was given antimalarials and praziquantel. He also consulted a traditional healer. His condition progressively deteriorated over the next six months, eventually leaving him bedridden. The patient denies constitutional symptoms such as fever, night sweats, weight loss, or chronic cough. He has no haematuria or diarrhoea and is continent for stool and urine.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

This was confirmed by the presence of a high load of S. stercoralis rhabditiform larvae in both stool (via Baermann testing) and respiratory secretions, following initial suspicion from a duodenal biopsy. The diagnosis is supported by the clinical presentation of severe chronic diarrhoea and wasting, the patient's origin from an endemic area for both pathogens, confirmed HTLV-1 co-infection (a known risk factor for hyperinfection), and the excellent clinical and parasitological response to ivermectin therapy.\\nVitals: The patient was afebrile on examination. No other vital signs were reported.\\nContent: A 34-year-old male immigrant from northern Peru, living in Chile for 9 years. He is described as cachectic with a BMI of 17. His HIV test was negative. There is a significant family history where his mother and one brother suffered from chronic abdominal symptoms of unknown origin, leading to wasting and death at ages 45 and 28, respectively.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Persistent infection in immunocompromised persons may progress from  asymptomatic  to  symptomatic  as  immune  status  declines. Biliary tract  involvement  may  lead  to  clinical  cholangitis  [16] and respiratory disease, to mild hypoxia and shortness of breath [13, 16]. Respiratory infection has been considered a rare HIV/AIDS complication, but recent data suggest it may be common in normal children with enteric infection, suggesting that respiratory transmission may  occur.  In  persons  with  HIV/AIDS,  cryptosporidiosis  causes increased mortality and shortened survival [22]. In people with the cholera-like form of the disease characterized by massive fluid loss, severe  abdominal  pain,  malabsorption,  anorexia  and  significant weight loss, survival may only be for days or several weeks. To summarize, variations in immune status and the extent and sites of infection contribute to differences in disease severity and survival [17, 18], as may the species of the parasite [1 1].\\n---\\n[HIV AND THE LIVER 8TABLE 4-59]\\nContent: The majority of people infected with HIV live in the lower-income world (see Chapter 27). HIV is associated with a number of specific diseases of the liver related to immunosuppression, immune reconstitution and drug effects. Broadly, the spectrum of liver disease relates to  CD4  count  and  antiretroviral  therapy  (ART)  exposure.  In  areas where ART is available, the burden of disease has shifted from opportunistic  infection  and  malignancy  to  chronic  diseases,  with  liver disease related to viral hepatitis becoming a leading cause of morbidity and mortality [30]. Chronic viral hepatitis and HIV co-infection is associated with reduced spontaneous clearance and accelerated progression of viral hepatitis to cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma [31]. However, in those who do not have access to ART, opportunistic infection and malignancy are still prevalent. Most conditions associated with liver disease are systemic and have  spread  hematogenously  from  other  sites  to  involve  the  liver. These can be stratified by CD4 count, as most serious opportunistic infections  (OIs)  occur  with  severe  immunodeficiency  (CD4 < 100 cells/ μ L).  However,  tuberculosis,  non-Hodgkin  lymphoma  (NHL)\\n---\\n[KEY FEATURES]\\nContent: - Hepatobiliary abnormalities are common in resource limited and tropical settings\\n- Liver disease can be divided into: 'pre-hepatic', involving the portal vein or hepatic artery; 'hepatic', involving the parenchymal lobule, including hepatocytes, biliary and vascular sinusoids; and 'post-hepatic', involving the hepatic vein or biliary systems\\n- Characterizing liver abnormalities involves a combination of clinical, biochemical, serologic, microbiologic, radiologic and histologic investigations\\n- Hepatitis is common, and most frequently due to viral infections and toxins\\n- Parasitic infection of the liver may be seen during echinococcosis, schistosomiasis and liver *uke infection, among other processes\\n- Many tropical diseases may result in cholestasis and jaundice, through varied mechanisms\\n- Focal liver diseases may be due to infection or neoplasia\\n- Hepatitis B and hepatitis C can lead to chronic liver disease, especially in setting of HIV co-infection\\n- Chronic liver disease can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, and cancer\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: The  course  of  HEV  infection  is  similar  to  that  of  hepatitis  A.  The incubation  period  averages  40  days  (range  15-60  days).  After  oral inoculation, the virus principally replicates in the liver and produces cytopathic  changes.  HEV  can  be  detected  in  stool  and  blood  3-4 weeks after ingestion, prior to the onset of symptoms, and for 1-2 weeks afterwards. Like hepatitis A, there are many more asymptomatic and anicteric infections with HEV than diagnosed cases of acute viral hepatitis.  Children  often  have  asymptomatic,  anicteric  infections, while the clinical attack rate is higher in the 15-40 year age group, and severity of illness increases with age.\\nSymptoms and signs are similar to those caused by other types of viral hepatitis: malaise, fatigue,  anorexia,  nausea  and  vomiting, jaundice and dark urine, abdominal pain, fever and hepatomegaly. The most common  laboratory  findings  include  elevated  bilirubin,  ALT,  AST, and alkaline phosphatase. Histopathologic findings in biopsies from patients with HEV hepatitis have included both cholestatic hepatitis and classic acute viral hepatitis changes.\\nClinical  symptoms,  hyperbilirubinemia  and  elevated  aminotransferase levels generally resolve 1-6 weeks after onset of illness. Jaundice may be prolonged with HEV infection, which may also cause fulminant hepatitis; 10-20% of pregnant women in the third trimester who are hospitalized with acute HEV infection during outbreaks in India were  reported  to  have  fatal  fulminant  hepatitis  [107,  108].  HEV very  rarely  causes  chronic  infection  in  immunosuppressed  patients [109, 1 10].\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

Toxin-induced  secretory  diarrhea  continues  independent  of  food intake. Malabsorption of carbohydrate in the small intestine leads to fermentation of unabsorbed substrates by colonic bacteria; this may cause bloating, the passage of much rectal gas and frothy stools, which are all characteristic of giardiasis. Cryptosporidiosis can involve both small and large bowel, causing short-lived and self-limiting diarrhea; however, the infection can be prolonged in patients with impaired immune responses. Cyclospora cayetanensis can also cause  acute and more chronic diarrhea with abnormalities of intestinal absorption.\\nFrequent  bowel  movements  with  small  volumes  of  stool  and  the passage  of  blood  and  mucus  suggest  colonic  infection.  Causes  of bloody diarrhea (dysentery) include invasive bacteria such as Campylobacter spp., enterohemorrhagic E. coli , and Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia spp.; nonbacterial causes include Entamoeba histolytica (amebic dysentery) and Balantidium coli , which is spread by close contact with pigs. Colicky abdominal pain is common in many gut infections and is especially severe in campylobacteriosis and yersiniosis, mimicking acute appendicitis.

He also reports feeling feverish, has redness in his eyes, and has observed small red spots on his skin. He has no known pre-existing conditions. What could be causing these symptoms?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: African tick-bite fever\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is African tick-bite fever, caused by Rickettsia africae. This was a clinical diagnosis based on the patient's presentation with fever after travel to an endemic area in Southern Africa, and the pathognomonic finding of an inoculation eschar with regional lymphadenitis. The primary differential of malaria was ruled out with negative blood tests. The patient's rapid clinical improvement on doxycycline therapy further supported the diagnosis.\\nVitals: On presentation, after taking 1g of paracetamol, his tympanic temperature was 37.5 °C (99.5 °F), pulse was 80 bpm, and blood pressure was 130/70 mmHg.\\nContent: A 52-year-old man presented to a tropical medicine clinic with a two-day history of fever, night sweats, and a frontal headache. The symptoms began ten days after he returned from a trip to South Africa. He denied any joint pains and had not noticed a rash. He did report having a skin lesion on his left upper thigh which he had covered with a plaster.\\n---\\n[SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS]\\nContent: Typically, the disease begins with the abrupt onset of intense headache, fever, chills, and myalgia. Fever often exceeds 40°C (103°F) and is preceded by rigors. Muscle pain can be excruciating and occurs most commonly in the thighs, calves, lumbosacral region, and abdomen. Abdominal  wall  pain  accompanied  by  palpation  tenderness  can mimic an acute surgical abdomen. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and sore throat are other frequent symptoms. Cough and chest pain figure prominently in reports of patients from Korea and China.\\nConjunctival suffusion is a helpful diagnostic clue that usually appears two  or  three  days  after  the  onset  of  fever  and  involves  the  bulbar conjunctiva.  Pus  and  serous  secretions  are  absent  and  there  is  no matting  of  the  eyelashes  and  eyelids.  Mild  suffusion  can  easily  be overlooked. Less common and less distinctive signs include pharyngeal injection, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and skin  lesions.  Within  a  week,  most  patients  become  asymptomatic. After several days of apparent recovery, the illness resumes in some individuals. Manifestations of the second stage are more variable and mild than those of the initial illness and usually last 2-4 days. Leptospires  disappear  from  the  blood,  cerebrospinal  fluid  (CSF),  and tissues, but appear in the urine. Serum antibody titers rise - hence the term  'immune'  phase.  Meningitis  is  the  hallmark  of  this  stage  of leptospirosis. Pleocytosis of the CSF can be demonstrated in 80-90% of all patients during the second week of illness, although only about 50% will have clinical signs and symptoms of meningitis. Meningeal signs can last several weeks, but usually resolve within a day or two. Uveitis  is  a  late  manifestation  of  leptospirosis,  generally  seen  4-8 months after the illness has begun. The anterior uveal tract is most frequently affected and pain, photophobia, and blurring of vision are the usual symptoms.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Rabies\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was paralytic rabies, caused by the rabies lyssavirus. This was confirmed by the detection of rabies viral RNA through RT-PCR in a saliva sample collected at admission. The diagnosis was strongly supported by the patient's history of a WHO category III stray dog bite in a rabies-endemic country, the rapidly progressive febrile quadriparesis, the development of autonomic instability, and the critical omission of rabies immunoglobulin during post-exposure prophylaxis. The clinical course and confirmatory laboratory test ruled out other neurological conditions considered in the differential.\\nVitals: On admission, his blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, pulse 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute, and temperature 38.5°C (101.3°F).\\nContent: A 20-year-old man presented with fever for 4 days, followed by tingling and weakness that began in his left leg and then rapidly progressed to involve all four limbs over the next 2 days. The onset of symptoms occurred about one month after a stray dog bite. After admission, he developed autonomic instability, evidenced by increased perspiration and significant variability in heart rate and blood pressure. He also developed dysphagia and respiratory distress, requiring mechanical ventilation on the third day after hospitalization. The patient died due to sudden cardiac arrest on the fifth day of hospitalization, which was nine days post-onset of symptoms.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Spinal tuberculosis (Pott's disease)\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is presumed spinal tuberculosis (Pott's disease). This is based on the chronic, progressive spastic paraparesis with a thoracic sensory level in a patient from a TB-endemic region who is also HIV-positive. The diagnosis is strongly supported by the spinal radiograph showing collapse of the T11 vertebral body and a paravertebral soft tissue mass, which are characteristic findings. Schistosomiasis was ruled out with negative stool and urine tests, and the insidious onset made acute transverse myelitis less likely.\\nVitals: On a visit three months after symptom onset, his temperature was slightly elevated at 37.5 °C (99.5 °F). Upon admission to the tertiary hospital, he was afebrile with normal vital signs.\\nContent: The illness began one year prior with back pain. Over the following weeks, he developed difficulty walking and a 'pins and needles' sensation in his legs. Three months after onset, he presented to a health centre with a temperature of 37.5 °C and was given antimalarials and praziquantel. He also consulted a traditional healer. His condition progressively deteriorated over the next six months, eventually leaving him bedridden. The patient denies constitutional symptoms such as fever, night sweats, weight loss, or chronic cough. He has no haematuria or diarrhoea and is continent for stool and urine.\\n---\\n[TRENCH FEVER]\\nContent: Trench  fever  is  an  acute  disease  characterized  by  sudden  onset  of high-grade fever, headaches, dizziness, and a characteristic pain in the shins. Dizziness and headaches are sometime so sudden that soldiers have been known to fall over in the trenches. Other symptoms include post-orbital  pain  (typically  exacerbated by movement), pain in  the lower limbs and back, constipation, a rash on the face, and a loss of appetite [12]. The first episode of fever may last 2-4 days and may be followed  by  relapses  every  4-6  days,  giving  rise  to  trench  fever's\\nFIGURE  67. 1 Body  louse,  a  vector  for B.  quintana ,  sucking  blood  on  a homeless patient.\\nFIGURE 67. 2 Pediculosis and super infection in a homeless man seeking care during a snapshot intervention in shelters.

Fever may gradually increase over the first week of illness. Headache, anorexia, malaise, and other nonspecific,  flu-like  symptoms  are  common  and  may  precede  fever. Abdominal complaints  including  diarrhea,  constipation,  and  nonlocalizing abdominal pain each occur in less than a third of cases, but may raise clinical suspicion [16].\\nPhysical findings are also nonspecific. Relative bradycardia, or pulsetemperature dissociation, is considered a classic sign of enteric fever, but there is no widely accepted definition of relative bradycardia and little evidence that it is a useful predictor [17]. Rose spots are small, blanching pink macular lesions, typically 2-4 mm, that usually occur on the chest, abdomen and/or back during the second week of illness, but are infrequently observed. A white, yellow or brown coating of the tongue that spares the tongue's edges is common. Mild abdominal tenderness may be present. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, if present, are usually modest.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Tuberculous Lymphadenitis with Paradoxical IRIS\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was tuberculous lymphadenitis with superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis, complicated by paradoxical immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).

For those with clinical disease, the incubation period is usually 3-6 days. In its mildest form, yellow fever is a self-limited infection characterized by acute onset of fever and headache. A subset of patients experience other symptoms, including chills, myalgias, lumbosacral pain, anorexia, nausea, vomiting and dizziness [3]. Physical examination may demonstrate  relative  bradycardia  in  relation  to  elevated  body temperature (Faget's sign). The patient is usually viremic during this period, which lasts for approximately 3 days. Most have an uneventful recovery but, in approximately 15% of cases, the illness recurs in a more  severe  form  within  48  hours  following  the  viremic  period. Symptoms  include  fever,  vomiting,  epigastric  pain,  jaundice,  renal insufficiency  and  cardiovascular  instability.  The  virus  is  generally absent from the blood during this phase of symptom recrudescence. A bleeding diathesis with hematemesis, melena, metrorrhagia, hematuria, petechiae, ecchymoses and epistaxis.

A  high\\nFIGURE 33.7.1 Rift  Valley  fever  geographic distribution. Countries  highlighted in dark blue have periodic widespread epidemics of human and/ or  livestock  disease.  Countries  highlighted  in  mid-blue  have  occasional reports of Rift Valley fever virus infection.\\nproportion of patients report nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea;  symptoms can  clinically  resemble  other  acute  viral  infections, thus complicating early differential diagnosis [8]. (Fig. 33.7.2, Table 33.7-1). Upper respiratory signs are notably absent in Rift Valley fever cases. A small percentage of infected individuals (1-2%), may develop  jaundice,  hepatitis,  and/or  a  hemorrhagic  syndrome.  Case fatalities among hospitalized patients with coagulopathy range from 10-30%. In some patients, retinitis may develop with potential longterm sequelae including scotomas, other vision abnormalities or total blindness [9]. In the largest reported study of laboratory-confirmed hospitalized  patients  (n = 683,  Saudi  Arabia  2000-2001)  hemorrhagic complications included: thrombocytopenia (38.4%); hematemesis  (3.6%);  petechiae  (2.8%);  melena  (1.8%);  epistaxis  (1.2%); excessive  bleeding  from  puncture  sites  (2.4%);  and  disseminated intravascular coagulation with multiple organ dysfunction, including renal failure (7.5%) [10]. Laboratory abnormalities included marked elevations  of  serum  transaminases  [aspartate  transaminase  (AST), alanine  transaminase  (ALT),  gamma-glutamyl  transferase  (GGT)], lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) and creatinine with moderate-to-severe anemia and marked thrombocytopenia.  High  virus  loads  (mean  titer, > 1.0  X  10 6 plaque-forming units/mL  of  blood)  are  significantly  linked  to  fatal  outcomes  [1 1]. Resolution  of  the  acute  phase  can  be  followed  7-28  days  later  by delayed-onset encephalitis.\\n---\\n[ROCKY MOUNTAIN SPOTTED FEVER]\\nContent: Around one week after being bitten by an infected tick, the disease begins with fever, chills, myalgia and headache. During the next few days,  these  symptoms continue and may be  accompanied  by anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, photophobia and cough. The fever is typically high (39-41°C) and associated with a severe  frontal  headache.  Rash,  considered  the  hallmark  feature  of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, appears on day three of fever as small, pink,  blanching  macules  (typically  on  the  wrists,  ankles  and  forearms) that evolve maculopapules. Within 24 hours, it spreads centrally to involve the legs, buttocks, arms, axillae, trunk, neck and face. The entire body may be involved, including the mucous membranes of the palate and pharynx [1 1]. Characteristic of the rash are petechial lesions,  in  a  distribution  that  includes  the  palms  and  soles,  which occur in 36% to 82% of patients. In some severe cases, petechiae may coalesce to form large ecchymoses. No eschar at the inoculation site is visible. Severe manifestations may include pulmonary edema and hemorrhage, cerebral edema, myocarditis, renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and gangrene. Three factors are independent predictors of failure by the physician to initiate therapy the first time a patient is seen: absence of a rash, presentation between August 1 and April 30, and presentation within the first three days of illness. In untreated patients who survive their illness, the natural course of fever terminates after two to three weeks.\\n---\\n[FINAL DIAGNOSIS]\\nDisease: Yellow Fever\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was Yellow Fever, caused by a flavivirus, confirmed by a highly positive IgM capture ELISA for yellow fever (1:10000). This diagnosis aligned with his acute febrile illness, jaundice, bleeding, encephalopathy, seizures, liver failure, and occupation as a logger in an endemic Peruvian jungle area, coupled with his unvaccinated status. The sudden drop in liver transaminases prior to death was indicative of acute hepatic disintegration.

It  erupts  as  weals  with  visible puncta and progresses to papules surmounted by vesicles or bullae that may become excoriated and infected. It is associated with chronic superficial infestations by fleas (e.g. cat fleas Ctenocephalides felis ) and bedbugs (see below), and with bites by mosquitoes, mites and other arthropods [2, 3].\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Chikungunya is an acute infection of abrupt onset, heralded by fever and severe arthralgia, and followed by other constitutional symptoms and rash lasting for a period of 1-7 days. The incubation period is usually 2-3 days, with a range of 1-12 days. Fever rises abruptly, often reaching 39-40°C accompanied by intermittent shaking chills. This acute phase lasts 2-3 days. The temperature may remit for 1-2 days after a gap of 4-10 days, resulting in a 'saddle back' fever curve that is characteristic of arthropod-borne virus infections.\\nThe arthralgias are polyarticular, migratory and predominantly affect the small joints of the hands, wrists, ankles and feet (Fig. 32.2.2) with lesser involvement of larger joints. During the acute phase, patients complain bitterly of pain when asked to move. They characteristically lie still in the attitude of flexion. Pain on movement is worse in the morning, improved by mild exercise and exacerbated by strenuous exercise. Swelling may occur but fluid accumulation is uncommon. Patients with milder articular manifestation are usually symptom-free within a few weeks, but more severe cases require months to resolve entirely [1, 3]. A study indicated that over 12% of patients develop chronic joint symptoms. Generalized myalgias, as well as back and shoulder pain is common [4].\\nCutaneous  manifestations  are  typical  with  many  patients.  Initially, many present with facial and trunk flushing. This is usually followed by a maculopapular rash. The trunk and limbs are commonly involved (Fig. 32.2.3), but the face, palms and soles may also show lesions. The rash may simply fade or desquamate. Petechiae may occur alone or in association with the rash.\\nDuring the acute phase, most patients will have headache, but it is not  usually  severe.  Photophobia  and  retro-orbital  pain  may  also\\nFIGURE 32.2.2 Maculopapular rash on lower extremities (A) and upper extremities (B) in cases of chikungunya fever.\\nFIGURE 32.2.3 Swelling of ankle joints (A) and small joints of hands (B) in cases of chikungunya fever.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Mayaro fever\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was Mayaro fever, caused by Mayaro virus (MAYV). This was confirmed by serological testing showing a positive Mayaro IgM-IFA (1280 on 29 August, 40 on 12 September) and IgG-IFA (2560 on both dates) with a confirmatory plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) that rose from 40 to 160. The diagnosis aligns with the patient's travel history to the Amazon Basin, the preceding dengue-like febrile illness, and the characteristic prolonged symmetrical polyarthralgias primarily affecting small peripheral joints, while other common travel-related viral and bacterial causes were ruled out by serology.\\nVitals: No specific vital signs were reported other than the occurrence of an acute febrile illness with chills.\\nContent: During the second week of a 3.5-week trip to the Amazon Basin of northern Peru, the patient developed an acute febrile illness with chills, malaise, frontal headache, generalized myalgia, and a transient, non-pruritic maculopapular rash. The rash began on the forearms about 1 week after fever onset, spread to the trunk, neck, and face, and faded after 3 days. Slowly progressive, debilitating polyarthralgias affecting peripheral joints, with transient joint swelling, also developed. Painful cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy lasted for about 1 week. Fever and other acute symptoms subsided within 1 week, but polyarthralgias persisted, showing a symmetrical pattern mainly affecting the small joints of the hands and feet, wrists, ankles, and knees. Upon return to Switzerland a few weeks later, the patient reported stiffness of the affected joints, mainly in the morning and after immobility, and the joint pains did not improve for two more months.\\n---\\n[FOOT INFECTIONS]\\nContent: Athlete's  foot or  tinea  pedis  is  a  term  used  to  describe  scaling  and maceration accompanied by itching between the toes, particularly the fourth  interdigital  space.  It  is  a  syndrome  that  may  be  caused  by Candida species, erythrasma or Gram-negative bacteria, as well as by dermatophytes. In dermatophyte infections, the area between the toes may be wet or dry and, in some infections, particularly those caused by Trichophyton interdigitale , vesicular. Involvement of the dorsum of the foot or the sole may occur. The commonest cause is T. rubrum .\\nSymptoms may be minimal. It is more common in people who wear shoes and socks and is therefore associated with urban areas in the tropics.\\nTinea pedis in tropical areas must be distinguished from eczema and, less commonly, plantar psoriasis [4]. The interplay between bacteria and fungi is poorly understood but, in the tropics, secondary Gramnegative bacterial infection on top of interdigital dermatophytosis can occur.\\n---\\n[FIXED LOCALIZED PAPULES AND NODULES]\\nContent: There are several causes of fixed papules and nodules (Box 147.3). Myiasis  and  tungiasis  are  among  the  most  common.  Myiasis  is infestation of human tissue by larvae or maggots of flies ( Diptera ).

The initial diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis was confirmed by an AFB-positive fine-needle aspirate from a neck gland. The paradoxical IRIS was diagnosed clinically based on his worsening condition after starting ART, despite evidence of a good virologic and immunologic response. The superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis, likely with Staphylococcus aureus, was confirmed by the second aspirate showing purulent material with coccoid bacteria and the patient's rapid improvement following incision, drainage, and antibiotics.\\nVitals: On presentation, he was febrile with a temperature of 39.2 °C (102.56° F).

This clinical diagnosis is based on the patient's generalized maculopapular rash with extensive mucous membrane involvement (oral, conjunctival, genital), which appeared approximately four weeks after starting nevirapine and co-trimoxazole, both of which are highly implicated drugs. The diagnosis is further supported by the much higher incidence of SJS in HIV-positive individuals. Infectious causes like malaria were ruled out with negative testing.\\nVitals: Temperature is 37.7°C (99.9°F), blood pressure is 120/68 mmHg, pulse is 90 bpm, and respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute.\\nContent: The patient developed a productive cough with whitish sputum, followed one day later by a generalized skin rash that started on her trunk and spread to the extremities and mucosal membranes. Over the past two days, she also developed a sore throat and dysuria. The rash involves her lips, oral mucosa, conjunctivae, and genital mucosa, and has made talking and eating difficult and painful.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Infection usually results from exposure to respiratory secretions from cases or carriers, or exudates from cutaneous lesions. The incubation period is usually from 1-5 days, but occasionally can be longer. The frequency and severity of clinical symptoms and signs depend on the site  of  infection,  size  of  the  pseudomembrane  and  the  patient's immunization history.  However,  regardless  of  the  site  of  infection, systemic manifestations are similar and consequent to absorption of diphtheria toxin from these sites. The disease is usually localized to mucous membrane in the upper respiratory tract, the skin, or both. Symptoms and signs can develop at multiple sites in the upper respiratory tract, including the nose, pharynx, tonsils and larynx [5]. The characteristic feature of diphtheria is the formation of a tough, dirtygray, leather-like pseudomembrane at the site of infection.\\nThe most common site for respiratory diphtheria is the faucial area including  the  posterior  pharynx,  soft  palate,  periglottal  area,  uvula and tonsillar mucosa (Fig. 37.2). The onset is usually insidious and patients usually present with a low-grade fever ( < 103°F), sore throat, pain on swallowing, hoarseness of voice, pharyngeal injection, nasal discharge, cough, malaise and prostration [5, 6]. The pulse is usually more rapid than the fever would justify. On initial examination, the pharynx is injected, but patches of exudates may appear a day after illness onset. These patches may expand and coalesce to form a whiteto-dirty-gray,  tenacious  membrane  over  one  or  both  tonsils,  the nasopharynx, uvula and soft palate, and can extend downward into the larynx and trachea. The edge of the membrane is surrounded by a narrow zone of erythema and a broader zone of mucosal edema. Cervical lymph nodes are usually tender and enlarged and, along with cervical soft tissue edema, gives rise to the so-called bull-neck appearance and may cause respiratory stridor. Extension of the pseudomembrane from the pharynx to the larynx can result in life-threatening airway obstruction.\\n---\\n[CHIEF COMPLAINT]\\nDisease: Human Monkeypox\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was human monkeypox. This was a clinical diagnosis based on the patient's acute febrile illness, accompanied by a disseminated, uniform vesiculopustular skin rash involving the face, palms, soles, and oral mucosa, along with prominent generalized and cervical lymphadenopathy. This presentation is highly characteristic of monkeypox and distinguishes it from alternative diagnoses such as varicella, which typically presents with a heterogeneous rash and less prominent lymphadenopathy.\\nVitals: Temperature 38 °C (100.4 °F), pulse 110 beats per minute, blood pressure 105/82 mmHg.\\nContent: Acute febrile illness accompanied by malaise, headache, dry cough, neck swelling, and a disseminated skin rash, which appeared 2 days after initial symptoms.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Group A Streptococcus pharyngitis may be mild or associated with high fever,  tender  anterior  cervical  lymphadenopathy,  tonsillar  exudates and raised peripheral white cell count. Symptoms usually resolve after 3-5  days,  although  suppurative  complications  (which  are  now uncommon in industrialized settings) include peritonsillar and retropharyngeal  abscess,  suppurative  lymphadenitis,  otitis  media,  mastoiditis and  meningitis. Non-suppurative  complications  include scarlet fever, acute rheumatic fever or acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Scarlet fever is characterized by a diffuse blanching rash that spreads from the chest to the abdomen and extremities leaving a  sandpaper-like  texture  to  the  skin.  Desquamation  of  the  fingers, toes, groin and axilla occurs one or more weeks later. The tongue is frequently coated in a white film (white strawberry tongue) that eventually gives way to a beefy red appearance (red strawberry tongue). While most cases are benign, scarlet fever was often lethal in the preantibiotic era. Many cases likely represented what would be regarded today as streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS).\\nIn simple impetigo, infection is confined to the epidermis with the formation of superficial crusted lesions on the face or other exposed body  parts.  In  tropical  and  impoverished  settings  'pyodermatous' lesions may be pustular and ulcerative. Children are usually afebrile and otherwise well, although resolution of pyoderma may take many days and result in scarring. Erysipelas, which typically affects the face or  an  extremity,  is  a  painful  infection  of  the  dermis  resulting  in  a clearly  demarcated  red  and  raised  area  of  inflammation  and  often formation of superficial bullae. Cellulitis involves the deeper subcutaneous tissues  causing  a  more  diffuse  and  less  clearly  demarcated area of inflammation. Infection of the draining lymphatic tracts (lymphangitis) results in tender linear streaks extending from the site of infection. Unlike impetigo, cellulitis and erysipelas are usually associated with fever and systemic toxicity.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

During this period, he also developed a painful swelling in his neck. He has no other reported symptoms.\\n---\\n[MILD ILLNESS]\\nContent: Enteric fever is usually insidious. Fever may gradually increase over the first week of illness. Headache, anorexia, malaise, and other nonspecific,  flu-like  symptoms  are  common  and  may  precede  fever. Abdominal complaints  including  diarrhea,  constipation,  and  nonlocalizing abdominal pain each occur in less than a third of cases, but may raise clinical suspicion [16].\\nPhysical findings are also nonspecific. Relative bradycardia, or pulsetemperature dissociation, is considered a classic sign of enteric fever, but there is no widely accepted definition of relative bradycardia and little evidence that it is a useful predictor [17]. Rose spots are small, blanching pink macular lesions, typically 2-4 mm, that usually occur on the chest, abdomen and/or back during the second week of illness, but are infrequently observed. A white, yellow or brown coating of the tongue that spares the tongue's edges is common. Mild abdominal tenderness may be present. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, if present, are usually modest.\\n---\\n[SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS]\\nContent: Typically, the disease begins with the abrupt onset of intense headache, fever, chills, and myalgia. Fever often exceeds 40°C (103°F) and is preceded by rigors. Muscle pain can be excruciating and occurs most commonly in the thighs, calves, lumbosacral region, and abdomen. Abdominal  wall  pain  accompanied  by  palpation  tenderness  can mimic an acute surgical abdomen. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and sore throat are other frequent symptoms. Cough and chest pain figure prominently in reports of patients from Korea and China.\\nConjunctival suffusion is a helpful diagnostic clue that usually appears two  or  three  days  after  the  onset  of  fever  and  involves  the  bulbar conjunctiva.  Pus  and  serous  secretions  are  absent  and  there  is  no matting  of  the  eyelashes  and  eyelids.  Mild  suffusion  can  easily  be overlooked. Less common and less distinctive signs include pharyngeal injection, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and skin  lesions.  Within  a  week,  most  patients  become  asymptomatic. After several days of apparent recovery, the illness resumes in some individuals. Manifestations of the second stage are more variable and mild than those of the initial illness and usually last 2-4 days. Leptospires  disappear  from  the  blood,  cerebrospinal  fluid  (CSF),  and tissues, but appear in the urine. Serum antibody titers rise - hence the term  'immune'  phase.  Meningitis  is  the  hallmark  of  this  stage  of leptospirosis. Pleocytosis of the CSF can be demonstrated in 80-90% of all patients during the second week of illness, although only about 50% will have clinical signs and symptoms of meningitis. Meningeal signs can last several weeks, but usually resolve within a day or two. Uveitis  is  a  late  manifestation  of  leptospirosis,  generally  seen  4-8 months after the illness has begun. The anterior uveal tract is most frequently affected and pain, photophobia, and blurring of vision are the usual symptoms.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

Involvement and abscess formation and edema can result in obstruction  (swallowing  and  breathing),  pain,  tenderness,  trismus and neck stiffness. Visible soft tissue swelling can result from infections  of  the  peritonsillar,  parapharyngeal,  parotid,  submandibular, suprahyoid, periauricular and masseteric spaces. Peritonsillar abscess formation, also known as Quinsy, presents with unilateral swelling of  the  soft  palate  above  the  tonsil.  Abscess  formation  beneath  the floor of the mouth, called Ludwig's angina, produces tense and tender swelling behind the chin and between the angles of the jaw. Vincent's angina, or trench mouth, presents with localized or multiple necrotic mucosal  ulcerations  and  foul  breath.  Retropharyngeal  and  retroesophageal abscesses produce dysphagia and neck rigidity. Mediastinal spread is a potential complication that can lead to sepsis; rupture may lead to respiratory obstruction.  Erosion of the  great vessels of the neck can lead to catastrophic hemorrhage. Soft tissue lateral views of  the  head  and  neck  may  aid  in  diagnosing  retropharyngeal  and retroesophageal abscesses. Purulent material that is drained or aspirated from deep neck abscesses should be submitted for culture and sensitivity studies and the results used to adjust the selection of antibiotics. Treatment  should include aggressive antibiotic therapy against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms (including anaerobes), prompt incision and drainage of abscesses, and adequate nutrition and fluid therapy. Respiratory obstruction should be proactively addressed with consideration of artificial airways.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Tetanus\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is tetanus.

The clinical course, with worsening spasms despite initial treatment, is characteristic of the disease as the toxin continues to affect the nervous system.\\nVitals: On initial presentation, her pulse, blood pressure, and respiratory rate were all within normal limits. No fever was reported.\\nContent: The patient developed difficulty chewing and stiffness of the mouth three days after arriving in Europe from her home in rural Ethiopia. She reported that this symptom had never occurred before. The initial symptom was trismus, which is a common early presentation for tetanus as the muscles of mastication have the shortest motor neurons.\\n---\\n[WOUND BOTULISM]\\nContent: Wound botulism follows the absorption of toxin produced by organisms contaminating a wound site, so clinical incubation periods are longer than for botulism caused by food which contains preformed toxin.  Cases  have  increased  in  developed  countries  in  recent  years, driven by an epidemic among injecting drug-users and strongly associated with the practice of injecting into the subcutaneous tissues or muscle, known as 'skin-' or 'muscle-popping' . The majority of cases occur  in  the  USA  [7].  Sporadic  cases  of  botulism  associated  with contaminated compound fractures are occasionally reported.\\n---\\n[FINAL DIAGNOSIS]\\nDisease: Tetanus\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is tetanus.

Is this just a flu or something related to being outdoors?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Mayaro fever\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was Mayaro fever, caused by Mayaro virus (MAYV). This was confirmed by serological testing showing a positive Mayaro IgM-IFA (1280 on 29 August, 40 on 12 September) and IgG-IFA (2560 on both dates) with a confirmatory plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) that rose from 40 to 160. The diagnosis aligns with the patient's travel history to the Amazon Basin, the preceding dengue-like febrile illness, and the characteristic prolonged symmetrical polyarthralgias primarily affecting small peripheral joints, while other common travel-related viral and bacterial causes were ruled out by serology.\\nVitals: No specific vital signs were reported other than the occurrence of an acute febrile illness with chills.\\nContent: During the second week of a 3.5-week trip to the Amazon Basin of northern Peru, the patient developed an acute febrile illness with chills, malaise, frontal headache, generalized myalgia, and a transient, non-pruritic maculopapular rash. The rash began on the forearms about 1 week after fever onset, spread to the trunk, neck, and face, and faded after 3 days. Slowly progressive, debilitating polyarthralgias affecting peripheral joints, with transient joint swelling, also developed. Painful cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy lasted for about 1 week. Fever and other acute symptoms subsided within 1 week, but polyarthralgias persisted, showing a symmetrical pattern mainly affecting the small joints of the hands and feet, wrists, ankles, and knees. Upon return to Switzerland a few weeks later, the patient reported stiffness of the affected joints, mainly in the morning and after immobility, and the joint pains did not improve for two more months.\\n---\\n[TRENCH FEVER]\\nContent: Trench  fever  is  an  acute  disease  characterized  by  sudden  onset  of high-grade fever, headaches, dizziness, and a characteristic pain in the shins. Dizziness and headaches are sometime so sudden that soldiers have been known to fall over in the trenches. Other symptoms include post-orbital  pain  (typically  exacerbated by movement), pain in  the lower limbs and back, constipation, a rash on the face, and a loss of appetite [12]. The first episode of fever may last 2-4 days and may be followed  by  relapses  every  4-6  days,  giving  rise  to  trench  fever's\\nFIGURE  67. 1 Body  louse,  a  vector  for B.  quintana ,  sucking  blood  on  a homeless patient.\\nFIGURE 67. 2 Pediculosis and super infection in a homeless man seeking care during a snapshot intervention in shelters.

During the next few days,  these  symptoms continue and may be  accompanied  by anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, photophobia and cough. The fever is typically high (39-41°C) and associated with a severe  frontal  headache.  Rash,  considered  the  hallmark  feature  of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, appears on day three of fever as small, pink,  blanching  macules  (typically  on  the  wrists,  ankles  and  forearms) that evolve maculopapules. Within 24 hours, it spreads centrally to involve the legs, buttocks, arms, axillae, trunk, neck and face. The entire body may be involved, including the mucous membranes of the palate and pharynx [1 1]. Characteristic of the rash are petechial lesions,  in  a  distribution  that  includes  the  palms  and  soles,  which occur in 36% to 82% of patients. In some severe cases, petechiae may coalesce to form large ecchymoses. No eschar at the inoculation site is visible. Severe manifestations may include pulmonary edema and hemorrhage, cerebral edema, myocarditis, renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and gangrene. Three factors are independent predictors of failure by the physician to initiate therapy the first time a patient is seen: absence of a rash, presentation between August 1 and April 30, and presentation within the first three days of illness. In untreated patients who survive their illness, the natural course of fever terminates after two to three weeks.\\n---\\n[CHIEF COMPLAINT]\\nDisease: Human Monkeypox\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was human monkeypox. This was a clinical diagnosis based on the patient's acute febrile illness, accompanied by a disseminated, uniform vesiculopustular skin rash involving the face, palms, soles, and oral mucosa, along with prominent generalized and cervical lymphadenopathy. This presentation is highly characteristic of monkeypox and distinguishes it from alternative diagnoses such as varicella, which typically presents with a heterogeneous rash and less prominent lymphadenopathy.\\nVitals: Temperature 38 °C (100.4 °F), pulse 110 beats per minute, blood pressure 105/82 mmHg.\\nContent: Acute febrile illness accompanied by malaise, headache, dry cough, neck swelling, and a disseminated skin rash, which appeared 2 days after initial symptoms.\\n---\\n[CHIEF COMPLAINT]\\nDisease: Severe Fever With Thrombocytopenia Syndrome\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (SFTS), caused by the SFTS virus. This diagnosis was definitively confirmed by a positive SFTS virus PCR in blood serum. Clinical presentation included acute fever, joint pain, headache, nausea, drowsiness, impaired consciousness, and respiratory distress, supported by laboratory findings of thrombocytopenia, elevated AST/ALT, LDH, and CK, alongside a negative CRP. The epidemiological context of living in southwestern Japan with potential wild animal and tick exposure further supported the diagnosis, while bacterial sepsis was ruled out after negative SFTS PCR results and no bacterial infection was identified.\\nVitals: On examination, his body temperature was 37 °C (98.6 °F), pulse rate 101 bpm, blood pressure 120/70 mmHg, SpO2 96% with 7l oxygen, and respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute.

Some people also experience confusion, changes in mental state, or a rash (though this is more common in children) as the illness progresses. Ehrlichiosis is caused by various species of Ehrlichia bacteria, which spread primarily through the bite of an infected Lone Star tick, commonly found in south-central, southeastern, and eastern coastal states. These symptoms can mimic the flu or other tick-borne diseases like anaplasmosis, so a medical evaluation is needed to confirm the diagnosis. If you have these symptoms after a tick bite or being in wooded areas, seeking prompt medical care is important because untreated cases can lead to serious complications like kidney or respiratory failure.'}]},\n",

In untreated patients who survive their illness, the natural course of fever terminates after two to three weeks.\\n---\\n[NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, PATHOLOGY, AND CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Pain and other symptoms may lessen with the rupture of the blister, but, at this time, pyogenic organisms invariably invade the superficial lesion and worm tract and aggravate the condition (Fig. 1 14.4). If the worm breaks during extraction and the remaining part retracts into the tissue, an intense inflammatory reaction occurs, with pain, swelling, and cellulitis along the worm tract, and usually the formation of an abscess. The reported period of incapacitation ranges from 2 to 16 weeks (average 8.5 weeks) [7-14] and more than half of a village's population may be affected at the same time. In addition to the blisters and skin lesions, the secondary bacterial infections usually exacerbate local inflammation and often lead to sepsis, abscesses, septic arthritis, contracture of muscles near joints, or even tetanus [15].\\nChronic manifestations are due to inflammation of the joints, with signs  and  symptoms  of  arthritis,  synovitis  [16],  and  muscle  and tendon contractures with resultant ankylosis of the limb [17]. Migration of the worms to the retroperitoneum and from the retroperitoneum  to  the  subcutaneous  tissue  in  the  leg  sometimes  results  in aberrant  (ectopic)  locations  such  as  the  pancreas,  lung,  periorbital tissues, testis, pericardium [18], and the spinal cord, producing compression [19] as well as focal abscess formation.\\n---\\n[VESICLES/BULLAE]\\nContent: Vesicles and  bullae  are fluid-filled  lesions. Herpetic involvement of the skin classically includes a vesicular phase, and is among the most common dermatoses encountered by the clinician. Herpetic vesicles lay on an erythematous base, and the lesions ulcerate and eventually heal  with  crusting.  Traditionally,  herpetic  ulcers  show  a  scalloped border with serosanguineous drainage, pain at the site, and, occasionally, ipsilateral lymphadenopathy. Chronic disease may lead to scarring. The patient experiences early dysesthesias at the site of a future eruption in recurrent disease. Most importantly, the diagnosis should be  suspected  in  those  with  chronic  ulcers,  particularly  if  they  are immunosuppressed.  Though  HSV-1  is  more  common  in  orofacial disease and HSV-2 in genital lesions, both strains can be seen in either location. Often a fixed location in the body is noted; however, primary disease can affect any area of the body.\\nZoster  infection  is  caused  by  reactivation  of  varicella  (chickenpox) virus  that  has  laid  dormant  in  basal  root  ganglia.  Zoster  usually presents with crop-like vesicles  along a dermatome. Zoster can disseminate, especially in immunocompromised patients. Greater than 20 lesions outside a dermatome should raise suspicion for dissemination. Ulcerations may be chronic, especially in immunocompromised patients. It is important to remember this diagnosis, particularly when steroid-responsive  diagnoses  such  as  pseudo-vesicular  Sweet's  syndrome (or idiopathic neutrophilic dermatosis) are considered, as oral steroid  use  in  patients  with  disseminated  zoster can be  lethal.  The occasionally  necrotic  center  of  evolving  lesions  may  easily  be  confused for a primary vasculitis. It is important to note, however, that vasculitis  seen in  the  setting  of  zoster  is  usually  reactive  and  not  a primary disease requiring steroids or cytotoxic medication, even when it is clearly present on skin biopsy.\\n---\\n[TRENCH FEVER]\\nContent: Trench  fever  is  an  acute  disease  characterized  by  sudden  onset  of high-grade fever, headaches, dizziness, and a characteristic pain in the shins.

I didn't think much of it, but now I have a red rash on that spot that is clearing up in the middle, looking almost like a target or a bull's-eye. I also feel awful—I have a fever, chills, a stiff neck, and my whole body aches like I have the flu. Is this just a reaction to the bite or an infection?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[ROCKY MOUNTAIN SPOTTED FEVER]\\nContent: Around one week after being bitten by an infected tick, the disease begins with fever, chills, myalgia and headache. During the next few days,  these  symptoms continue and may be  accompanied  by anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, photophobia and cough. The fever is typically high (39-41°C) and associated with a severe  frontal  headache.  Rash,  considered  the  hallmark  feature  of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, appears on day three of fever as small, pink,  blanching  macules  (typically  on  the  wrists,  ankles  and  forearms) that evolve maculopapules. Within 24 hours, it spreads centrally to involve the legs, buttocks, arms, axillae, trunk, neck and face. The entire body may be involved, including the mucous membranes of the palate and pharynx [1 1]. Characteristic of the rash are petechial lesions,  in  a  distribution  that  includes  the  palms  and  soles,  which occur in 36% to 82% of patients. In some severe cases, petechiae may coalesce to form large ecchymoses. No eschar at the inoculation site is visible. Severe manifestations may include pulmonary edema and hemorrhage, cerebral edema, myocarditis, renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and gangrene. Three factors are independent predictors of failure by the physician to initiate therapy the first time a patient is seen: absence of a rash, presentation between August 1 and April 30, and presentation within the first three days of illness. In untreated patients who survive their illness, the natural course of fever terminates after two to three weeks.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Human African Trypanosomiasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is first-stage East African Trypanosomiasis caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. This was definitively confirmed by the microscopic demonstration of 5 to 10 trypanosomes per high power field on a thick blood film. The diagnosis is supported by the epidemiological link to a national game park in Malawi with tsetse fly exposure, and the clinical signs of fever, rash, and a trypanosomal chancre. The normal CSF confirmed the disease was in the first stage, without neurological involvement.\\nVitals: On presentation, his vital signs were: temperature 38 °C, pulse rate 130 bpm, and systolic blood pressure 60 mmHg. He later developed a sustained fever of 38 to 39 °C during his hospital stay.\\nContent: Two days prior to admission, the patient sustained a possible tick bite on his ankle while walking in the countryside. Twenty-four hours later, he developed a painless, indurated lesion on his left ankle, accompanied by fever and arthralgia. A blood film for malaria was negative, and he was treated with paracetamol. On the day of admission, his condition worsened with the development of a widespread itchy rash, followed by progressive difficulty breathing and faintness, consistent with anaphylactic shock.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Bites,  for  example  by  the  large  aggressive  flies  variously  known  as horse flies, gadflies or cleggs (Tabanidae), may be immediately painful and traumatic but the commonest problem is delayed local swelling and itching from exposure to insects' salivary allergens incurred by previous bites. A small, intensely itchy, reddish lump with a central (hemorrhagic)  punctum  develops  immediately  or  after  a  delay  of 24-48 hours. A papule, urticarial weal, blister or bulla may develop (e.g.  after  'Blandford  fly' Simulium posticatum bites  in  Oxfordshire, UK), or bites may provoke a more generalized erythema multiforme or,  especially  in  children,  papular  urticaria,  and  sometimes  even systemic  anaphylaxis  may  be  provoked.  Triatomine  bug  bites  are usually multiple - often near the eye or angle of the mouth. They are painful, swollen, ooze blood and may be surrounded by black staining from the bug's feces (see Chapter 98, 'Chagas' Disease'). Scratching may lead to secondary infection, an inflamed, painful pustule or carbuncle, or a demarcated, hot, bright red, raised area of erysipelas or cellulitis. Causative bacteria include Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes . The risk of secondary infection seems to be higher under humid tropical conditions. It may be difficult to distinguish between  envenoming  or  allergy,  resulting  in  early  symptoms  after minutes or a few hours, and infection, resulting in late symptoms after many hours or even days.\\nFIGURE 136.2.1 Bug bite, São Paulo, Brazil (© David A. Warrell).\\n---\\n[SYMPTOMS OF ENVENOMING [6-9]]\\nContent: Envenoming by H. suspectum and H. horridum causes identical clinical syndromes. Pain may start immediately and is described as throbbing or burning. It may radiate up the bitten limb to the shoulder, chest and epigastrium, and is often excruciating in intensity, persisting for 24 hours or more. Swelling also develops rapidly, extending, in some cases, to involve the whole limb, but although it may be tense, compartment  syndrome  has  never  been  described.  The  bite  site  is  erythematous  or  cyanosed  with  traumatic  ecchymoses  and  persistent bleeding, but tissue necrosis does not develop. Red lymphangitic lines extend up the limb and regional lymph glands may become tender and enlarged. Local paresthesia, hyperesthesia and even paralysis have been  described.  The  earliest  systemic  symptoms  start  within  five minutes of the bite: dizziness, weakness, nausea, vomiting, profuse generalized sweating, breathlessness and weakness. Hypotension and tachycardia are commonly recorded. These symptoms may be transient or recurrent. Less commonly, there is angioedema (swelling of lips,  tongue,  throat  and  upper  airway)  [10],  increased  secretions, chills, fever and tinnitus.\\n---\\n[TRENCH FEVER]\\nContent: Trench  fever  is  an  acute  disease  characterized  by  sudden  onset  of high-grade fever, headaches, dizziness, and a characteristic pain in the shins. Dizziness and headaches are sometime so sudden that soldiers have been known to fall over in the trenches. Other symptoms include post-orbital  pain  (typically  exacerbated by movement), pain in  the lower limbs and back, constipation, a rash on the face, and a loss of appetite [12]. The first episode of fever may last 2-4 days and may be followed  by  relapses  every  4-6  days,  giving  rise  to  trench  fever's\\nFIGURE  67. 1 Body  louse,  a  vector  for B.  quintana ,  sucking  blood  on  a homeless patient.\\nFIGURE 67. 2 Pediculosis and super infection in a homeless man seeking care during a snapshot intervention in shelters.

I have constant diarrhea that is pale and smells terrible. I’ve also lost a lot of weight without trying, and I feel incredibly tired and weak all the time. My tongue also feels sore and burns. I thought it was just traveler’s diarrhea, but it's been weeks and isn't going away. What could be wrong?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[INTRODUCTION]\\nContent: Diarrheal disease is common among populations in tropical regions of the world and is a frequent illness in returned travelers. Acute and chronic  diarrhea  were  the  most  common  reasons  for  individuals seeking  post-travel  medical  care  in  the  GeoSentinel  surveillance network  of  17  tropical  and  travel  medicine  clinics  throughout  the world [1]. Presentation with acute diarrhea occurred at a rate of 222 visits  per  1000  travelers  seeking  medical  care,  and chronic  diarrhea occurred at a rate of 1 13 per 1000 visits, with the highest relative rates from  South  Asia  [1,  2].  At  the  Hospital  for  Tropical  Diseases  in London,  gastrointestinal  complaints  were  responsible  for  39%  of attendances at the walk-in clinic over the course of a year in which over 3000 patients used the service. Following an episode of diarrhea during travel, approximately 2% of individuals will go on to chronic illness [3].\\n---\\n[TRAVELER'S DIARRHEA]\\nContent: Campylobacter species  is  an  important  cause  of  traveler's  diarrhea. Most Campylobacter infections in travelers cause symptoms, although frank dysentery is rare. In a study of Spanish travelers with Campylobacter enteritis acquired in developing countries, only 4% had dysentery. Abdominal cramps were present in 83% of cases, fever in 46%, nausea and vomiting in 42%, and grossly bloody diarrhea in only 3% of cases [6, 7].\\n---\\n[EPIDEMIOLOGY]\\nContent: The  differential  diagnosis,  at  the  beginning  of  the  illness,  would include pathogenic enteric bacteria or viruses. However, as the illness progresses, the differential would include other intestinal protozoa, including Giardia lamblia .  A  rare  cause  of  illness  in  travelers, Cystoisospora  belli ,  can  produce  a  prolonged  diarrhea  after  travel,  and  is sensitive to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Fatigue and weight loss can be caused by Entamoeba histolytica , but anorexia is not as prominent. Dientamoeba fragilis can cause prolonged, low-grade intestinal symptoms, but without anorexia or weight loss. Fatigue and weight loss can be due to tropical sprue, which is a rare cause of prolonged diarrhea  in  travelers.  Celiac  sprue  occasionally  manifests  during foreign travel.\\n---\\n[ETIOLOGY]\\nContent: Etiologies of diarrhea in returned travelers can be divided into infectious, usually parasitic and  bacterial [4-6], post-infectious, for example lactose intolerance and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) [7], and non-infectious, such as inflammatory bowel disease (Table 1461). There is a wide range of microbial agents that cause diarrhea. Many episodes of  travelers' diarrhea  caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli will be self-limiting; however, invasive bacterial infections, such as Shigella spp., can produce more serious infections that will need antimicrobial  treatment.  For  diarrhea that lasts  more  than  14  days post-travel, protozoan parasites are more common: Giardia , the most\\n---\\n[DIARRHEA]\\nContent: Travelers' diarrhea has a reported incidence of at least 200 cases/1000 ill  returned travelers [3].  Fever is self-reported in one-third of these patients, making it an important underlying etiology in febrile travelers.  Specific  pathogens  vary  according  to  destination,  setting  and season; however, enteric bacteria including Escherichia coli , Campylobacter , Salmonella , and Shigella are the most common. In up to 50%, no  pathogen  is  identified.  The  combination  of  fever  and  bloody diarrhea is suggestive of bacterial or amebic dysentery, with the latter (uncommon in the returning traveler) often having a more indolent onset. In both cases, empiric  antibiotics should be considered (see below). It should be noted that any systemic febrile infection may have  diarrhea  at  presentation;  for  example,  severe  sepsis,  malaria, pneumococcal pneumonia.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

I thought it was just allergies or dry skin, but it's getting worse. What could this be?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Onchocerciasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is onchocerciasis (river blindness), caused by the filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus. The diagnosis was established based on the highly typical clinical triad of chronic pruritic dermatitis, subcutaneous nodules over bony prominences, and characteristic corneal opacities (sclerosing keratitis). This is strongly supported by the patient's lifelong residency in an endemic region of Togo near a fast-flowing river, the known breeding site for the Simulium blackfly vector.\\nContent: The patient has noticed changes in both eyes over the past 4 years, without current visual disturbances, but he is worried because adults in his village have gone blind after similar changes. For the past two decades, he has developed multiple painless bumps under his skin. He also suffers from intense itching of his skin that is severe enough to keep him awake at night.\\n---\\n[EDEMA]\\nContent: web spaces, genital involvement, and evidence of the causative mite on a mineral oil preparation can usually readily diagnose the latter condition. Of note, hyperpigmentation is not a distinguishing feature in differentiating among these diseases, as chronic infection in both may  lead to atopic dermatitis-like disease and patchy  hypo/ hyperpigmentation.  Plate-like  ichthyosis  over  leathery  skin  with hypo/hyperpigmentation,  commonly  referred  to  as  leopard  skin, would point to the diagnosis of chronic onchocerciasis. Loss of elasticity of skin can lead to 'hanging groin' .\\nTrichinosis can also be the cause of edema, though in this case, periorbital, nondependent edema is most commonly noted. Other dermatologic findings may include a hypersensitivity-like petechial rash, xerosis and subconjunctival hemorrhage.\\nAmerican trypanosomiasis can be difficult to diagnose acutely given its  nonspecific  systemic  and  dermatologic  manifestations.  Distinguishing features  of acute disease include the so-called 'chagoma', where the protozoal inoculum causes subcutaneous swelling, induration and erythema accompanied by local lymphadenopathy. When the eye is the portal of entry, Romañ a's sign may develop, comprised of  unilateral, painless, periorbital edema and conjunctival swelling. African trypanosomiasis also includes skin manifestations. A chancre can develop at the site of a bite from an infecting tsetse fly. The lesion can  rapidly  enlarge  and  ulcerate,  and  can  be  associated  with  local lymphadenopathy.  In  East  African  trypanosomiasis,  caused  by T. rhodesiense , high fever and toxemia are common, and patients often present  for  clinical  attention.  A  diffuse  macular  rash  may  also  be present.  In  West  African  trypanosomiasis,  caused  by T.  gambiense ,\\n---\\n[MEDICAL HISTORY AND EXAMINATION]\\nContent: Within  endemic  areas,  schistosomiasis  must  be  suspected  in  all patients presenting any symptom, however vague, that can be related to the infection. In travelers and migrants, a careful residence or travel history can help establish the diagnosis of schistosomiasis [31, 33]. In several sub-Saharan areas, both S. mansoni and S. haematobium, and even S. intercalatum, can be contracted. The patient who has lived in,\\n877\\nor  visited,  endemic  areas  must  be  asked  about  skin  contact  with freshwater of any kind, even if considered locally as safe or snail-free. Contacts of any type or duration can lead to infection. The patient may, or may not, report itching or rash shortly after the water contact. Visual  inspection  may help  diagnose  'swimmers'  itch'  after  recent exposure.\\nA medical history may reveal intermittent symptoms since the potential exposure, including flu-like syndromes in the weeks or months thereafter. Malaise, fatigue,  muscle pains, appetite loss, intermittent diarrhea, vague abdominal pain and red or dark urine are potential warning signs - partly depending on the suspected species. A neurologic history and examination is performed to exclude early cerebrospinal involvement. Abdominal palpation may reveal hepatomegaly or  splenomegaly  of  varying  degrees  and  abdominal  tenderness  or distention, but also may be entirely negative.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Bites,  for  example  by  the  large  aggressive  flies  variously  known  as horse flies, gadflies or cleggs (Tabanidae), may be immediately painful and traumatic but the commonest problem is delayed local swelling and itching from exposure to insects' salivary allergens incurred by previous bites. A small, intensely itchy, reddish lump with a central (hemorrhagic)  punctum  develops  immediately  or  after  a  delay  of 24-48 hours. A papule, urticarial weal, blister or bulla may develop (e.g.  after  'Blandford  fly' Simulium posticatum bites  in  Oxfordshire, UK), or bites may provoke a more generalized erythema multiforme or,  especially  in  children,  papular  urticaria,  and  sometimes  even systemic  anaphylaxis  may  be  provoked.

This was confirmed by serological testing showing a positive Mayaro IgM-IFA (1280 on 29 August, 40 on 12 September) and IgG-IFA (2560 on both dates) with a confirmatory plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) that rose from 40 to 160. The diagnosis aligns with the patient's travel history to the Amazon Basin, the preceding dengue-like febrile illness, and the characteristic prolonged symmetrical polyarthralgias primarily affecting small peripheral joints, while other common travel-related viral and bacterial causes were ruled out by serology.\\nVitals: No specific vital signs were reported other than the occurrence of an acute febrile illness with chills.\\nContent: During the second week of a 3.5-week trip to the Amazon Basin of northern Peru, the patient developed an acute febrile illness with chills, malaise, frontal headache, generalized myalgia, and a transient, non-pruritic maculopapular rash. The rash began on the forearms about 1 week after fever onset, spread to the trunk, neck, and face, and faded after 3 days. Slowly progressive, debilitating polyarthralgias affecting peripheral joints, with transient joint swelling, also developed. Painful cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy lasted for about 1 week. Fever and other acute symptoms subsided within 1 week, but polyarthralgias persisted, showing a symmetrical pattern mainly affecting the small joints of the hands and feet, wrists, ankles, and knees. Upon return to Switzerland a few weeks later, the patient reported stiffness of the affected joints, mainly in the morning and after immobility, and the joint pains did not improve for two more months.\\n---\\n[SOFT TISSUE INFECTIONS]\\nContent: Lacerations  and  penetrating  injuries  are  seen  in  manual  laborers, often with foreign bodies such as splinters, thorns, pieces of rock or metal, and shards of glass. They can lead to cellulitis, or superficial and deep abscesses. Some deep infections, such as hand flexor tendon\\nFIGURE 13.2 Osteomyelitis pathway.\\nsheaths, require early surgical debridement, or significant functional impairment can result.\\nOther soft tissue infections that can be seen in tropical environments are:  atypical  bacteria  (tularemia,  brucellosis),  fungi  (aspergillosis, cryptococcosis), and parasites (echinococosis, trichinosis).\\nTropical  pyomyositis  was  first  described  in  Uganda  in  1968  and presents with single to multiple suppurative lesions within skeletal muscle. It is more common in HIV-positive patients. Large muscles of the lower extremities and pelvic girdle are common sites of infection. Studies suggest up to 50% of patients report a previous injury. Examination usually reveals fever, diffuse fusiform swelling, and significant tenderness on palpation or passive stretching of the involved muscle, but usually no palpable fluid collection or fluctuation. The abscess is subfascial, within the muscle tissue itself, and poorly contained. S. aureus accounts for near 90% of cases. Multiple attempts at aspiration  with  a  large-bore  needle  are  often  necessary  to  retrieve purulent material,  and  should  be done  when  the  diagnosis  is  suspected. Orthopedic management is incision and drainage of abscesses or debridement of necrotic tissue if involvement is extensive. Antibiotics are necessary.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Cutaneous larva migrans\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is cutaneous larva migrans (CLM), caused by the accidental infestation of human skin by larvae of dog and cat hookworms.

This was confirmed by direct microscopic identification of Giardia trophozoites and cysts in stool samples. The clinical presentation of greasy, foul-smelling stools, bloating, and evidence of carbohydrate malabsorption (positive reducing substances in stool) is classic for this infection.\\nVitals: The patient has no fever; no other vital signs are reported.\\nContent: For the past two weeks, the patient has experienced four to five episodes of loose stools per day, accompanied by weight loss, anorexia, malaise, flatulence, and abdominal cramping during defecation. For the last three days, he has noted bloating and distension after consuming milk products. While he has mild nausea, he reports no fever. His stools were initially watery, but after a 5-day course of ciprofloxacin from a local pharmacy (which ended two days ago), they are now three to four per day and described as mushy, greasy, and foul-smelling.\\n---\\n[ABDOMINAL DISTENSION]\\nContent: Abdominal distension may be due to gas, either within or outside the  bowel  lumen.  Extraluminal  gas  is  seen  in  bowel  perforation, which is a surgical emergency. Gaseous distension of the bowel may be due to mechanical obstruction or motility disorder. Bloating is a common symptom in lactose malabsorption, which is commonplace among Africans and Asians after childhood, and in irritable bowel syndrome.\\n---\\n[SMALL BOWEL]\\nContent: A  wide  variety  of  disease  processes  give  rise  to  similar  histologic abnormalities in the mucosa of the small intestine, resulting in predictable  clinical  manifestations.  The  first  event  is  infiltration  of lymphocytes into the epithelium, resulting in an intraepithelial lymphocytosis. Next, there is increased crypt cell proliferation, resulting in  crypt  hyperplasia.  Then,  loss  of  villous  cells  leads  to  increasing degrees of villous atrophy, eventually leading to a flat mucosa. As a consequence of  mucosal malabsorption, patients present with diarrhea,  steatorrhea  and  weight  loss.  Laboratory  studies  may  be helpful in defining the extent of the malabsorption syndrome. Anemia may result from deficiencies of iron, folate and/or vitamin B12 - the latter implying that the mucosal damage extends to involve the terminal ileum. Prolongation of the prothrombin time may be due to a deficiency of vitamin K (one of the fat-soluble vitamins, along with A, D and E), which occurs in fat malabsorption. Hypophosphatemia, hypocalcemia  and  an  elevated  alkaline  phosphatase  are  seen  in vitamin D deficiency, which may cause osteomalacia or osteoporosis. Conditions that cause these histologic abnormalities and present with these  clinical  and  laboratory  features  include  parasitic  infections, celiac disease, tropical sprue, bacterial overgrowth and Crohn's disease (Box 3.4). Similar clinical manifestations may be seen in other disorders with specific pathologic findings, such as intestinal lymphoma and amyloidosis. The general principles of treating disorders of the small intestinal mucosa include treating the underlying disease and correcting any nutrient deficiencies that may be present. In addition, a lactose-free, low-fat diet may be beneficial.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Spinal cord schistosomiasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The patient was diagnosed with spinal cord schistosomiasis complicating an infection with Schistosoma haematobium. The diagnosis was established based on the clinical presentation of a conus syndrome, a clear exposure history of swimming in Lake Malawi, the prior identification of S. haematobium eggs in his urine, significant peripheral eosinophilia, and characteristic MRI findings of a lesion in the conus medullaris and bladder wall thickening. His complete recovery following treatment with praziquantel and corticosteroids further supports the diagnosis.\\nVitals: He has normal vital signs; specific values were not reported.\\nContent: For three weeks, the patient experienced progressive difficulty urinating, requiring increasing abdominal pressure and only being able to pass small amounts at a time, associated with lower abdominal discomfort, abnormal sensations in the groins and genitals, and some erectile dysfunction. He also reports that walking did not feel normal, though he could not specify the abnormality. He denies weakness, dysaesthesia, or loss of sensation in his legs, and has no backache. Over the past two months, he had an unintentional weight loss of 8kg and fatigue without fever or night sweats. One week prior to presentation, he noticed a single episode of reddish urine discoloration without painful micturition or fever, for which he was treated at a local clinic. There is no history of trauma.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Intestinal capillariasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is intestinal capillariasis caused by the nematode Capillaria philippinensis. The diagnosis was established based on the patient's clinical presentation of severe chronic diarrhoea, profound malabsorption with weight loss and oedema, and electrolyte abnormalities. Definitive confirmation was made by the identification of characteristic peanut-shaped ova on stool microscopy. The patient's residence in an endemic region and her positive clinical response to albendazole therapy further substantiated the diagnosis.\\nVitals: On presentation, the patient was afebrile, with a heart rate of 100 bpm and blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg.\\nContent: Symptoms began two months prior with stomach rumbles and colicky abdominal pain, which later progressed to anorexia and vomiting.

Some people also experience unintentional weight loss, muscle wasting, or signs of vitamin deficiencies such as anemia, dry skin, or bruising easily as the condition progresses. Malabsorption is caused by damage to the small intestine lining (from conditions like Celiac or Crohn's disease), enzyme deficiencies (like lactose intolerance), or issues with the pancreas, liver, or gallbladder that prevent the proper breakdown of food. These symptoms can arise from various underlying digestive disorders, so medical tests like stool analysis or hydrogen breath tests are needed to identify the specific cause.

It still doesn't really hurt, but it looks like raw meat and seems to be slowly spreading.

A small, intensely itchy, reddish lump with a central (hemorrhagic)  punctum  develops  immediately  or  after  a  delay  of 24-48 hours. A papule, urticarial weal, blister or bulla may develop (e.g.  after  'Blandford  fly' Simulium posticatum bites  in  Oxfordshire, UK), or bites may provoke a more generalized erythema multiforme or,  especially  in  children,  papular  urticaria,  and  sometimes  even systemic  anaphylaxis  may  be  provoked.  Triatomine  bug  bites  are usually multiple - often near the eye or angle of the mouth. They are painful, swollen, ooze blood and may be surrounded by black staining from the bug's feces (see Chapter 98, 'Chagas' Disease'). Scratching may lead to secondary infection, an inflamed, painful pustule or carbuncle, or a demarcated, hot, bright red, raised area of erysipelas or cellulitis. Causative bacteria include Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes . The risk of secondary infection seems to be higher under humid tropical conditions. It may be difficult to distinguish between  envenoming  or  allergy,  resulting  in  early  symptoms  after minutes or a few hours, and infection, resulting in late symptoms after many hours or even days.\\nFIGURE 136.2.1 Bug bite, São Paulo, Brazil (© David A.

The envenomation was most likely caused by an African puff-adder (*Bitis arietans*), based on the snake's distinct physical description, its behavior, the geographic location in Malawi, and the clinical presentation of severe local cytotoxic effects (haemorrhagic bullae, massive swelling, extensive necrosis) and initial systemic haematotoxicity (bleeding gums). The patient's septic shock on arrival was a late complication of the untreated necrotic wound.\\nVitals: On admission, the patient appeared weak and was in respiratory distress. His temperature was 39.4 °C, pulse 126 bpm, blood pressure 85/60 mmHg, and respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute.\\nContent: Three weeks prior to presentation, the patient was bitten by a snake while playing in rocky grassland. The snake was described as brown with V-shaped black bands and approximately one metre long. Shortly after the bite, he developed haemorrhagic bullae on his right leg, bleeding gums, and extensive vomiting. He was initially taken to a traditional healer, after which the bleeding and vomiting resolved. However, he subsequently developed intense pain and swelling at the bite site, which progressed to the current necrotic wound.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Snakebite envenomation\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is a severe cytotoxic and haemotoxic snakebite envenomation, complicated by secondary bacterial infection and sepsis. The causative agent was identified as most probably the African puff-adder (Bitis arietans), based on the snake's description, the endemic location, and the clinical manifestations of massive local tissue necrosis and initial systemic haemorrhage. The diagnosis was supported by laboratory findings of leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia, and the patient's septic clinical state upon late presentation.\\nVitals: The patient appears weak and is in respiratory distress.

He was taken to a traditional healer, and while the bleeding and vomiting resolved, he developed intense pain and swelling at the bite site, which progressed to a necrotic wound.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Cutaneous myiasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The diagnosis is cutaneous furuncular myiasis caused by the larva of the Tumbu fly, *Cordylobia anthropophaga*.

The lesion was described as itchy but not painful. There was no history of fever or other systemic symptoms, and the patient was otherwise feeling fine. She did not recall any specific arthropod bites.\\n---\\n[THE TRYPANOSOMAL CHANCRE]\\nContent: Tsetse bites can be quite painful. In the case of an infection, a local reaction called trypanosomal chancre (Fig. 97.4) can develop at the site where the fly has injected parasites with its saliva. A small raised papule develops after about 5 days. It increases rapidly in size, surrounded by an intense erythematous tissue reaction with local edema and regional lymphadenopathy. Although some chancres have a very angry appearance, they are usually not very painful unless they become ulcerated and superinfected. They heal without treatment after several weeks,  leaving  a  permanent,  hyperpigmented  spot.  Trypanosomal chancres occur in more than half the cases of T. b. rhodesiense . In T. b. gambiense ,  they are much less common and often go undetected in endemic  populations.  Inexperienced  clinicians  might  misdiagnose chancres  as  cutaneous  manifestations  of  bacterial  diseases,  such  as superinfected insect bites, eschar or cutaneous anthrax.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

I tried picking at it, but it hurts too much. What is this?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Tungiasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is tungiasis, an infestation caused by the burrowing female sand flea, Tunga penetrans. The diagnosis was made clinically based on the pathognomonic appearance of a dark nodule on the toe with a central ulceration, the history of white oval granules (eggs) emerging with pressure, and strong epidemiological links, including living on a farm in an endemic region of Bolivia with a similarly affected family member.\\nContent: The patient presented with a slowly growing nodule on the fifth toe of her right foot over several days, causing moderate pain when wearing shoes. Her parents reported that when they tried to squeeze the lesion, they observed white oval granules emerging from the nodule.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Burrows most commonly occur in the interdigital clefts between the fingers  and  on  the  wrists,  but  may  be  widespread  (Fig.  136.4.1). Tracks  are  serpiginous,  extending  for  a  few  millimeters  up  to  one centimeter,  creating  linear  papulovescular  lesions  with  excoriation, secondary  infection,  eczematization,  lichenification  and  erythematous papules. Lesions are intensely itchy, especially at night and after a  hot  bath  or  shower, provoking scratching -  excoriation that promotes secondary infection. In about 7% of cases, very itchy reddish brown  nodules  occur  on  the  genitalia,  groin,  buttocks  and  axillae (nodular scabies). In infants, vesicular, pustular and nodular lesions are found on the axillae, head, face, diaper region, palms and soles. An exuberantly crusting form, Norwegian scabies, occurs in patients immunosuppressed by HIV, human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-1 or by drugs employed in organ transplantation, and in people with trisomy-21. Demarcated, hyperkeratotic, scaly plaques involve, in particular,  the  extremities,  scalp,  face,  neck  and  buttocks.  The  scales contain thousands of mites and the load per patient may exceed 1 million mites. This type of scabies is very infectious and a single case can give rise to nosocomial outbreaks.\\n---\\n[FOOT INFECTIONS]\\nContent: Athlete's  foot or  tinea  pedis  is  a  term  used  to  describe  scaling  and maceration accompanied by itching between the toes, particularly the fourth  interdigital  space.  It  is  a  syndrome  that  may  be  caused  by Candida species, erythrasma or Gram-negative bacteria, as well as by dermatophytes. In dermatophyte infections, the area between the toes may be wet or dry and, in some infections, particularly those caused by Trichophyton interdigitale , vesicular. Involvement of the dorsum of the foot or the sole may occur. The commonest cause is T. rubrum .\\nSymptoms may be minimal. It is more common in people who wear shoes and socks and is therefore associated with urban areas in the tropics.\\nTinea pedis in tropical areas must be distinguished from eczema and, less commonly, plantar psoriasis [4]. The interplay between bacteria and fungi is poorly understood but, in the tropics, secondary Gramnegative bacterial infection on top of interdigital dermatophytosis can occur.\\n---\\n[ONYCHOMYCOSIS]\\nContent: Dermatophyte invasion of the nails is uncommon in the tropics. The nail  plate  is  invaded  from  the  distal  border  and  lateral  surfaces, usually from the underside. The affected nail becomes thickened and opaque  with  a  varying  degree  of  onycholysis.  Patients  often  have infection of other sites, such as the soles or toe webs. In addition to psoriasis, other fungal infections, for example candida or Scytalidium , must be differentiated from onychomycosis caused by dermatophytes [7].\\n---\\n[FINAL DIAGNOSIS]\\nDisease: Tungiasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is tungiasis, an infestation caused by the burrowing female sand flea, Tunga penetrans.

Is this something I need to worry about, or will it go away on its own?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Human African Trypanosomiasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is first-stage East African Trypanosomiasis caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. This was definitively confirmed by the microscopic demonstration of 5 to 10 trypanosomes per high power field on a thick blood film. The diagnosis is supported by the epidemiological link to a national game park in Malawi with tsetse fly exposure, and the clinical signs of fever, rash, and a trypanosomal chancre. The normal CSF confirmed the disease was in the first stage, without neurological involvement.\\nVitals: On presentation, his vital signs were: temperature 38 °C, pulse rate 130 bpm, and systolic blood pressure 60 mmHg. He later developed a sustained fever of 38 to 39 °C during his hospital stay.\\nContent: Two days prior to admission, the patient sustained a possible tick bite on his ankle while walking in the countryside. Twenty-four hours later, he developed a painless, indurated lesion on his left ankle, accompanied by fever and arthralgia. A blood film for malaria was negative, and he was treated with paracetamol. On the day of admission, his condition worsened with the development of a widespread itchy rash, followed by progressive difficulty breathing and faintness, consistent with anaphylactic shock.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Bites,  for  example  by  the  large  aggressive  flies  variously  known  as horse flies, gadflies or cleggs (Tabanidae), may be immediately painful and traumatic but the commonest problem is delayed local swelling and itching from exposure to insects' salivary allergens incurred by previous bites. A small, intensely itchy, reddish lump with a central (hemorrhagic)  punctum  develops  immediately  or  after  a  delay  of 24-48 hours. A papule, urticarial weal, blister or bulla may develop (e.g.  after  'Blandford  fly' Simulium posticatum bites  in  Oxfordshire, UK), or bites may provoke a more generalized erythema multiforme or,  especially  in  children,  papular  urticaria,  and  sometimes  even systemic  anaphylaxis  may  be  provoked.  Triatomine  bug  bites  are usually multiple - often near the eye or angle of the mouth. They are painful, swollen, ooze blood and may be surrounded by black staining from the bug's feces (see Chapter 98, 'Chagas' Disease'). Scratching may lead to secondary infection, an inflamed, painful pustule or carbuncle, or a demarcated, hot, bright red, raised area of erysipelas or cellulitis. Causative bacteria include Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes . The risk of secondary infection seems to be higher under humid tropical conditions. It may be difficult to distinguish between  envenoming  or  allergy,  resulting  in  early  symptoms  after minutes or a few hours, and infection, resulting in late symptoms after many hours or even days.\\nFIGURE 136.2.1 Bug bite, São Paulo, Brazil (© David A. Warrell).\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Cutaneous myiasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The diagnosis is cutaneous furuncular myiasis caused by the larva of the Tumbu fly, *Cordylobia anthropophaga*. This was confirmed by the characteristic clinical presentation of a slowly evolving, itchy boil in a traveler returning from Ghana, and the successful extraction of the maggot after occlusive therapy. The pulsating appearance of the larva's respiratory spiracles upon close inspection was a key diagnostic feature, effectively ruling out a bacterial abscess or other causes of eschar.\\nVitals: The patient was afebrile. No other vital signs were reported.\\nContent: The patient presented with a localized swelling on her left leg which had developed slowly over the preceding 3 weeks following a trip abroad. The lesion was described as itchy but not painful. There was no history of fever or other systemic symptoms, and the patient was otherwise feeling fine. She did not recall any specific arthropod bites.\\n---\\n[ACUTE SCHISTOSOMIASIS (KATAYAMA FEVER)]\\nContent: This should be considered in febrile travelers returning from Africa. Travelers give a history of freshwater exposure 4-6 (up to 9) weeks prior  to  symptom  onset.  Some  describe  a  self-resolving  itchy  rash immediately  following  exposure  (swimmer's  itch).  Symptoms  and signs include fever, lethargy, myalgia, arthralgia, cough, wheeze, headache,  urticarial  rash,  diarrhea  and  hepatosplenomegaly  [19].  The\\nFIGURE 143.4 Patient returned 1 month previously from a 2-week holiday in Thailand. Two days ago, he developed fever, headache and rash.

He describes developing 'sunstroke' on the last day of his holiday (sunburn,  headache,  feverish).  Symptoms  have  not  settled.  Diagnosis: dengue.\\neosinophil count is usually elevated at presentation of acute schistosomiasis and provides supportive evidence for the diagnosis, but it may only appear a few days after symptom onset. Acute symptoms are self-limiting in most cases.\\n---\\n[PREVENTION]\\nContent: Be  prepared  for  insect  bites,  not  only  in  tropical  rain  forests  and beaches, but also in the arctic and in cool mountainous terrain such as  the  Californian  Sierra  Nevada,  Italian  Dolomites  and  Scottish Highlands. The risk of getting bitten varies geographically, seasonally and diurnally. Seek specific advice.\\n- Sensible clothing should be as ample and protective as comfort (but not vanity) demands. Long sleeves and long trousers should be worn after dusk. Light colors are less attractive to mosquitoes than dark ones. Blue color attracts African tsetse flies (see Chapter 97, 'Sleeping Sickness'). Hats and face veils may be necessary to protect against mass attacks on face and scalp by swarms of Scottish midges (Culicoides), or tropical blackflies (Simulium). This protection is recommended in places where there is a high risk of acquiring muco-cutaneous leishmaniasis by bites of tiny sandflies (Phlebotomus,  Lutzomyia),  for  example  Manu  National  Park in Peru.\\n- Effective repellents include diethyl-toluamide (DEET) and p-methane-diol. These can be applied to exposed skin or impregnated into cotton clothing and socks, and ankle, wrist and head bands.\\n- Clothes can be impregnated with pyrethroid insecticides but this may impair waterproofing.\\n- Protect sleeping quarters. Night bites by mosquitoes that transmit malaria,  cone-nosed  (triatomine)  'kissing'  bugs  (Central  and South America) that transmit Chagas' disease, bed bugs, soft ticks that  transmit  tick-borne  encephalitis  and  tick-borne  relapsing fever, and even vampire bats that transmit rabies (see Chapters 34.1 and 134.6), can be prevented by sleeping under a a well tucked-in pyrethroid-impregnated  mosquito  net.  Mosquito  proofing  of sleeping quarters and insecticide spraying at dusk reduces the risk. Pyrethroid-releasing mosquito coils can be burned or, if there is electricity,  plug-in  insecticide  vaporizers  can be used. Fans  may deter mosquitoes from biting.\\nAlthough  not  related  to  insect  bites,  beware  of  Chagas'  disease acquired through drinking raw jungle fruit and sugar cane juices (e.g. in Brazil and Venezuela) contaminated with infected triatomine bugs (see 'American trypanosomiasis').\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

Since I got home, I've developed a fever, a bad cough with some chest pain, and a headache that won't go away. I also noticed a painful sore on my leg that looks like an abscess and isn't healing. I have diabetes, so I'm worried about infection. Could this be related to my trip?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[INTRODUCTION]\\nContent: Up to 70% of travelers to developing countries report health problems,  the  majority  of  which  are  self-limiting;  however  8-15%  of travelers are ill enough to seek medical attention while abroad or on return home, with fever as a common presenting complaint [1-4]. While  for  many  the  underlying  cause  is  a  self-limiting  globally endemic infection, such as gastroenteritis, physicians are increasingly encountering conditions not normally seen in the patient's country of origin. In some cases these are potentially life-threatening, such as malaria, and others have potential public health consequences, such as enteric fever.\\nTo evaluate returned travelers presenting with fever, an understanding of the geographic distribution of infections, risk factors for acquisition, incubation periods and clinical presentations is required. With this understanding, a risk assessment can be undertaken, initial investigations  instigated,  and,  when  appropriate,  presumptive  therapy started.\\n---\\n[PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS [5]]\\nContent: The evaluation of fever in returned travelers requires an understanding of the epidemiologic factors which influence exposure to specific pathogens. These factors are reflected in the travel history and include geographic  destinations  visited,  dates  of  particular  risk  exposures, time  of  onset  and  duration  of  symptoms.  The  first  two  determine which infections the traveler may have been exposed to and the last two  allow  for  an  estimation  of  the  incubation  period  (see  Tables 143.1 & 143.2).\\nAs can be seen from Figure 143.1, the travel history is vital for determining the likely diagnosis, as many infections can have similar clinical presentations. Certain symptoms and signs may give further clues; relevant examination findings include rash, eschar, hepatosplenomegaly and jaundice (see Tables 143-3, 143-4 & 143-5). Table 143-6 lists  the  differential  diagnosis  in  patients  with  chronic  fever  ( > 2 weeks), and is a reminder that noninfectious causes of fever are seen in this group.\\nTravelers presenting with undifferentiated fever should have a number of initial recommended investigations performed (see Table 143-7). Following this, specific investigations may be appropriate, depending on the differential diagnosis (see Table 143-8). Where tuberculosis is considered, it is essential that adequate samples of sputum or tissue for  mycobacteria  culture  are  obtained.  Tuberculin  skin  tests  and interferon-gamma release assays have a limited role in evaluation of patients with chronic fever.\\nRarely, fever in the returned traveler may be due to a viral hemorrhagic fever such as Lassa, Ebola, Marburg or Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever.  The  diagnosis  should  be  considered  in  travelers  who  have visited endemic regions within 21 days of symptom onset [29,30], in particular, travel to rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa (particularly West Africa); contact with suspected cases, healthcare facilities, rats or wild animals  raises  the  index  of  suspicion.  Symptoms  and  signs  vary according to pathogen, with bleeding in  advanced  cases.  Although rare, these infections can be severe and have implications for nosocomial transmission. Malaria must be excluded; however, PCR of blood may be required, before further investigations (which might result in exposure of healthcare staff) are performed. A high index of suspicion and  close  liaison  with  specialists  are  necessary  to  manage  such patients appropriately.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Cutaneous myiasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The diagnosis is cutaneous furuncular myiasis caused by the larva of the Tumbu fly, *Cordylobia anthropophaga*. This was confirmed by the characteristic clinical presentation of a slowly evolving, itchy boil in a traveler returning from Ghana, and the successful extraction of the maggot after occlusive therapy.

The lesion was described as itchy but not painful. There was no history of fever or other systemic symptoms, and the patient was otherwise feeling fine. She did not recall any specific arthropod bites.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Mayaro fever\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was Mayaro fever, caused by Mayaro virus (MAYV). This was confirmed by serological testing showing a positive Mayaro IgM-IFA (1280 on 29 August, 40 on 12 September) and IgG-IFA (2560 on both dates) with a confirmatory plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) that rose from 40 to 160. The diagnosis aligns with the patient's travel history to the Amazon Basin, the preceding dengue-like febrile illness, and the characteristic prolonged symmetrical polyarthralgias primarily affecting small peripheral joints, while other common travel-related viral and bacterial causes were ruled out by serology.\\nVitals: No specific vital signs were reported other than the occurrence of an acute febrile illness with chills.\\nContent: During the second week of a 3.5-week trip to the Amazon Basin of northern Peru, the patient developed an acute febrile illness with chills, malaise, frontal headache, generalized myalgia, and a transient, non-pruritic maculopapular rash. The rash began on the forearms about 1 week after fever onset, spread to the trunk, neck, and face, and faded after 3 days. Slowly progressive, debilitating polyarthralgias affecting peripheral joints, with transient joint swelling, also developed. Painful cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy lasted for about 1 week. Fever and other acute symptoms subsided within 1 week, but polyarthralgias persisted, showing a symmetrical pattern mainly affecting the small joints of the hands and feet, wrists, ankles, and knees. Upon return to Switzerland a few weeks later, the patient reported stiffness of the affected joints, mainly in the morning and after immobility, and the joint pains did not improve for two more months.\\n---\\n[MALARIA]\\nContent: Malaria may become symptomatic after the initial post-travel period, and so all returned travelers from malaria-endemic areas should be educated  about  nonspecific  symptoms  and  signs,  especially  fever, during the first few months after return. They should be advised to seek  an  early  medical  opinion  and  inform  health  professionals  of their travel history, should these symptoms occur.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

Could this still be a parasite?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS]\\nContent: The onset of symptoms can vary from a few hours after ingesting food containing preformed toxins, to several days after ingesting bacterial pathogens, to two or more weeks in parasitic infections. Acute infectious  diarrhea  can  be  classified  into  watery  diarrhea  and  bloody diarrhea (dysentery) (Box 3.1). Noninfectious causes of acute diarrhea are less significant in the tropics, but causes that should be considered include toxin-induced (e.g. organophosphate poisoning), medicationrelated and ischemic colitis. The most important physical signs to be\\n---\\n[UNCOMPLICATED MALARIA]\\nContent: Uncomplicated malaria illness  is  by  far the  most  common  clinical manifestation of a malaria infection and fever, or history of fever, is the most common symptom. There are no pathognomonic signs by which 'uncomplicated malaria' can be distinguished from common viral causes  of  fever  (Box  96.2).  The  presence  of  malaria  parasitemia increases the odds of a causal connection, especially in non-immune individuals, where peripheral parasitemia is nearly always associated with symptoms. Many semi-immune individuals (generally long-term residents  of  malaria-endemic  areas)  can  harbor  parasites  without becoming symptomatic and, in these individuals, peripheral blood parasitemia may well be 'incidental' to the symptoms [12]. In practical terms, symptomatic, parasitemic individuals who are alert enough to take oral medications are considered to have 'uncomplicated malaria' .\\nImportant  aspects  of  the  clinical  history  include  travel  itinerary, malaria precautions (chemoprophylaxis, use of bed nets and repellents) and recent prior treatment with anti-malarial drugs. The physical exam is useful for identifying other potential etiologies. In endemic areas,  the  presence  of  hepato-  or  splenomegaly  tilt  the  differential diagnosis  toward  malaria,  as  does  thrombocytopenia.  For  nonimmune travelers, the presence of fever, splenomegaly, hyperbilirubinemia and thrombocytopenia make malaria more likely [13].\\nCommon presenting signs are generalized constitutional symptoms including  fever,  chills,  dizziness,  backache,  myalgia,  malaise  and fatigue (frequently summarized as 'total body pain' by endemic-area adults). Gastrointestinal symptoms (i.e. anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea) can be prominent, causing confusion with  gastroenteritis.  Patients  may  have  nonproductive  cough  and dyspnea, consistent with acute respiratory infections. Young children and semi-immune adults may present with only fever and headache.\\n---\\n[INTESTINAL OR ENTERAL PHASE]\\nContent: The initial consequences of infection occur within the first week after ingestion of larval worms in inadequately cooked meat (Table 1 15-2). The symptoms, reflecting mucosal irritation as adult worms develop in  the  small  intestine,  include  nausea,  abdominal  cramps,  loss  of appetite, vomiting, low-grade fever, and either mild diarrhea or constipation. Frontal headaches, dizziness, and weakness can also occur, especially in light to moderate infections. Severe diarrhea, persisting for weeks, can be seen in heavy infections. Infected Inuit Indians in North America experience an unusually high frequency of diarrhea and a low frequency of myalgia. This may reflect chronic exposure and the development of intestinal immunity [4].\\n---\\n[STEPHEN G WRIGHT]\\nContent: frequently identified agent and travel to South Asia, the highest risk [6]. Although parasites are considered more common with chronic disease, bacterial diarrhea can also persist beyond a week [8].\\nWhile Giardia is the commonest parasitic cause of persisting diarrhea, Cryptosporidium spp. and, less  commonly, Cyclospora cayetanensis are also  recognized.  Amebiasis  is  uncommon  in  short-term  travelers, being  typically  seen  in  long-term  travelers  or  expatriates.

H. pylori infection may be asymptomatic, but a wide range of symptoms, including abdominal pain,  weight  loss,  nausea,  dyspepsia,  vomiting,  and  bloating,  have been attributed to this infection. H. pylori does cause chronic gastritis and increases the risk of duodenal and gastric ulcers, and persistent infection  increases  the  risk  of  gastric  cancer.  Treatment  is  recommended for those with gastric ulcer disease or malignancy; treatment for  other  clinical  manifestations  associated  with H.  pylori infection remains controversial [1 1].\\nInfection with intestinal nematodes is common among immigrants from developing countries and may cause abdominal pain, though often  is  asymptomatic.  The  hookworms Ancylostoma  duodenale and Necator americanus may be associated with anemia and protein deficiency due to blood loss. Ascaris lumbricoides can cause an impaired nutritional status, especially in children. Trichuris trichiura can cause pus-filled, bloody stools and rectal prolapse.\\nDiarrhea in immigrants may be the result of bacterial, viral, or parasitic infection. Time since arrival, recent exposures, and specific clinical symptoms help focus the evaluation appropriately. Giardia lamblia , a common cause of diarrhea in children, is more often asymptomatic in  immigrants.  Chronic  diarrhea  or  epigastric  pain,  particularly  in the immunosuppressed, can suggest a diagnosis of Strongyloides stercoralis [12].\\nEntamoeba histolytica may be asymptomatic, but has the potential to cause invasive disease if not diagnosed and treated. This parasite is associated with a dysentery-like illness, with blood or pus in the stool along with abdominal pain and fever. Liver abscess can present with fever, right upper quadrant pain, weight loss, hepatomegaly, and jaundice.  It  usually  presents  within  several  months  of  departure  from endemic areas and occurs frequently in  young men. Most cases  of amebic dysentery or liver abscess in the US originate from Mexico, but other Latin American countries, South Africa, India, and Southeast Asia also have high rates of amebic disease.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

This was diagnosed clinically based on the pathognomonic finding of pruritic, serpiginous tracks on the skin, supported by a clear exposure history of skin contact with sand in an endemic area (Thailand/Australia). The diagnosis was confirmed by the rapid and complete resolution of symptoms after a single dose of ivermectin.\\nContent: The patient developed three intensely itchy skin eruptions on both upper thighs just after arriving in Australia, one week prior to presentation. The itch was so severe that it kept him awake at night. He reported no fever, cough, or wheeze and was otherwise completely well.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Stevens-Johnson syndrome\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), a severe drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction. This clinical diagnosis is based on the patient's generalized maculopapular rash with extensive mucous membrane involvement (oral, conjunctival, genital), which appeared approximately four weeks after starting nevirapine and co-trimoxazole, both of which are highly implicated drugs. The diagnosis is further supported by the much higher incidence of SJS in HIV-positive individuals. Infectious causes like malaria were ruled out with negative testing.\\nVitals: Temperature is 37.7°C (99.9°F), blood pressure is 120/68 mmHg, pulse is 90 bpm, and respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute.\\nContent: The patient developed a productive cough with whitish sputum, followed one day later by a generalized skin rash that started on her trunk and spread to the extremities and mucosal membranes. Over the past two days, she also developed a sore throat and dysuria. The rash involves her lips, oral mucosa, conjunctivae, and genital mucosa, and has made talking and eating difficult and painful.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Spinal tuberculosis (Pott's disease)\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is presumed spinal tuberculosis (Pott's disease). This is based on the chronic, progressive spastic paraparesis with a thoracic sensory level in a patient from a TB-endemic region who is also HIV-positive. The diagnosis is strongly supported by the spinal radiograph showing collapse of the T11 vertebral body and a paravertebral soft tissue mass, which are characteristic findings. Schistosomiasis was ruled out with negative stool and urine tests, and the insidious onset made acute transverse myelitis less likely.\\nVitals: On a visit three months after symptom onset, his temperature was slightly elevated at 37.5 °C (99.5 °F). Upon admission to the tertiary hospital, he was afebrile with normal vital signs.\\nContent: The illness began one year prior with back pain. Over the following weeks, he developed difficulty walking and a 'pins and needles' sensation in his legs. Three months after onset, he presented to a health centre with a temperature of 37.5 °C and was given antimalarials and praziquantel. He also consulted a traditional healer. His condition progressively deteriorated over the next six months, eventually leaving him bedridden. The patient denies constitutional symptoms such as fever, night sweats, weight loss, or chronic cough. He has no haematuria or diarrhoea and is continent for stool and urine.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Visceral leishmaniasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar), caused by a Leishmania protozoan. This diagnosis is supported by the patient's presentation with chronic undulating fever, severe malnutrition, splenomegaly, generalized lymphadenopathy, and pancytopenia. Epidemiological risk was high, as she was from a known endemic area with a family history of the disease. Although an initial rK39 RDT was negative, the diagnosis was confirmed by a positive Direct Agglutination Test (DAT) with a high titre of 1:6400 and a definitive clinical response to treatment with liposomal amphotericin B.\\nVitals: On presentation, her vital signs were: temperature 39.6°C (103.3°F), pulse 96 bpm, and blood pressure 100/60 mmHg.\\nContent: For the past four weeks, the patient has experienced an undulating fever, occurring mainly in the afternoon, accompanied by chills and occasional convulsions. Initially, she was well between febrile episodes and played normally. However, over time she has developed progressive anorexia, a dry cough, chest pain, and joint and back pain.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Amoebic liver abscess\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is an amoebic liver abscess, caused by Entamoeba histolytica. This is supported by the clinical triad of fever and tender hepatomegaly with right intercostal tenderness, imaging findings of a large solitary liver lesion with an elevated hemidiaphragm, and the aspiration of characteristic 'brownish pus'. The diagnosis was further confirmed by the patient's rapid clinical response to metronidazole therapy and the relevant epidemiological risk factor of consuming locally brewed alcohol known to be associated with amoebiasis.\\nVitals: On examination, the patient's temperature was 38.3 °C (100.8 °F), blood pressure was 100/80 mmHg, pulse was 102 bpm, and respiratory rate was 24 breath cycles per minute.\\nContent: For the past week, the patient experienced fever, chills, headache, and body aches, along with severe right-hypochondrial pain.

It  is  a  syndrome  that  may  be  caused  by Candida species, erythrasma or Gram-negative bacteria, as well as by dermatophytes. In dermatophyte infections, the area between the toes may be wet or dry and, in some infections, particularly those caused by Trichophyton interdigitale , vesicular. Involvement of the dorsum of the foot or the sole may occur. The commonest cause is T. rubrum .\\nSymptoms may be minimal. It is more common in people who wear shoes and socks and is therefore associated with urban areas in the tropics.\\nTinea pedis in tropical areas must be distinguished from eczema and, less commonly, plantar psoriasis [4]. The interplay between bacteria and fungi is poorly understood but, in the tropics, secondary Gramnegative bacterial infection on top of interdigital dermatophytosis can occur.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Tungiasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is tungiasis, an infestation caused by the burrowing female sand flea, Tunga penetrans. The diagnosis was made clinically based on the pathognomonic appearance of a dark nodule on the toe with a central ulceration, the history of white oval granules (eggs) emerging with pressure, and strong epidemiological links, including living on a farm in an endemic region of Bolivia with a similarly affected family member.\\nContent: The patient presented with a slowly growing nodule on the fifth toe of her right foot over several days, causing moderate pain when wearing shoes. Her parents reported that when they tried to squeeze the lesion, they observed white oval granules emerging from the nodule.\\n---\\n[CHIEF COMPLAINT]\\nDisease: Human African Trypanosomiasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is first-stage East African Trypanosomiasis caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense.

The envenomation was most likely caused by an African puff-adder (*Bitis arietans*), based on the snake's distinct physical description, its behavior, the geographic location in Malawi, and the clinical presentation of severe local cytotoxic effects (haemorrhagic bullae, massive swelling, extensive necrosis) and initial systemic haematotoxicity (bleeding gums). The patient's septic shock on arrival was a late complication of the untreated necrotic wound.\\nVitals: On admission, the patient appeared weak and was in respiratory distress. His temperature was 39.4 °C, pulse 126 bpm, blood pressure 85/60 mmHg, and respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute.\\nContent: There was an extensive, foul-smelling necrosis affecting his right foot and ankle, with exposed tendons. The right lower leg was swollen, and he was unable to bend his right ankle. Inguinal lymph nodes on the right side were enlarged.

Although most cases are caused by HTLV-I, a small number of patients infected with HTLV-II have also developed HAM/ TSP.

For unknown reasons,  women  progress  faster  than  men,  especially  those  who develop disease prior to menopause. Other risk factors for more rapid progression include older age at disease onset and increased HTLV-1 proviral  loads  [6,  9,  10].  HTLV-II-associated  disease  appears  to  be milder and have a more slowly progressive course.\\nThe association of HTLV-1 and HAM/TSP was first noted in tropical regions  of  the  Caribbean  and  South  America  (hence  the  original name:  tropical  spastic  paraparesis).  While  HAM/TSP  is  most  commonly seen in the Caribbean, South America, and southern Japan, the relative risk of developing HAM/TSP seems to be higher in Latin America than in Japan [3, 1 1].\\n---\\n[KEY SYNDROMES AND CLINICAL APPROACH]\\nContent: Peripheral nerve syndromes are the most frequent of the neuromuscular disorders encountered. The most common causes are diabetes, HIV, leprosy, drugs, toxins and nutritional deficiencies [although the complete list is much longer (Box 10.12)]. Identifying drug, toxin and nutritional causes rapidly is important as it will obviate the need for extensive investigations, and removal of the offending drug or toxin will stop progression and result in recovery if identified early enough. Similarly, treatment with the appropriate vitamins and nutrients will stop progression and help with recovery, although this may not be complete. Nowadays, and especially in the tropics, HIV, which can affect all areas of the neuro-axis, including nerve and muscle, features high on every list of differential diagnosis. Furthermore, as much of the  developing  world  has  a  growing  middle  class  who  are  rapidly adopting Western lifestyles and diets with fast foods and less exercise, diabetes and obesity are an increasing problem with the well-known consequences.\\nThe prevalence of relatively common neuromuscular conditions such as Guillain-Barré  syndrome (GBS), chronic inflammatory demyelinating  polyneuropathy  (CIDP),  polymyositis  and  myasthenia  gravis (MG) is  unknown  in  the  'tropics' .  For  the  most  part,  there  is  no reason why they should be more or less prevalent; however, the acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) form of GBS, which is often associated with Campylobacter jejuni infection, was, at one time, especially common in China, probably because of the way domestic chickens were housed.\\nNeuro-anatomically, lesions may involve anterior horn cell (causing a  motor  neuronopathy),  nerve  root  (radiculopathy),  dorsal  root ganglion  (sensory neuronopathy), brachial or  lumbo-sacral plexus, sensory  and  motor  nerve,  motor  nerve  only,  sensory  nerve  only (large  and/or  small  fibers),  neuromuscular  junction  and  muscle (Fig. 10.2).\\n---\\n[OTHER CONDITIONS RELATED TO HTLV INFECTION]\\nContent: A myriad  of  infectious  diseases  including  Norwegian  scabies, molluscum  contagiosum,  extrapulmonary  histoplasmosis,  tuberculosis, leprosy, and strongyloidiasis are described in case reports and series of HTLV-1-infected persons. A review of over 1200 blood donors in the  USA  revealed  a  significantly  higher  incidence  of  kidney  and bladder infections with HTLV-I infection. HTLV-II-infection was associated with higher incidence of bronchitis, bladder or kidney infections, and oral herpes. There was also a trend toward higher incidence of pneumonia in HTLV-II patients [2].\\nDermatologic alterations are commonly seen in the setting of HTLV infection and include dermatophyte infections, seborrheic dermatitis, acquired  ichthyosis,  infective  dermatitis  (Fig.  34.9.4),  scabies,  and others.\\nPatients with HTLV-1 also have an increased incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium infections, as well as decreased skin response rates to purified protein derivative. Increased rates of HTLV-1 infections are also seen among residents of Hansen's disease sanatoriums in Africa [16].\\nOther neurologic syndromes, which do not meet the case definition of  HAM/TSP,  include  leg  weakness,  impaired  gait,  hyper-reflexia, impaired vibratory sense, and urinary tract abnormalities [1].\\nA  myriad  of  rheumatologic  conditions  are  described  with  HTLV-1 detected  in  target  tissues.  These  conditions  include  polymyositis, bronchioalveolar pneumonitis, Sjögren's syndrome autoimmune thyroiditis, uveitis, and arthropathy [6, 7].\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Approximately 80% of human WNV infections are asymptomatic [7]. In clinical infections, the incubation period usually is 2-6 days, but can be up to 21 days in immunocompromised people. Most symptomatic persons experience an acute systemic febrile illness that often includes headache, myalgia or arthralgia; gastrointestinal symptoms and a transient maculopapular rash also are commonly reported. Less than  1%  of  infected  people  develop  neuroinvasive  disease,  which typically manifests as meningitis, encephalitis, or acute flaccid paralysis.  Patients  with  encephalitis  may  present  with  seizures,  mental status changes, focal neurologic deficits or movement disorders. WNV acute flaccid paralysis is often clinically and pathologically identical to  poliomyelitis  caused  by  polioviruses,  with  damage  of  anterior horn cells in the spinal cord (anterior myelitis); it  may progress to respiratory paralysis requiring mechanical ventilation. WNVassociated Guillain-Barré syndrome has also been reported and can be distinguished from WNV myelitis by clinical manifestations and electrophysiologic testing. Cardiac dysrhythmias, myocarditis, rhabdomyolysis, optic neuritis, uveitis, chorioretinitis, orchitis, pancreatitis and hepatitis have been rarely described after WNV infection.\\nMost  patients  with  WNV  non-neuroinvasive  disease  or  meningitis recover completely, but fatigue, malaise and weakness can linger for weeks or months [7, 8]. Patients who recover from WNV encephalitis or  myelitis  often  have  residual  neurologic  deficits.  Among  patients with  neuroinvasive  disease,  the  overall  case-fatality  rate  is  approximately 10%, but it is significantly higher in WNV encephalitis and myelitis than in WNV meningitis. Risk factors for developing neuroinvasive disease include older age and history of solid organ transplantation;  other  immunocompromising  conditions,  diabetes,  and hypertension are suspected risk factors.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Neurolathyrism\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is neurolathyrism, a preventable toxic myelopathy caused by excessive ingestion of the grass pea, Lathyrus sativus. This is supported by the classic clinical presentation of an irreversible, acute-onset spastic paraparesis without sensory or sphincter involvement. The diagnosis is strongly corroborated by the epidemiological context: the patient's diet consisted almost exclusively of grass peas during a famine, he was a young male performing hard physical labor, and other young men in his village were similarly affected. Alternative diagnoses such as other tropical myelopathies were ruled out by the specific clinical features and exposure history.\\nContent: Ten years ago, the patient woke from sleep and noticed weakness in both legs, with no preceding trauma or prodromal symptoms. The weakness progressed rapidly over 4 to 5 days, after which he required a cane for mobility. The condition has been stable since. He reported no back pain, sensory complaints, sphincter disturbance, or upper limb symptoms.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

Toxin-induced  secretory  diarrhea  continues  independent  of  food intake. Malabsorption of carbohydrate in the small intestine leads to fermentation of unabsorbed substrates by colonic bacteria; this may cause bloating, the passage of much rectal gas and frothy stools, which are all characteristic of giardiasis. Cryptosporidiosis can involve both small and large bowel, causing short-lived and self-limiting diarrhea; however, the infection can be prolonged in patients with impaired immune responses. Cyclospora cayetanensis can also cause  acute and more chronic diarrhea with abnormalities of intestinal absorption.\\nFrequent  bowel  movements  with  small  volumes  of  stool  and  the passage  of  blood  and  mucus  suggest  colonic  infection.  Causes  of bloody diarrhea (dysentery) include invasive bacteria such as Campylobacter spp., enterohemorrhagic E. coli , and Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia spp.; nonbacterial causes include Entamoeba histolytica (amebic dysentery) and Balantidium coli , which is spread by close contact with pigs. Colicky abdominal pain is common in many gut infections and is especially severe in campylobacteriosis and yersiniosis, mimicking acute appendicitis. Fever, chills and generalized myalgia are usually associated with infection by invasive organisms; these patients appear ill and have generalized abdominal tenderness.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS]\\nContent: The onset of symptoms can vary from a few hours after ingesting food containing preformed toxins, to several days after ingesting bacterial pathogens, to two or more weeks in parasitic infections. Acute infectious  diarrhea  can  be  classified  into  watery  diarrhea  and  bloody diarrhea (dysentery) (Box 3.1). Noninfectious causes of acute diarrhea are less significant in the tropics, but causes that should be considered include toxin-induced (e.g. organophosphate poisoning), medicationrelated and ischemic colitis. The most important physical signs to be\\n---\\n[SYMPTOMS]\\nContent: Intense gastrointestinal symptoms  will  follow ingestion within 30 min  to  a  few  hours.  Diarrhea  may  sometimes  become  bloody. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance may follow and, in severe cases, renal dysfunction  might  ensue.  Occasionally,  cholinergic  symptoms  are observed.\\n---\\n[GASTROINTESTINAL IRRITANTS]\\nContent: Ingestion of  many  plants  may  cause  gastroenteritic  symptoms (abdominal colic, vomiting, and diarrhea) as the sole toxic manifestation.\\nOxalic acid and calcium oxalate crystals occur in a number of popular decorative  plants,  such  as  'dumb  cane'  ( Dieffenbachia spp.),  'elephant's ear' ( Philodenron spp.) and 'cuckoo pint' ( Arum maculatum ). The  crystals  cause  intense  irritation  of  mucous  membranes  in  the mouth, esophagus, stomach and intestine. Increased salivation, reddening, blistering, and dysphagia may ensue. Other decorative plants, for example Euphorbia and Daphne spp. contain highly irritating diterpene esters that cause burning sensations and pain in the mucous membranes  of  the  gastrointestinal  tract  and  are,  in  general,  most pronounced in mouth and pharynx. Other symptoms are increased salivation, reddening and blisters.\\nSome of these toxins may also cause skin lesions and minor renal damage (see below).\\nTreatment is with oral fluids to rinse and dilute the irritant material, together with symptomatic care as required.\\n---\\n[COMPLICATIONS]\\nContent: The leading cause of death in patients with acute diarrhea is dehydration, which requires prompt fluid and electrolyte replacement. The nutritional state of children  often  deteriorates  because of anorexia, nutrient malabsorption, and the practice of not feeding children who have diarrhea. Hypolactasia is a sequela of many gut infections and may cause persistent diarrhea. Dysentery can be associated with severe local complications such as hemorrhage, toxic megacolon and bowel\\nperforation.  In  addition,  invasive  organisms  can  result  in  systemic manifestations  including  hemolytic  uremic  syndrome  (which  can complicate Shigella dysenteriae and E.  coli O157 infections), reactive arthritis  (following  shigellosis,  salmonellosis,  campylobacteriosis, yersiniosis, and Clostridium difficile infection) and Guillain-Barré syndrome (campylobacteriosis).\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

I tried to tan them away at the beach, but the spots just stayed white while the rest of my skin got darker, making them look even more obvious. They also get a little itchy when I work out and get sweaty. What could be causing this?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[PHYSICAL EXAM]\\nDisease: Pellagra\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is Pellagra, a nutritional disorder caused by a deficiency of vitamin B3 (niacin). The diagnosis was made clinically based on the characteristic triad of photosensitive dermatitis, watery diarrhoea, and neuropsychiatric symptoms ('dementia'). The diagnosis was confirmed by the rapid resolution of her confusion and diarrhoea following supplementation with a vitamin B-complex. Her poor, maize-based diet provided a strong epidemiological link, and other key differential diagnoses like HIV were ruled out by testing.\\nVitals: The patient is afebrile. Her Glasgow Coma Scale is 14/15 due to confusion. Remaining vital signs are reported as normal.\\nContent: The patient is slim but not wasted. Her conjunctivae are pale. There is a noticeable, clearly demarcated skin rash on her neck ('Casal’s necklace'), forearms, hands, and feet, where the skin appears hyperpigmented, dry, and scaly. There is no neck stiffness, and the rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Stevens-Johnson syndrome\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), a severe drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction. This clinical diagnosis is based on the patient's generalized maculopapular rash with extensive mucous membrane involvement (oral, conjunctival, genital), which appeared approximately four weeks after starting nevirapine and co-trimoxazole, both of which are highly implicated drugs. The diagnosis is further supported by the much higher incidence of SJS in HIV-positive individuals. Infectious causes like malaria were ruled out with negative testing.\\nVitals: Temperature is 37.7°C (99.9°F), blood pressure is 120/68 mmHg, pulse is 90 bpm, and respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute.\\nContent: The patient developed a productive cough with whitish sputum, followed one day later by a generalized skin rash that started on her trunk and spread to the extremities and mucosal membranes. Over the past two days, she also developed a sore throat and dysuria. The rash involves her lips, oral mucosa, conjunctivae, and genital mucosa, and has made talking and eating difficult and painful.\\n---\\n[PHYSICAL EXAM]\\nDisease: Crusted scabies\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was crusted scabies with secondary community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) sepsis. The crusted scabies was confirmed by microscopy of skin scrapings showing numerous mites and eggs. The secondary MRSA bacteremia was confirmed by blood cultures. The diagnosis was further supported by her clinical presentation of a classic hyperkeratotic rash with signs of septic shock and her complete recovery following targeted anti-scabietic and antibiotic therapy.\\nVitals: On initial presentation, her temperature was 39.5 °C (103.1 °F), heart rate was 110 bpm, respiratory rate was 28 breaths per minute, and blood pressure was 85 mmHg systolic. Her oxygen saturation was 92% on room air.\\nContent: The patient was pale, clammy, and poorly responsive. She had a widespread exfoliative rash involving all limbs, with particular severity in the armpits, buttocks, and thighs. Numerous flakes of skin were present on her mattress. She also had fissures over her wrists and knees.\\n---\\n[DISSEMINATED PRURITUS WITH OR WITHOUT RASH]\\nContent: Scabies is the most common cause of diffuse pruritic skin disease [4]. The patient complains of generalized and intense itching, worsening at  night,  usually  sparing  the  face  and  head.  Specific  skin  findings include 5- to 10-mm burrows, and papulonodular genital lesions. The classic  distribution of lesions are the interdigital web spaces, flexor surfaces of the wrists, the elbows, the axillae, the buttocks and genitalia, and on the breasts of women. Other skin changes are secondary to pruritus and include excoriation and lichenification.\\nCiguatera is a cause of localized pruritic neurosensory manifestations (perioral and distal extremity paresthesias) without cutaneous manifestations. There should be a history of fish consumption, other cases among travelers sharing the  same  meal,  a  short  incubation  period\\n(2-30 hours), and the association of gastrointestinal and neurological signs. The latter can last for months after the initial event. This fish poisoning is acquired by the ingestion of fish containing the toxins produced by the dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus toxicus , which is found in damaged coral reef systems in tropical and subtropical regions.\\nSeabather's eruption (also called sea lice) is a highly pruritic maculopapular  eruption  that  occurs  after  swimming  in  the  ocean  and  is generally confined to the skin under swimwear. It is caused by larval forms of sea  anemones  (e.g. Edwardsiella  lineata )  and  jellyfish  (e.g. Linuche unguiculata ) that become trapped under swimwear.\\nCercarial dermatitis (swimmer's itch) is also a pruritic maculopapular eruption but is predominantly distributed on uncovered body areas. It  results  from  penetration  of  the  skin  by  cercariae  of  nonhuman schistosomes while swimming in fresh water. It can last for several days.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Cutaneous larva migrans\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is cutaneous larva migrans (CLM), caused by the accidental infestation of human skin by larvae of dog and cat hookworms. This was diagnosed clinically based on the pathognomonic finding of pruritic, serpiginous tracks on the skin, supported by a clear exposure history of skin contact with sand in an endemic area (Thailand/Australia). The diagnosis was confirmed by the rapid and complete resolution of symptoms after a single dose of ivermectin.\\nContent: The patient developed three intensely itchy skin eruptions on both upper thighs just after arriving in Australia, one week prior to presentation.

He plays on a wrestling team and shares helmets sometimes. Could this be dandruff or something else?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[TINEA CAPITIS (RINGWORM OF THE SCALP)]\\nContent: Invasion of scalp hairs is seen with certain dermatophytes. In some, particularly those spread from animals, scalp hairs often break several millimeters above  the  skin  surface.  There  can  be  considerable exudation  and  erythema.  In  other  infections,  including  many  of those spread from child to child, the onset is insidious. Hairs break at scalp level and inflammation can be minimal. Most cases present with hair loss, usually in patches, and a varying degree of scaling (Fig. 77.4).  However,  kerions  (very  inflammatory  pustular  lesions)  can develop.\\nFIGURE 77.4 Tinea capitis, caused by Microsporum audouinii , presents with multiple patches of alopecia with scaling in this boy (image courtesy of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Photograph Neg. 7-6860).\\nFavus,  a  scalp  infection  seen  in  some  parts  of  Africa,  for  example Ethiopia,  presents with hair loss accompanied by the formation of crusts  or  scutula.  These  tend  to  coalesce  to  form  a  dense  mat  in patches or large areas of the scalp. The diagnosis of tinea capitis is facilitated  by  filtered  ultraviolet  light  examination  (Wood's  light), although only Microsporum species fluoresce under these conditions. Ringworm of the scalp must be distinguished from seborrheic dermatitis,  psoriasis,  or  cicatricial  alopecia.  The  last  may  be  produced  in end-stage favus.\\n---\\n[PHYSICAL EXAM]\\nDisease: Measles\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is measles, caused by a paramyxovirus. This was determined clinically based on the pathognomonic triad of cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis, followed by the characteristic maculopapular rash starting behind the ears and spreading to the trunk. The patient's HIV-positive status predisposed him to severe complications, including pneumonia and encephalitis (suggested by the low Blantyre Coma Scale). The diagnosis was supported by the exclusion of malaria via negative smears.\\nVitals: On examination, the patient had a temperature of 39.8° C (103.6 °F) and was noted to have laboured breathing.\\nContent: The patient was a sick child with a Blantyre coma score of 3/5. Examination revealed coryza and bilateral conjunctivitis. A fine maculopapular rash was present behind both ears and on the forehead. There was also bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy. Koplik's spots were not reported.\\n---\\n[PHYSICAL EXAM]\\nDisease: Onchocerciasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is onchocerciasis (river blindness), caused by the filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus. The diagnosis was established based on the highly typical clinical triad of chronic pruritic dermatitis, subcutaneous nodules over bony prominences, and characteristic corneal opacities (sclerosing keratitis). This is strongly supported by the patient's lifelong residency in an endemic region of Togo near a fast-flowing river, the known breeding site for the Simulium blackfly vector.\\nContent: Examination reveals opacities in the cornea of both eyes, described as keratitis semilunaris, a form of band-shaped sclerosing keratopathy. The skin appears atrophic in some areas with loss of elasticity, and there are multiple scratch marks. Multiple firm, non-tender subcutaneous nodules, measuring 1 to 3 cm in diameter, are palpable over bony prominences including the ribs, iliac crest, femoral trochanters, and on the head.\\n---\\n[PAPULOSQUAMOUS AND ECZEMATOID LESIONS]\\nContent: Papulosquamous  lesions  are  rashes  that  are  both  raised  and  have scale, such as psoriasis and tinea corporis (Table 8-1). In tineasis, the dermatophytes Microsporum , Trichophyton and Epidermophyton infect keratinized  tissue.  Characteristically,  they  appear  as  erythematous, annular plaques, with serpiginous borders, with scale at the leading edge,  and  are  named  based  on  the  location  of  involvement:  tinea capitis - scalp; tinea corporis - body; tinea faciei - face; tinea cruris -  groin;  tinea  pedis  -  feet;  tinea  manuum  -  hand;  tinea  barbae  beard;  tinea  unguium -  nails. Diagnosis  can  be  confirmed  by  performing a  scraping  of  the  scale  and  applying  one  or  two  drops  of potassium  hydroxide  (KOH)  and  visualizing  the  hyphal  structures under  10 × magnification.  The  differential  diagnosis  includes  other papulosquamous or scaly raised lesions (see Table 8-1). For limited disease, topical antifungals are usually effective, except for tinea capitis and onychomycosis, which often require oral antifungal medications. As  recurrence  is  common,  multiple  courses  of  therapy  are  often required.\\nTinea capitis causes circular, scaly patches on the scalp with alopecia and black dots caused by breakage of the hair shaft. Some causative species such as Microsporum audouinii fluoresce on Wood's lamp examination. Favus is a particular type of tinea capitis which causes yellow, concave  cup-shaped  crusts  on  the  scalp  around  loose  hairs  and  is caused by T. schoenleinii . There is a characteristic mousy odor which aids  in  the  diagnosis.

They seem to burst and then crust over with a honey-colored scab. He’s been scratching them a lot, and now I see a few similar spots starting on his hands. It’s warm and humid right now, so I thought it might be bug bites, but they look different. What could this be?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Bites,  for  example  by  the  large  aggressive  flies  variously  known  as horse flies, gadflies or cleggs (Tabanidae), may be immediately painful and traumatic but the commonest problem is delayed local swelling and itching from exposure to insects' salivary allergens incurred by previous bites. A small, intensely itchy, reddish lump with a central (hemorrhagic)  punctum  develops  immediately  or  after  a  delay  of 24-48 hours. A papule, urticarial weal, blister or bulla may develop (e.g.  after  'Blandford  fly' Simulium posticatum bites  in  Oxfordshire, UK), or bites may provoke a more generalized erythema multiforme or,  especially  in  children,  papular  urticaria,  and  sometimes  even systemic  anaphylaxis  may  be  provoked.  Triatomine  bug  bites  are usually multiple - often near the eye or angle of the mouth. They are painful, swollen, ooze blood and may be surrounded by black staining from the bug's feces (see Chapter 98, 'Chagas' Disease'). Scratching may lead to secondary infection, an inflamed, painful pustule or carbuncle, or a demarcated, hot, bright red, raised area of erysipelas or cellulitis. Causative bacteria include Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes . The risk of secondary infection seems to be higher under humid tropical conditions. It may be difficult to distinguish between  envenoming  or  allergy,  resulting  in  early  symptoms  after minutes or a few hours, and infection, resulting in late symptoms after many hours or even days.\\nFIGURE 136.2.1 Bug bite, São Paulo, Brazil (© David A. Warrell).\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Burrows most commonly occur in the interdigital clefts between the fingers  and  on  the  wrists,  but  may  be  widespread  (Fig.  136.4.1). Tracks  are  serpiginous,  extending  for  a  few  millimeters  up  to  one centimeter,  creating  linear  papulovescular  lesions  with  excoriation, secondary  infection,  eczematization,  lichenification  and  erythematous papules. Lesions are intensely itchy, especially at night and after a  hot  bath  or  shower, provoking scratching -  excoriation that promotes secondary infection. In about 7% of cases, very itchy reddish brown  nodules  occur  on  the  genitalia,  groin,  buttocks  and  axillae (nodular scabies). In infants, vesicular, pustular and nodular lesions are found on the axillae, head, face, diaper region, palms and soles. An exuberantly crusting form, Norwegian scabies, occurs in patients immunosuppressed by HIV, human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-1 or by drugs employed in organ transplantation, and in people with trisomy-21. Demarcated, hyperkeratotic, scaly plaques involve, in particular,  the  extremities,  scalp,  face,  neck  and  buttocks.  The  scales contain thousands of mites and the load per patient may exceed 1 million mites. This type of scabies is very infectious and a single case can give rise to nosocomial outbreaks.\\n---\\n[HAND-FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE]\\nContent: Hand-foot-and-mouth disease occurs most often in children under 10 years of age. The illness commences with fever ( > 38.5°C) and sore throat. The fever lasts 1-2 days during which time vesicles appear on the  anterior  buccal  and  gingival  mucous  membranes  and  tongue. Cutaneous vesicles occur most frequently on palms of the hands and soles  of  the  feet,  but  may  also  occur  on  the  buttocks  and  extensor surfaces of the elbows and knees. The skin lesions of hand-foot-andmouth disease are typically tender vesicles with a surrounding zone of erythema (Fig. 34.2.4).\\n---\\n[FIXED LOCALIZED PAPULES AND NODULES]\\nContent: There are several causes of fixed papules and nodules (Box 147.3). Myiasis  and  tungiasis  are  among  the  most  common.  Myiasis  is infestation of human tissue by larvae or maggots of flies ( Diptera ).

A  large,  tender, cyst-like  structure  or  papule  may  be  noted  with  surrounding  erythema,  a  central  punctum  and  occasional  suppuration.  Patients usually report movement within the lesions. Lesions may be multiple. New World myiasis is caused by the botfly; Old World disease is most commonly caused by the tumbu fly. Treatment involves asphyxiating the  larvae,  usually  via  application  of  an  occlusive  dressing  or  substance, followed by larval extrusion. Surgical excision may sometimes be required. Bacterial suprainfection can occur.\\nTungiasis (also called jiggers) is caused by Tunga penetrans , the sand flea. The female flea burrows into skin, usually on the feet, but can involve any exposed skin area, creating a callus-like papule, often with some hyperpigmentation. The terminus of the flea is often visible in the center of the lesion. Pain is usually present. Treatment involves mechanical removal.\\nMany insect bites  and  plant  dermatitides  occur  in  the  tropics.  The physical  examination  is  often  helpful  at  suggesting  the  diagnosis. Insect bites may result in erythematous papules of variable size and distribution. Urticarial-like erythema is seen around lesions, at times enlarging far over 10 cm in diameter. A number of beetles, millipedes and  centipedes  can  cause  a  severe  contact  dermatitis.  Plant  dermatitides may manifest in both acute and chronic forms, depending on the repetitive nature of contact. Whereas contact dermatitis is the most  common  presentation,  characterized  by  vesicles  on  an  erythematous base in a linear or geographic distribution, chronic disease may present as eczematous dermatitis. Occupational disease, as seen in florists or gardeners, can present as atopic dermatitis of the hands, with severe dryness, scaling, cracking, erythema, and even fibrotic-like constriction in palmar function.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

When I got out of the water, I saw red, raised lines where it hurt, and it was throbbing. A friend told me I should pee on it to stop the pain, but that sounds gross and I'm not sure if it works. What happened to me, and how should I actually treat it?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[TREATMENT]\\nContent: Hot water (see above) may relieve the pain. Spines should be squeezed out or removed surgically, but this may prove impossible. There is a risk of marine bacterial infections (see above).\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Acute transverse myelitis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is acute transverse myelitis of idiopathic etiology. This is based on the clinical syndrome of acute flaccid paraparesis with a T10 sensory level and bladder dysfunction, supported by cerebrospinal fluid evidence of inflammation (lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein). Extensive investigations, including serologies and CSF analysis, ruled out common infectious causes like HIV, syphilis, tuberculosis, and schistosomiasis. Normal spinal x-rays made a compressive lesion unlikely.\\nVitals: On presentation, vital signs were normal.\\nContent: The patient was well until two days prior to presentation, when she developed acute back pain that radiated in a band-like fashion to her umbilicus. The pain was severe, continuous, and burning. Within 12 hours, the pain subsided but she developed ascending numbness in her feet and legs up to her waist, followed by loss of leg power and bladder control. She reported a febrile illness three weeks previously, which was treated as malaria. There was no history of trauma.\\n---\\n[TREATMENT]\\nContent: Treatment is common to all wounds caused by venomous fish and includes: (i) pain relief; (ii) neutralizing effects of venom; (iii) prevention of secondary infection; and (iv) supportive care of systemic symptoms.  Immersion  of  the  stung  part  in  uncomfortably  hot,  but  not scalding, water (less than 45°C) relieves pain and neutralizes venom. Alternatively,  inject  local  anesthetic  as  a  ring  block  or  local  nerve block. The barbed venomous spine, its covering membrane and other foreign  material  should  be  removed  as  soon  as  possible.  Systemic effects  are  treated  symptomatically.  Cardiopulmonary  resuscitation may  be  required  on  the  beach.  In  Australia,  CSL  (Melbourne, Australia) manufacture an antivenom specific for Synanceja trachynis, Synanceja  verrucosa ,  and Synanceja  horridus which  has  paraspecific activity against venoms of North American scorpion fish ( Scorpaena guttata ) and some other Scorpaenidae.

The envenomation was most likely caused by an African puff-adder (*Bitis arietans*), based on the snake's distinct physical description, its behavior, the geographic location in Malawi, and the clinical presentation of severe local cytotoxic effects (haemorrhagic bullae, massive swelling, extensive necrosis) and initial systemic haematotoxicity (bleeding gums). The patient's septic shock on arrival was a late complication of the untreated necrotic wound.\\nVitals: On admission, the patient appeared weak and was in respiratory distress. His temperature was 39.4 °C, pulse 126 bpm, blood pressure 85/60 mmHg, and respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute.\\nContent: There was an extensive, foul-smelling necrosis affecting his right foot and ankle, with exposed tendons. The right lower leg was swollen, and he was unable to bend his right ankle. Inguinal lymph nodes on the right side were enlarged. His urine was clear, a rectal exam showed no signs of bleeding, and there was no haemoptysis on provoked coughing.

The patient was diagnosed with sepsis and managed according to international guidelines, including broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and ventilatory support. He received tetanus prophylaxis. The necrotic wound on his foot was managed surgically with several debridements, followed by successful mesh-grafting.

It  is  a  syndrome  that  may  be  caused  by Candida species, erythrasma or Gram-negative bacteria, as well as by dermatophytes. In dermatophyte infections, the area between the toes may be wet or dry and, in some infections, particularly those caused by Trichophyton interdigitale , vesicular. Involvement of the dorsum of the foot or the sole may occur. The commonest cause is T. rubrum .\\nSymptoms may be minimal. It is more common in people who wear shoes and socks and is therefore associated with urban areas in the tropics.\\nTinea pedis in tropical areas must be distinguished from eczema and, less commonly, plantar psoriasis [4].

Given these definitive clinical findings, diagnostic tests like skin biopsy or slit-skin smears were not required for confirmation.\\nContent: On examination, there is a 20 cm by 10 cm hypopigmented macule on the outer aspect of the right arm extending onto the forearm. The affected skin is dry, and sensation within the area is reduced compared to normally pigmented skin. The right ulnar nerve is palpably thickened, though the left is not. There is reduced sensation on the tip and ulnar border of the right little finger. No other neurological abnormalities were found, and the rest of the skin examination was normal.\\n---\\n[PHYSICAL EXAM]\\nDisease: Stevens-Johnson syndrome\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), a severe drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction. This clinical diagnosis is based on the patient's generalized maculopapular rash with extensive mucous membrane involvement (oral, conjunctival, genital), which appeared approximately four weeks after starting nevirapine and co-trimoxazole, both of which are highly implicated drugs. The diagnosis is further supported by the much higher incidence of SJS in HIV-positive individuals.

Examination reveals bilateral conjunctivitis, and the eyelids and lips are covered with haemorrhagic crusts. The lips are swollen, and she can hardly open her mouth. The chest is clear on auscultation.\\n---\\n[PHYSICAL EXAM]\\nDisease: Pellagra\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is Pellagra, a nutritional disorder caused by a deficiency of vitamin B3 (niacin). The diagnosis was made clinically based on the characteristic triad of photosensitive dermatitis, watery diarrhoea, and neuropsychiatric symptoms ('dementia'). The diagnosis was confirmed by the rapid resolution of her confusion and diarrhoea following supplementation with a vitamin B-complex. Her poor, maize-based diet provided a strong epidemiological link, and other key differential diagnoses like HIV were ruled out by testing.\\nVitals: The patient is afebrile. Her Glasgow Coma Scale is 14/15 due to confusion. Remaining vital signs are reported as normal.\\nContent: The patient is slim but not wasted. Her conjunctivae are pale.

However, neurologic symptoms are distinctive, suggesting some kind of neurotoxic seafood poisoning. Allergic reactions produce anaphylactic  symptoms  (pruritus,  urticaria,  erythema,  angioedema,  bronchospasm,  and  shock),  sometimes  within  minutes  of  ingestion.\\nUnless there is a past history of specific seafood allergy (e.g. to prawns, tuna) or an epidemiologic clue (several diners affected), it can be very difficult  to  distinguish  allergy  from  scombroid  poisoning,  but  the emergency treatment is the same for both etiologies.\\n---\\n[SEVERE DEHYDRATION ( ≥ 10% VOLUME LOSS)]\\nContent: - Decreased consciousness\\n- Hypotension\\n- Deep respirations with an increase in respiratory rate\\n- Cool extremities\\n- Peripheral cyanosis\\nelicited  concern the  assessment of hydration (Box 3.2); the patient should be weighed at first presentation, as weight gain or loss can be a valuable guide to the effectiveness of rehydration.\\nThe rapid onset of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea after food consumption is most often due to the ingestion of a preformed toxin produced by Staphylococcus aureus , Bacillus cereus or Clostridium perfringens .\\nLarge-volume watery diarrhea indicates a small bowel etiology, e.g. due  to V.  cholerae ,  enterotoxigenic E.  coli and  rotavirus  infections. Toxin-induced  secretory  diarrhea  continues  independent  of  food intake. Malabsorption of carbohydrate in the small intestine leads to fermentation of unabsorbed substrates by colonic bacteria; this may cause bloating, the passage of much rectal gas and frothy stools, which are all characteristic of giardiasis. Cryptosporidiosis can involve both small and large bowel, causing short-lived and self-limiting diarrhea; however, the infection can be prolonged in patients with impaired immune responses. Cyclospora cayetanensis can also cause  acute and more chronic diarrhea with abnormalities of intestinal absorption.\\nFrequent  bowel  movements  with  small  volumes  of  stool  and  the passage  of  blood  and  mucus  suggest  colonic  infection.  Causes  of bloody diarrhea (dysentery) include invasive bacteria such as Campylobacter spp., enterohemorrhagic E. coli , and Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia spp.; nonbacterial causes include Entamoeba histolytica (amebic dysentery) and Balantidium coli , which is spread by close contact with pigs. Colicky abdominal pain is common in many gut infections and is especially severe in campylobacteriosis and yersiniosis, mimicking acute appendicitis. Fever, chills and generalized myalgia are usually associated with infection by invasive organisms; these patients appear ill and have generalized abdominal tenderness.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: In  food-borne  disease,  the  neurologic  features  of  botulism  may  be preceded by abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, although at  the  time  of  neurologic  manifestation,  constipation  is  common. Such gastrointestinal  disturbance  has  not  been  reported  in  wound botulism and probably represents the effect of other bacteria and their toxins  co-contaminating  the  causative  improperly  preserved  food. Clinical  effects  of  botulinum  toxin  usually  become  evident  18-36 hours after consumption of the implicated foodstuff.\\n---\\n[SYMPTOMS]\\nContent: Gastrointestinal symptoms begin within a few hours post-exposure and disappear quickly.

Could I have picked up a parasite from the food?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS AND PATHOLOGY]\\nContent: Infection is spread by ingestion of several species of freshwater fish that have infectious larvae within muscle. The natural reservoir host has not been identified, but fish-eating water birds are probable. The custom  of  eating  raw  fish  probably  determines  transmission.  Outbreaks have occurred when fecal contamination of freshwater lagoons has allowed eggs from infected patients to be disseminated in large numbers to a local source of fish.\\nAfter  ingestion  of  infected  fish,  larvae  can  invade  the  small  bowel, causing a chronic malabsorption-diarrhea syndrome characterized by induration  and  villous  atrophy  which  is  most  prominent  in  the jejunum (Fig. 107.6).  Adult worms invade the mucosa and lamina propria. Although inflammation is not prominent around parasites, chronic inflammation is noted within the lamina propria. The small intestine can contain thousands of parasites because of the ability of the adult females to produce infectious larvae. The chronic, usually watery, diarrhea leads to electrolyte and protein abnormalities. Muscle wasting  and  myocardial  degeneration  ensue  terminally.  Death  has been attributed to hypokalemic or metabolic cardiomyopathy or to secondary infection of debilitated patients.\\n---\\n[MEDICAL HISTORY AND EXAMINATION]\\nContent: Within  endemic  areas,  schistosomiasis  must  be  suspected  in  all patients presenting any symptom, however vague, that can be related to the infection. In travelers and migrants, a careful residence or travel history can help establish the diagnosis of schistosomiasis [31, 33]. In several sub-Saharan areas, both S. mansoni and S. haematobium, and even S. intercalatum, can be contracted. The patient who has lived in,\\n877\\nor  visited,  endemic  areas  must  be  asked  about  skin  contact  with freshwater of any kind, even if considered locally as safe or snail-free. Contacts of any type or duration can lead to infection. The patient may, or may not, report itching or rash shortly after the water contact. Visual  inspection  may help  diagnose  'swimmers'  itch'  after  recent exposure.\\nA medical history may reveal intermittent symptoms since the potential exposure, including flu-like syndromes in the weeks or months thereafter. Malaise, fatigue,  muscle pains, appetite loss, intermittent diarrhea, vague abdominal pain and red or dark urine are potential warning signs - partly depending on the suspected species. A neurologic history and examination is performed to exclude early cerebrospinal involvement. Abdominal palpation may reveal hepatomegaly or  splenomegaly  of  varying  degrees  and  abdominal  tenderness  or distention, but also may be entirely negative.\\n---\\n[POISONING BY INGESTING CARP'S GALLBLADDER [4]]\\nContent: In parts of the Far East, the raw bile and gallbladder of various species of freshwater carp (e.g. grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idellus and Jullien's\\n133.3 Mushroom Poisoning\\nHans Persson golden carp Probarbus jullieni ) are believed to have medicinal properties.  Patients  in  China,  Taiwan,  Hong  Kong,  Japan,  Thailand  and elsewhere  have  developed  acute  abdominal  pain,  vomiting  and watery diarrhea 2-18 hours after drinking the raw bile or eating the raw  gallbladder  of  these  fish.  One  patient  developed  flushing  and dizziness.  Hepatic  and  renal  damage  may  develop,  progressing  to oliguric or non-oliguric acute  renal failure (acute  tubular necrosis).

Asymptomatic infections with Pseudoterranova spp.  may  come  to  medical  attention  when  the  patient coughs up a live or dead worm. This usually occurs within 48 hours of the ingestion of infected fish and may be preceded by a sensation of  feeling  a  worm  crawling  in  the  upper  esophagus  or  pharynx, termed 'tingling throat syndrome'.\\nGastric anisakiasis is heralded by the abrupt (generally 1-12 hours after  ingestion  of  raw  fish)  onset  of  severe  epigastric  pain,  nausea, vomiting, and low-grade fever (Fig. 121.3). There is frequently leukocytosis with intense eosinophilia. Untreated gastric disease may lead to  chronic,  ulcer-like  symptoms  and  can  be  more  difficult  to diagnose.\\nIntestinal  anisakiasis  is  characterized  by  intermittent  or  constant abdominal pain that may be severe enough to result in peritoneal signs or a partial bowel obstruction. Symptoms may not appear until 5 to 7 days or longer after ingestion of the anisakid larvae. Intestinal infections  predominantly  occur  in  the  terminal  ileum;  colonic  or jejunal  involvement  is  less  common.

For the last three days, he has noted bloating and distension after consuming milk products. While he has mild nausea, he reports no fever. His stools were initially watery, but after a 5-day course of ciprofloxacin from a local pharmacy (which ended two days ago), they are now three to four per day and described as mushy, greasy, and foul-smelling.\\n---\\n[ABDOMINAL DISTENSION]\\nContent: Abdominal distension may be due to gas, either within or outside the  bowel  lumen.  Extraluminal  gas  is  seen  in  bowel  perforation, which is a surgical emergency. Gaseous distension of the bowel may be due to mechanical obstruction or motility disorder. Bloating is a common symptom in lactose malabsorption, which is commonplace among Africans and Asians after childhood, and in irritable bowel syndrome.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Cholera\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is cholera, caused by Vibrio cholerae O1, Serotype Ogawa, biotype El Tor. This was established based on the classic clinical syndrome of profuse rice-water diarrhea leading to severe dehydration and shock, combined with a clear epidemiological link to a contaminated water source during an outbreak. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by stool microscopy showing characteristic motile bacilli inhibited by specific antiserum and by positive stool culture for V. cholerae.\\nVitals: On admission, the patient was afebrile with a pulse rate of 110 bpm (low volume) and a blood pressure of 90/50 mmHg. After initial intravenous rehydration, her pulse rate improved to 84 bpm and her blood pressure rose to 100/70 mmHg.\\nContent: The patient developed profuse, large-volume watery diarrhoea, passing 12 to 15 stools in the past day. The stools were described as resembling diluted milk or rice water with white flakes. The illness was notable for the absence of abdominal pain or fever. Approximately one hour prior to presentation, she became unresponsive, prompting her husband to bring her to the hospital.\\n---\\n[EPIDEMIOLOGY]\\nContent: The  differential  diagnosis,  at  the  beginning  of  the  illness,  would include pathogenic enteric bacteria or viruses. However, as the illness progresses, the differential would include other intestinal protozoa, including Giardia lamblia .  A  rare  cause  of  illness  in  travelers, Cystoisospora  belli ,  can  produce  a  prolonged  diarrhea  after  travel,  and  is sensitive to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Fatigue and weight loss can be caused by Entamoeba histolytica , but anorexia is not as prominent. Dientamoeba fragilis can cause prolonged, low-grade intestinal symptoms, but without anorexia or weight loss. Fatigue and weight loss can be due to tropical sprue, which is a rare cause of prolonged diarrhea  in  travelers.  Celiac  sprue  occasionally  manifests  during foreign travel.\\n---\\n[SMALL BOWEL]\\nContent: A  wide  variety  of  disease  processes  give  rise  to  similar  histologic abnormalities in the mucosa of the small intestine, resulting in predictable  clinical  manifestations.  The  first  event  is  infiltration  of lymphocytes into the epithelium, resulting in an intraepithelial lymphocytosis. Next, there is increased crypt cell proliferation, resulting in  crypt  hyperplasia.  Then,  loss  of  villous  cells  leads  to  increasing degrees of villous atrophy, eventually leading to a flat mucosa. As a consequence of  mucosal malabsorption, patients present with diarrhea,  steatorrhea  and  weight  loss.  Laboratory  studies  may  be helpful in defining the extent of the malabsorption syndrome. Anemia may result from deficiencies of iron, folate and/or vitamin B12 - the latter implying that the mucosal damage extends to involve the terminal ileum. Prolongation of the prothrombin time may be due to a deficiency of vitamin K (one of the fat-soluble vitamins, along with A, D and E), which occurs in fat malabsorption. Hypophosphatemia, hypocalcemia  and  an  elevated  alkaline  phosphatase  are  seen  in vitamin D deficiency, which may cause osteomalacia or osteoporosis. Conditions that cause these histologic abnormalities and present with these  clinical  and  laboratory  features  include  parasitic  infections, celiac disease, tropical sprue, bacterial overgrowth and Crohn's disease (Box 3.4). Similar clinical manifestations may be seen in other disorders with specific pathologic findings, such as intestinal lymphoma and amyloidosis. The general principles of treating disorders of the small intestinal mucosa include treating the underlying disease and correcting any nutrient deficiencies that may be present. In addition, a lactose-free, low-fat diet may be beneficial.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

Lately, I've had these weird, itchy swellings on my arms and legs that pop up for a few days and then vanish, only to appear somewhere else later. But what really terrified me was this morning—I looked in the mirror and saw a small, worm-like thread actually moving across the white part of my eye! It didn't hurt, but it was horrifying. What is inside me?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[CUTANEOUS MYIASIS [3, 4]]\\nContent: Human bot flies,  also  known  as  ver  macaque,  berne,  el  torsalo  or beefworm ( Dermatobia  hominis Oestridae),  are  a  common  cause  of dermal myiasis in Central and South America. Their eggs are deposited on biting arthropods, such as mosquitoes, which carry them to the  skin  of  the  host.  Here,  the  eggs  hatch  and  the  larvae  burrow into the skin. As the  larva grows  over a period of 10 weeks, a boil develops with a small aperture. Larvae may grow to more than 1 cm\\nremoval of the larvae, debridement of affected tissue and treatment of secondary infection. Reconstructive surgery may be required.\\nOPHTHALMOMYIASIS (OCULAR\\nMYIASIS) [5, 61\\nin  length  (Fig.  136.3.1A,  B).  An  early  symptom  is  sporadic  pain caused by the spiny larva. Unless the eye is involved, infestation is generally  harmless.  Secondary  infection  of  the  wound  is  the  most common complication.\\nTumbu flies, also known as putsi fIy or ver du cayor ( Cordylobia anthropophaga Calliphoridae),  occur  throughout  sub-Saharan  Africa  and southern  Spain.  Females  lay  their  eggs,  usually  on  urine-  or  fecescontaminated sand or moist soil, and on clothes hung outside to dry. Skin contact with viable ova on clothing results in infestation. Larvae penetrate the skin and grow rapidly to mature in about 10 days. A painful inflamed boil develops which seems to wriggle, exudes bloodstained pus and has a definite head, through which the larval spiracles may  protrude  (Fig.  136.3.2).  There  may  be  associated  fever  and lymphadenopathy.\\nLarvae of warble flies ( Hypoderma spp.)  and  horse bot  flies, Gasterophilus spp.  (Oestridae),  can  invade  human  skin  causing  intense itching and a creeping eruption.\\n---\\n[OPHTHALMOMYIASIS <OCULAR MYIASIS= [5, 6]]\\nContent: Human victims  may  give  a  history  of  having  been  buzzed  in  the face or struck on the eye by an insect and later of developing irritation and  redness  of  the  eye,  foreign  body  sensation,  pain,  lacrimation, palpebral edema and signs of purulent conjunctivitis or a stye (hordeolum). Oestrus  ovis larvae  rarely  develop  beyond  the  first  instar  in humans and so symptoms are self-limiting, but they may be more rapidly relieved by slit lamp examination and removal of larvae which cling to the conjunctivae and may cause follicular conjunctival reaction and pseudomembrane formation. Other causes of human ophthalmomyiasis  include Rhinoestrus  purpureum,  Dermatobia  hominis, Hypoderma spp.,  (Oestridae),  and Cochlyomyia  hominis,  Lucilia spp. and Phormia spp. (Calliphoridae). Larvae of Hypoderma, Cochlyomyia and Dermatobia are more dangerous as they may burrow into the eye, resulting  in  pain,  nausea  and  destruction.  They  must  be  surgically removed.\\nCongo floor maggots, larvae  of the fly Auchmeromyia luteola live  in earthen  floors  of  huts  throughout  tropical  Africa  between  latitudes 18°N and 26°S. They suck blood from those sleeping on the ground, causing local swelling and itching.\\n---\\n[EYE WORM]\\nContent: Subconjunctival  migration  of  the  adult  eye  worm  (Fig.  1 1 1.4),  is generally accompanied by transient swelling of the lid and intense\\nFIGURE 111.5 Loa loa microfilaria in a thick blood smear of peripheral\\nFIGURE 111.4 Subconjunctival migration of an adult Loa loa worm.\\nFIGURE 111.5 Loa loa micro:laria  in  a  thick  blood  smear  of  peripheral blood  stained  with  Dela:eld's  hematoxylin  (180 × ),  showing  the  sheath (clear halo) and nuclei extending to the tip of the tail.

Although  most  episodes  resolve  spontaneously  and completely, rare cases of retinal artery occlusion and macular retinopathy  due  to  aberrant  migration  of  the  adult  parasite  have  been reported.\\n---\\n[SUBCUTANEOUS DIRO.LARIASIS]\\nContent: The most dramatic presentation of subcutaneous dirofilariasis is the presence of a moving adult worm in the conjunctiva (Fig. 1 13.6). This is often accompanied by swelling of the eyelid and face and a burning sensation. Occasionally, worms are found in the retina or within the eye and present as eye pain and blurred vision. Subcutaneous lesions in  other  parts  of  the  body  present  as  small  (0.5-1.5 cm),  painless nodules that develop over days to weeks. The nodule may or may not be  painful,  erythematous,  and  accompanied  by  a  feeling  of  movement. Systemic signs are unusual. The most common locations are the eyelid,  scrotum, breast,  arm,  and  leg,  although  any  part  of  the body can be involved.\\n---\\n[NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY]\\nContent: Adult nematodes coil in the stomach muscles of the definitive host. Eggs are passed in feces and, when exposed to water, release larvae. These larvae are ingested by freshwater copepods that are ingested, in turn,  by  an  intermediate  host,  where  larvae  invade  and  lodge  in muscle. Humans acquire the parasite by consuming the second- or third-stage larvae from infected intermediate hosts or paratenic hosts. In humans, larvae cannot develop into adult worms and will penetrate the stomach wall and migrate randomly within the human host. These larvae measure  2.5-12.5 mm. The incubation  period, or the time between ingestion of a worm and the first appearance of cutaneous manifestations, is usually from 3 to 4 weeks, although it can be as long as several years. Untreated, the worm can live in humans for several years; therefore, a long, asymptomatic interval can be followed by a sudden recurrence of symptoms [7].\\nInfection results in nonspecific symptoms, such as fever, mild malaise, urticaria,  and  epigastric  pain,  followed  by  external  (cutaneous)  or internal  (visceral)  larva  migrans.  The  migrating  worm  produces several toxins (acetylcholine, hyaluronidase, proteolytic enzyme, and hemolytic substance). The pathologic picture of swelling and tracklike necrosis demonstrates an intense cellular infiltration with neutrophils,  mononuclear  cells,  plasma  cells,  and  large  numbers  of eosinophils. Allergic changes are seen with hyper-eosinophilia. The parasite can migrate to the ocular system and central nervous system (CNS) causing localized inflammation and destruction.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

Now, he’s starting to get these large, tight blisters on his stomach and in his armpits. They look filled with fluid and don't pop easily. He hasn't changed his laundry detergent or anything, but he did start a new diabetes medication recently. What could be causing this sudden blistering?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Stevens-Johnson syndrome\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), a severe drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction. This clinical diagnosis is based on the patient's generalized maculopapular rash with extensive mucous membrane involvement (oral, conjunctival, genital), which appeared approximately four weeks after starting nevirapine and co-trimoxazole, both of which are highly implicated drugs. The diagnosis is further supported by the much higher incidence of SJS in HIV-positive individuals. Infectious causes like malaria were ruled out with negative testing.\\nVitals: Temperature is 37.7°C (99.9°F), blood pressure is 120/68 mmHg, pulse is 90 bpm, and respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute.\\nContent: The patient developed a productive cough with whitish sputum, followed one day later by a generalized skin rash that started on her trunk and spread to the extremities and mucosal membranes. Over the past two days, she also developed a sore throat and dysuria. The rash involves her lips, oral mucosa, conjunctivae, and genital mucosa, and has made talking and eating difficult and painful.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Onchocerciasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is onchocerciasis (river blindness), caused by the filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus. The diagnosis was established based on the highly typical clinical triad of chronic pruritic dermatitis, subcutaneous nodules over bony prominences, and characteristic corneal opacities (sclerosing keratitis). This is strongly supported by the patient's lifelong residency in an endemic region of Togo near a fast-flowing river, the known breeding site for the Simulium blackfly vector.\\nContent: The patient has noticed changes in both eyes over the past 4 years, without current visual disturbances, but he is worried because adults in his village have gone blind after similar changes. For the past two decades, he has developed multiple painless bumps under his skin. He also suffers from intense itching of his skin that is severe enough to keep him awake at night.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: African tick-bite fever\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is African tick-bite fever, caused by Rickettsia africae. This was a clinical diagnosis based on the patient's presentation with fever after travel to an endemic area in Southern Africa, and the pathognomonic finding of an inoculation eschar with regional lymphadenitis. The primary differential of malaria was ruled out with negative blood tests. The patient's rapid clinical improvement on doxycycline therapy further supported the diagnosis.\\nVitals: On presentation, after taking 1g of paracetamol, his tympanic temperature was 37.5 °C (99.5 °F), pulse was 80 bpm, and blood pressure was 130/70 mmHg.\\nContent: A 52-year-old man presented to a tropical medicine clinic with a two-day history of fever, night sweats, and a frontal headache.

He did report having a skin lesion on his left upper thigh which he had covered with a plaster.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Giardiasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is giardiasis, caused by the protozoan parasite Giardia intestinalis. This was confirmed by direct microscopic identification of Giardia trophozoites and cysts in stool samples. The clinical presentation of greasy, foul-smelling stools, bloating, and evidence of carbohydrate malabsorption (positive reducing substances in stool) is classic for this infection.\\nVitals: The patient has no fever; no other vital signs are reported.\\nContent: For the past two weeks, the patient has experienced four to five episodes of loose stools per day, accompanied by weight loss, anorexia, malaise, flatulence, and abdominal cramping during defecation. For the last three days, he has noted bloating and distension after consuming milk products. While he has mild nausea, he reports no fever.

I smoke and have a family history of diabetes. Could this be more than just gingivitis?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[GENERAL ETIOLOGY]\\nContent: In general, the known causes for oral mucosal problems and tumors range from infectious agents - bacterial, viral and fungal infections - to trauma sustained over a long period as occurs in tobacco users either from smoke inhalation, heat from burning tobacco, or from specific components of the tobacco and any other substances with which  it  has  been  mixed.  The  effects  of  tobacco  use  appear  to  be exacerbated when combined with alcohol use. The cause of a number of invasive tumors, such as ameloblastomas, is not understood at the present time. Systemic diseases may also play a part in oral mucosal diseases.\\n---\\n[DENTAL CARIES]\\nContent: Dental caries is a chronic disease in which the composition of the oral flora is altered as a result of chronic consumption of high-sugar substances. This leads to demineralization of the enamel, eventually causing a dental cavity. Dental caries is a major oral health problem worldwide, and the incidence is increasing in developing countries as people  engage  in  Western  dietary  practices  [1 1].

Different etiologies can be expressed in similar ways. For  instance,  infections,  malignancies,  autoimmune  disorders  and blood dyscrasias can all produce painful mouth ulcers. Oral disease caused by fungal, bacterial or viral infections can also be commonly found in immunocompromised hosts. For instance, oral lesions are strongly associated with HIV infection such as pseudomembranous oral candidiasis, oral hairy leukoplakia, HIV gingivitis and periodontitis,  Kaposi  sarcoma  and  non-Hodgkin  lymphoma.  All  mucosal ulcers  of  the  oral  cavity  that  do  not  heal  or  do  not  show  signs  of\\nhealing  within  2  weeks  warrant  further  investigation.

Is this just normal aging?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Neurolathyrism\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is neurolathyrism, a preventable toxic myelopathy caused by excessive ingestion of the grass pea, Lathyrus sativus. This is supported by the classic clinical presentation of an irreversible, acute-onset spastic paraparesis without sensory or sphincter involvement. The diagnosis is strongly corroborated by the epidemiological context: the patient\\'s diet consisted almost exclusively of grass peas during a famine, he was a young male performing hard physical labor, and other young men in his village were similarly affected. Alternative diagnoses such as other tropical myelopathies were ruled out by the specific clinical features and exposure history.\\nContent: Ten years ago, the patient woke from sleep and noticed weakness in both legs, with no preceding trauma or prodromal symptoms. The weakness progressed rapidly over 4 to 5 days, after which he required a cane for mobility. The condition has been stable since. He reported no back pain, sensory complaints, sphincter disturbance, or upper limb symptoms.\\n---\\n[AGE3RELATED CONDITIONS]\\nContent: Age-related musculoskeletal disease accounts for an increasing share of  the  musculoskeletal  burden.  Degenerative  conditions  can  occur everywhere, but disability is greatest when weight-bearing joints are involved. Degenerative disease of joints can be primary (idiopathic) or secondary to a vast array of conditions: congenital (developmental dysplasia  of  the  hip,  talipes  equinovarus),  hereditary  (osteogenesis imperfecta, achondroplasia), infectious (sequelae of septic arthritis), angular deformities (Blount\\'s disease) or avascular necrosis (sickle cell disease, Legg-Perthes disease). They can also be the result of trauma, particularly of intra-articular fractures that have been unrecognized or neglected.\\nThe rise of adult diabetes is associated with an increased incidence of neuropathic joints, particularly around the foot and ankle. Chronic low back pain (LBP) and significant osteoporosis are becoming more widespread  (Fig.  13.6).  Metastases  to  the  bone  secondary  to  neoplasms are also likely  to  increase.  Clinical,  radiographic,  and  basic laboratory  parameters  can  be  used  for  diagnosis.  Inflammatory\\nFIGURE 13.6 Thermal graph of emerging conditions.\\narthropathies  are  also  increasingly  recognized.  Symptomatic  treatment  is  with  aspirin,  analgesics,  early  generations  of  nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and corticosteroids.\\nBack pain is common worldwide. With greater than 80-90% of the workforce  in  the  developing  world  undertaking  strenuous  physical labor, one might suspect that the prevalence of low back pain would be increased over that seen in industrialized nations. Osteoarthritis, spinal  stenosis,  disc  degeneration,  and  osteoporosis  all  increase  in aging populations.\\n---\\n[PATIENT INFORMATION]\\nDisease: Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis for both patients was Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome (HCPS), caused by Andesvirus (ANDV), a New World hantavirus. This was confirmed by PCR and serology. The diagnosis was strongly supported by the patients\\' travel history to the Chile-Argentinian border region, which is endemic for ANDV, their outdoor activities, and the clinical presentation of acute febrile illness with progressive respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, and in the wife\\'s case, multi-organ failure and hemorrhagic complications. Other respiratory viruses and many viral hemorrhagic fevers were ruled out by negative testing and incompatible incubation periods, leaving hantavirus as the most fitting explanation given the epidemiological context and clinical course.\\nVitals: For the husband on admission: BP 90/55 mmHg, pulse 120 beats per minute, oxygen saturation 94% on ambient air, and temperature 39°C (102.2°F). For the wife on admission (3 weeks after husband\\'s admission): normal blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen saturation, temperature 38.6°C (101.5°F).\\nContent: A 55-year-old Swiss couple, both fitness instructors, previously healthy and in their mid-50s, travelled for 3 months from Ecuador to Chile.\\n---\\n[CHIEF COMPLAINT]\\nDisease: Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy\\nDiagnosis Details: A presumed diagnosis of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) was made, likely as a form of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (PML-IRIS) given the onset after ART initiation. This diagnosis is supported by the clinical presentation of slowly progressive focal neurological deficits in a patient with advanced HIV (CD4 count 54/µL), and the characteristic MRI findings of multifocal, non-enhancing, T2 hyperintense white matter lesions without mass effect. The diagnosis was further supported by the lack of response to empirical therapy for toxoplasmosis and tuberculosis.\\nVitals: The patient was afebrile and her vital signs were reported as normal.\\nContent: Slowly progressive weakness of the left arm and leg over a duration of approximately 3 months.\\n---\\n[AGE3RELATED CONDITIONS]\\nContent: The morbidity associated with osteoporosis is secondary to fractures that occur in fragile low-density bone. Common fracture sites are the spine, hip and upper extremity. Spine and hip fractures are particularly debilitating. Vertebral compression fractures lead to deforming scoliosis  and  painful  nerve  root  compressions,  while  hip  fractures necessitate long periods of hospitalization and may be fatal in up to 20% of cases. Where there is dependence upon subsistence farming, a debilitating spine or hip fracture can be of severe detriment.\\nIncreasing age is a risk factor for the development of prostate, breast and lung cancers, each of which has a high propensity to metastasize to  bone. It  is  likely  that  there  will be an increase in the  burden  of secondary bone cancer. Slow development of many primary cancers, combined with lack of education and lack of access to chemotherapeutics  and  radiotherapy,  result  in  the  neglect  of  many  primary cancers. Disruption of the structural integrity of bone by cancerous lesions  reduces  the  load-bearing  capacity.  Pathologic  fractures  may result,  and should be suspected  in patients with nonspecific symptomatology  who  develop  a  fracture  with  a  mechanism  of  injury inconsistent with fracture severity.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.'},\n",

Because few long-time diabetics survive in the poor, rural communities of developing countries, diabetic retinopathy is less common than in developed countries and in increasingly affluent urban communities elsewhere. The major treatable component of the disease is the growth  of  neovascular  membranes  which  extend  into  the  vitreous from the  surface  of  the  optic  nerve  or  retina.  Timely  laser  therapy provides  substantial  benefit  and  dramatically  reduces  the  risk  of blindness. Laser treatment also benefits patients with fluid accumulation in the macula (macular edema) if they are treated early. Diabetics should have their eyes examined annually if possible to ensure that suitable laser treatment is applied prior to the development of sightthreatening complications.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT]\\nContent: - Initial white spot lesions : re-mineralize by coating the area with fluoridated toothpaste, varnish or gel repeatedly.\\n- Initial cavitation : small visible break in the surface enamel, in the enamel only, cover with fissure sealant.\\n- More extensive cavitation, but small :  clean  and  fill  with  glass ionomer cement, coat with fissure sealant.\\n- Cavitation  involving  outer  layer  of  dentine :  use  hand  instruments to remove undermined enamel; remove soft and decayed dentine; restore with glass ionomer cement.\\n- Cavitation with more extensive dentine involvement extending to  more than one surface of the tooth, but not entering the pulp cavity : refer for traditional restoration.\\n- Cavitation  with  pulpal  involvement :  treatment  of  choice  in resource-poor tropical  countries  is  tooth  extraction  under  local anesthesia.\\n- Management  of  infections  associated  with  pulpal  infections that  have  spread  to  surrounding  tissues :  spreading  infections from  periapical  abscesses  can  become  life-threatening.

Once the infection is under control, extract the tooth under local anesthesia.\\n---\\n[MANAGEMENT AND CLINICAL COURSE]\\nDisease: Buruli ulcer\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is Buruli ulcer, a necrotizing skin infection caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. The diagnosis was established based on the characteristic clinical presentation of progressive, indurated ulcers with undermined edges on the extremity of a child from an endemic region in West Africa. It was definitively confirmed by a positive PCR result for M. ulcerans from a wound swab. The paradoxical enlargement of one ulcer during therapy is a known phenomenon and not indicative of treatment failure.\\nVitals: On presentation, the patient had a pulse of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 100/70 mmHg, and a temperature of 37.9 °C (100.2 °F).\\nContent: Initial ineffective treatments included herbal remedies, diclofenac, dexamethasone, and oxacillin. After diagnosis, she received 8 weeks of specific antimycobacterial therapy along with adequate wound care using saline-soaked gauze and povidone-iodine. During treatment, the ulcer on the back of her hand healed almost completely, but the smaller ulcer paradoxically increased in size to 8x10 cm. Subsequently, she underwent surgical debridement and skin grafting, and the wrist contracture was corrected with physiotherapy, leading to an uneventful recovery.\\n---\\n[PHYSICAL EXAM]\\nDisease: Tungiasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is tungiasis, an infestation caused by the burrowing female sand flea, Tunga penetrans.

I looked inside his mouth with a flashlight and saw these little red bumps and blisters all over the back of his throat and on the roof of his mouth. He doesn't have a rash on his hands or feet. Is this strep throat?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Group A Streptococcus pharyngitis may be mild or associated with high fever,  tender  anterior  cervical  lymphadenopathy,  tonsillar  exudates and raised peripheral white cell count. Symptoms usually resolve after 3-5  days,  although  suppurative  complications  (which  are  now uncommon in industrialized settings) include peritonsillar and retropharyngeal  abscess,  suppurative  lymphadenitis,  otitis  media,  mastoiditis and  meningitis. Non-suppurative  complications  include scarlet fever, acute rheumatic fever or acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Scarlet fever is characterized by a diffuse blanching rash that spreads from the chest to the abdomen and extremities leaving a  sandpaper-like  texture  to  the  skin.  Desquamation  of  the  fingers, toes, groin and axilla occurs one or more weeks later. The tongue is frequently coated in a white film (white strawberry tongue) that eventually gives way to a beefy red appearance (red strawberry tongue). While most cases are benign, scarlet fever was often lethal in the preantibiotic era. Many cases likely represented what would be regarded today as streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS).\\nIn simple impetigo, infection is confined to the epidermis with the formation of superficial crusted lesions on the face or other exposed body  parts.  In  tropical  and  impoverished  settings  'pyodermatous' lesions may be pustular and ulcerative. Children are usually afebrile and otherwise well, although resolution of pyoderma may take many days and result in scarring. Erysipelas, which typically affects the face or  an  extremity,  is  a  painful  infection  of  the  dermis  resulting  in  a clearly  demarcated  red  and  raised  area  of  inflammation  and  often formation of superficial bullae. Cellulitis involves the deeper subcutaneous tissues  causing  a  more  diffuse  and  less  clearly  demarcated area of inflammation. Infection of the draining lymphatic tracts (lymphangitis) results in tender linear streaks extending from the site of infection. Unlike impetigo, cellulitis and erysipelas are usually associated with fever and systemic toxicity.\\n---\\n[PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS]\\nContent: Viruses  account  for  most  episodes  of  acute  pharyngitis  in  all  age groups. Group A Streptococcus is isolated in only 20-40% of cases of exudative pharyngitis in school-aged children and an even lower proportion  of  cases  in  younger  children  and  adults.  Recovery  of  the organism may not represent infection, but colonization. The distinguishing  features  of  Group  A Streptococcus pharyngitis  and  scarlet fever, and differential diagnoses, are detailed in Table 36-2.\\nStaphylococcus  aureus is  a  major  cause  of  community-acquired  pyogenic infection and an important differential diagnosis for invasive\\nGroup A Streptococcus infection, especially for skin and osteoarticular infections and necrotizing pneumonia. The features which may help to  distinguish  Group  A Streptococcus from S.  aureus and  other  skin infections are listed in Table 36-2. In addition, a form of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) may complicate S. aureus infection, and shares many features with STSS with the exception that it is more frequently associated with colonization rather than bacteremia or severe underlying infection.\\nInvasive infections resulting from trauma or bites, exposure to water or soil, or involving immunocompromised hosts (including diabetic foot infections) may be caused by a more expanded array of pathogens and therefore require broader empirical therapy and heightened efforts to obtain a microbiologic diagnosis [17].\\n---\\n[HAND-FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE]\\nContent: Hand-foot-and-mouth disease occurs most often in children under 10 years of age. The illness commences with fever ( > 38.5°C) and sore throat. The fever lasts 1-2 days during which time vesicles appear on the  anterior  buccal  and  gingival  mucous  membranes  and  tongue. Cutaneous vesicles occur most frequently on palms of the hands and soles  of  the  feet,  but  may  also  occur  on  the  buttocks  and  extensor surfaces of the elbows and knees. The skin lesions of hand-foot-andmouth disease are typically tender vesicles with a surrounding zone of erythema (Fig. 34.2.4).\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Stevens-Johnson syndrome\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), a severe drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction. This clinical diagnosis is based on the patient's generalized maculopapular rash with extensive mucous membrane involvement (oral, conjunctival, genital), which appeared approximately four weeks after starting nevirapine and co-trimoxazole, both of which are highly implicated drugs. The diagnosis is further supported by the much higher incidence of SJS in HIV-positive individuals. Infectious causes like malaria were ruled out with negative testing.\\nVitals: Temperature is 37.7°C (99.9°F), blood pressure is 120/68 mmHg, pulse is 90 bpm, and respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute.\\nContent: The patient developed a productive cough with whitish sputum, followed one day later by a generalized skin rash that started on her trunk and spread to the extremities and mucosal membranes. Over the past two days, she also developed a sore throat and dysuria. The rash involves her lips, oral mucosa, conjunctivae, and genital mucosa, and has made talking and eating difficult and painful.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Acute  rheumatic  fever  is  characterized  by  various  combinations  of fever, polyarthritis or arthralgias, carditis, characteristic rash (erythema marginatum), chorea and subcutaneous nodules [13] (Table 36-3). Chorea and insidious carditis can occur as a manifestation of acute rheumatic fever in the absence of other features. Severe or recurrent episodes of acute rheumatic fever may result in progressive damage to  the  mitral  valve  (and  sometimes  the  aortic  valve)  resulting  in incompetence and progressive heart failure (rheumatic heart disease). Over several years, the valve may eventually become stenotic. Acute post-streptococcal  glomerulonephritis  can  occur  1-2  weeks  after\\nthroat infection or a few weeks after Group A Streptococcus skin infection.  The  features  are  hematuria  (microscopic  or  gross),  edema (which may be most evident peri-orbitally) and hypertension. Severe cases can also be complicated by encephalopathy. The illness is generally benign in childhood, but there may be an appreciable mortality among adults as a result of renal and congestive cardiac failure. Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) is a term used to describe some children with tic or obsessive compulsive disorders in whom symptoms appear to develop or worsen following Group A Streptococcus infection. The existence of PANDAS is controversial [14]. Post-streptococcal reactive arthritis describes a syndrome of polyarthritis that differs from acute rheumatic fever by affecting a range of smaller joints, being relatively resistant  to  anti-inflammatory  treatment  and  not  being  associated with carditis, although cases of acute rheumatic fever have been misdiagnosed as post-streptococcal reactive arthritis [15, 16].\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

There is no history of trauma.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Amoebic liver abscess\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is an amoebic liver abscess, caused by Entamoeba histolytica. This is supported by the clinical triad of fever and tender hepatomegaly with right intercostal tenderness, imaging findings of a large solitary liver lesion with an elevated hemidiaphragm, and the aspiration of characteristic 'brownish pus'. The diagnosis was further confirmed by the patient's rapid clinical response to metronidazole therapy and the relevant epidemiological risk factor of consuming locally brewed alcohol known to be associated with amoebiasis.\\nVitals: On examination, the patient's temperature was 38.3 °C (100.8 °F), blood pressure was 100/80 mmHg, pulse was 102 bpm, and respiratory rate was 24 breath cycles per minute.\\nContent: For the past week, the patient experienced fever, chills, headache, and body aches, along with severe right-hypochondrial pain.

This was established based on the clinical signs of cardiac tamponade (hypotension, tachycardia, pulsus paradoxus, elevated JVP), radiographic evidence of a large pericardial effusion ('globular heart'), and the patient's HIV-positive status in a tuberculosis-endemic region. The diagnosis was functionally confirmed by the dramatic clinical improvement following pericardiocentesis and the successful outcome after initiating antituberculous and antiretroviral therapy.\\nVitals: The patient's pulse was regular at 130 bpm with a pronounced pulsus paradoxus of 15 mmHg. His blood pressure in the supine position was 90/60 mmHg. He was noted to be slightly breathless in the supine position.\\nContent: The patient was well until one month prior to presentation when he began experiencing a feeling of fullness in his upper abdomen.

The diagnosis was made endoscopically based on the characteristic cystoscopy findings of a hyperaemic mucosa with multiple ‘sandy patches.’ This was supported by the patient's severe renal failure, bilateral hydronephrosis on ultrasound, and a highly compatible epidemiological risk as a fisherman in Lake Malawi. His death was due to complications, likely bacterial peritonitis related to his peritoneal dialysis.\\nVitals: On admission, his blood pressure was 200/130 mmHg, pulse was 66 bpm, temperature was 36.8° C, and the respiratory rate was 32 breaths per minute.\\nContent: The patient presented with a 5-day history of progressive shortness of breath, orthopnoea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. He also developed continuous, dull bilateral flank pain and constant nausea over the past few days.

While any of the infectious causes of colitis may involve the rectum, isolated proctitis is more commonly a sexually transmitted infection (STI), usually seen in men who have sex  with  men  who  engage  in  unprotected  anal  intercourse  [20]. Common causes are gonorrhea, herpes simplex, lymphogranuloma venereum secondary to chlamydia (which is endemic in Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and Central and South America), and syphilis. Noninfectious  causes  of  proctitis  include  the  inflammatory  bowel diseases, radiation, ischemia and neoplasia. Infectious workup should include rectal swab cultures for  gonorrhea,  lymphogranuloma venereum and herpes simplex virus, and blood for syphilis serologic testing. STI testing should be performed prior to rectal examination, as some lubricants are bacteriostatic. Anoscopy may not be possible due to pain; if performed, the mucosa is seen to be edematous, erythematous and friable with exudates or ulceration. If the proctitis is likely  due  to  an  STI  but  the  causative  agent  is  unknown,  empiric antimicrobial therapy should be started; the combination of ceftriaxone,  doxycycline  and  valacyclovir is  effective against  the  four main causes. Sexual partners should be identified and treated; counseling regarding barrier protection is important, as proctitis increases the risk of HIV transmission.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

I'm shivering with chills, my heart is racing, and I feel extremely dehydrated. I have a history of psoriasis, but I recently stopped taking my oral steroids abruptly because I ran out. Could this be a bad flare-up?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[ERYTHRODERMA]\\nContent: Correctly  diagnosing  the  cause  of  diffuse  erythroderma  or  wholebody erythema presents a unique challenge to the physician. These patients may present with marked systemic symptoms, and can suffer severe morbidity from lack of epidermal barrier function, including dehydration,  infection  and  severe  pain.  Ectropion  may  be  seen. Diffuse erythema can lead to severe imbalances of electrolytes and minerals,  and  hypocalcemic  tetany  can  occur.  As  the  eruption improves,  generalized  exfoliation  is  the  norm.  The  evaluation  of patients with erythroderma often requires histopathologic evaluation, to exclude full-thickness epidermal necrosis, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). TEN is commonly caused by a drug, but infectious etiologies have also been implicated, particularly mycoplasma and herpetic infections.\\nErythroderma may be caused by severe drug reactions. The presence of small, superficial pustules may indicate exanthematous generalized pustular dermatosis (AGEP), most commonly caused by β -lactam and cephalosporin antibiotics. Patients  present with fever and can have peripheral blood leukocytosis, commonly prompting evaluation for an  infectious  disease.  A  similar  finding  may  be  noted  in  pustular psoriasis, which may occur in patients with no prior history of psoriasis. Though nail findings may be helpful in those with prior history, such findings may not be seen in those with an acute, first episode. Patients appear ill and are often hospitalized. Cultures of the pustules\\nFIGURE 8.6 Ichthyosis.

Though  oral  steroids  may  improve  symptoms,  upon  withdrawal, disease can re-flare.\\n---\\n[DIAGNOSIS]\\nContent: The  differential  diagnosis  of  heat  illness  requires  a  history  of  heat exposure,  a  detailed  physical  exam  and  bedside  studies.  Infectious etiologies and rare causes of hyperthermia need to be ruled out. The differential diagnosis should include malignant hyperthermia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, endocrine and hypothalamic disorders, and fictitious hyperthermia. Heat edema and heat syncope are suggested by advanced patient age, deconditioning, low cardiac reserve and recent arrival in the tropics from cooler regions. Miliaria, a distinct heat dermatosis, is differentiated from other tropical skin maladies  by  the  timing,  distribution  and  physical  appearance  of  skin vesicles.  Miliaria  responds  promptly  to  antihistamines  or  dilute topical chlorhexidine. Heat cramps are a second common malady in unacclimatized individuals;  diagnosis  is  suggested  by  resolution  of cramps with rest and cool treatment, stretching and fluids, and electrolyte  repletion.  The  two  most  dangerous  heat  illnesses  -  heat exhaustion and heat stroke - have overlapping clinical features and are discussed in greater detail below.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Stevens-Johnson syndrome\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), a severe drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction. This clinical diagnosis is based on the patient's generalized maculopapular rash with extensive mucous membrane involvement (oral, conjunctival, genital), which appeared approximately four weeks after starting nevirapine and co-trimoxazole, both of which are highly implicated drugs. The diagnosis is further supported by the much higher incidence of SJS in HIV-positive individuals. Infectious causes like malaria were ruled out with negative testing.\\nVitals: Temperature is 37.7°C (99.9°F), blood pressure is 120/68 mmHg, pulse is 90 bpm, and respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute.\\nContent: The patient developed a productive cough with whitish sputum, followed one day later by a generalized skin rash that started on her trunk and spread to the extremities and mucosal membranes. Over the past two days, she also developed a sore throat and dysuria. The rash involves her lips, oral mucosa, conjunctivae, and genital mucosa, and has made talking and eating difficult and painful.\\n---\\n[PATHOPHYSIOLOGY]\\nContent: Heat illnesses are the result of excessive heat loads from the environment, the body's inability to dissipate heat or a combination of the two. In healthy individuals, the body compensates for heat stress by thermoregulatory  processes  and,  less  effectively,  through  adaptive processes. As total body heat load rises, a sensitive thermoregulatory system responds by stimulating the pre-optic nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus, which causes the dilation of cutaneous blood vessels and an increase in sweat production [1 1]. Familiarity with the mechanisms  of  heat  loss  allows  the  clinician  to  diagnose  impaired  thermoregulation and select the optimum cooling strategy for different patients and different treatment settings. There are four primary strategies that humans use to dissipate heat to the surrounding environment:  evaporation,  radiation,  convection  and  conduction.  Care providers  who  understand  these  mechanisms  of  heat  loss  are  well positioned to exploit these mechanisms to greater effect using focal cold  therapy.  The  major  form  of  heat  loss  in  hot,  dry  climates  is evaporation of sweat  or surface water from the skin or pulmonary system. Each of the four physical methods of heat loss is enhanced by compensatory physiologic processes such as increased sweat production, respiration and cardiac output, alterations in cutaneous and splanchnic blood flow, and reduction in physical activity. The physical mechanisms of heat loss are summarized in Table 24-2.\\nPhysiologic thermoregulation expands upon physical mechanisms of heat loss through a combination of cutaneous vasodilation, increased sweat-based and  respiratory evaporative cooling, and  increased cardiac output. Environmental conditions greatly influence the efficiency of thermoregulation. For example, large temperature gradients between the body and surrounding air, convective loss from increased air movement, and low humidity all favor efficient cooling. Evaporative heat loss is limited by humidity greater than 75% and by impaired physiologic  responses  such  as  anhidrosis,  perfusion  abnormalities, low cardiac output and the effect of certain medications or ingested\\n---\\n[PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS]\\nContent: if sexually active.

RAD may follow, or accompany, a viral infection, but often persists after the viral infection has resolved, and may be triggered by other causes (e.g. indoor air pollution). Fever is often not present. Cough, particularly night-time coughing may be the primary sign. This may be diagnosed by a beta-agonist challenge, such as with an albuterol nebulizer and is appreciated by a decrease in respiratory rate (by ≥ 5 breaths/minute) and effort, and improved oxygen saturation.\\n---\\n[BRONCHIOLITIS]\\nContent: This is a distinct syndrome of infants and young children. The major symptom is wheezing, accompanied by flaring of the nostrils, use of accessory  respiratory  muscles  and  cyanosis  in  more  severe  cases. Direct viral infection of the bronchiolar epithelial cells, followed by necrosis, infiltration of lymphocytes, submucosal  swelling  and increased mucus secretion results in the formation of dense plugs of debris that cause impediment of airflow, particularly expiratory. Children  may  experience  repeated  episodes  of  wheezing  after  recovery from  bronchiolitis.  Associations  with  later  development  of  asthma and a causative role of the immune system in pathogenesis of bronchiolitis have been suggested.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES [31]]\\nContent: Some patients have symptoms suggesting histamine toxicity: vasodilatation, hypotension, vomiting, diarrhea, throbbing headache, coma and bronchoconstriction. In Latin America, victims of attacks by A. m.  scutellata have  shown  evidence  of  generalized  rhabdomyolysis (grossly elevated  serum creatine kinase, aminotransferases  and myoglobin), intravascular hemolysis, hypercatecholaminemia (hypertension,  pulmonary  edema  with  hyaline  membrane,  myocardial damage), bleeding, hepatic dysfunction and acute renal failure. Mass vespid attacks can result in hepatic damage. In non-sensitized people, stings from Solenopsis and Myrmecia spp. produce pain, itching, swelling and erythema around a central weal which last a few hours, and later  vesicles  or  pustules.  In  an  un-sensitized  patient,  an  estimated 10,000 Solenopsis invicta stings caused no systemic envenoming. Multiple  traumatic bites  by soldiers  of army, driver, safari ants or  siafu (genus Dorylus, Ecitoninae)  may  ulcerate  and  become  secondarily infected.\\n---\\n[PATIENT INFORMATION]\\nDisease: Human African Trypanosomiasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is first-stage East African Trypanosomiasis caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. This was definitively confirmed by the microscopic demonstration of 5 to 10 trypanosomes per high power field on a thick blood film. The diagnosis is supported by the epidemiological link to a national game park in Malawi with tsetse fly exposure, and the clinical signs of fever, rash, and a trypanosomal chancre. The normal CSF confirmed the disease was in the first stage, without neurological involvement.\\nVitals: On presentation, his vital signs were: temperature 38 °C, pulse rate 130 bpm, and systolic blood pressure 60 mmHg. He later developed a sustained fever of 38 to 39 °C during his hospital stay.\\nContent: A 42-year-old British male expatriate who has lived in Malawi for 18 months. He has a family history of allergy. He had previously kept bees in the United Kingdom and been stung frequently without ill effect. However, 9 months prior to this presentation, he was bitten by insects at Lake Malawi and developed a self-resolving asthmatic attack over two days.\\n---\\n[INHALATIONAL ANTHRAX]\\nContent: Inhalational anthrax accounts for < 5% of reported cases. Nonspecific symptoms of mild fever, malaise, fatigue, and myalgia develop 1-5 days after exposure; nonproductive cough is often reported. In cases occurring in the 2001 epidemic, nausea or vomiting was common [6] and some had extreme fatigue and severe headache. Patients may have transient  improvement  after  several  days  or  may  directly  develop severe respiratory distress with cyanosis, diaphoresis, increased fever, and  tachycardia.  Stridor,  diffuse  rales,  and  basilar  dullness  may  be heard. Chest radiographs reveal symmetric, characteristic mediastinal widening, pleural effusions and, in some cases, patchy infiltrates (Fig. 60.3).  Massive,  superficial edema of the head and neck may occur. Meningitis, often hemorrhagic, occurs in ~50% of cases. Pleural effusions may also be hemorrhagic.

This is a clinical diagnosis based on the rapid progression of a destructive facial lesion in a chronically malnourished, unimmunized child from a resource-poor setting with a recent history suggestive of measles. The diagnosis is supported by the exclusion of other conditions like syphilis, yaws, or rapidly progressing leishmaniasis based on epidemiology and clinical presentation. There are no specific laboratory tests to confirm noma.\\nContent: Three days ago, the family noticed a dark sore on the child's cheek. The lesion progressed quickly to eat through the child's cheek. Associated symptoms include bad breath, poor oral intake, and listlessness.\\n---\\n[DEEP FASCIAL SPACE INFECTIONS]\\nContent: The deep fascial  spaces of  the head and neck are  potential cavities and can be involved in infections that extend from adjacent structures such  as  the  teeth,  tonsils,  lymph  nodes,  salivary  glands  and  soft tissues. Involvement and abscess formation and edema can result in obstruction  (swallowing  and  breathing),  pain,  tenderness,  trismus and neck stiffness. Visible soft tissue swelling can result from infections  of  the  peritonsillar,  parapharyngeal,  parotid,  submandibular, suprahyoid, periauricular and masseteric spaces. Peritonsillar abscess formation, also known as Quinsy, presents with unilateral swelling of  the  soft  palate  above  the  tonsil.  Abscess  formation  beneath  the floor of the mouth, called Ludwig's angina, produces tense and tender swelling behind the chin and between the angles of the jaw. Vincent's angina, or trench mouth, presents with localized or multiple necrotic mucosal  ulcerations  and  foul  breath.  Retropharyngeal  and  retroesophageal abscesses produce dysphagia and neck rigidity. Mediastinal spread is a potential complication that can lead to sepsis; rupture may lead to respiratory obstruction.  Erosion of the  great vessels of the neck can lead to catastrophic hemorrhage. Soft tissue lateral views of  the  head  and  neck  may  aid  in  diagnosing  retropharyngeal  and retroesophageal abscesses. Purulent material that is drained or aspirated from deep neck abscesses should be submitted for culture and sensitivity studies and the results used to adjust the selection of antibiotics. Treatment  should include aggressive antibiotic therapy against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms (including anaerobes), prompt incision and drainage of abscesses, and adequate nutrition and fluid therapy. Respiratory obstruction should be proactively addressed with consideration of artificial airways.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Group A Streptococcus pharyngitis may be mild or associated with high fever,  tender  anterior  cervical  lymphadenopathy,  tonsillar  exudates and raised peripheral white cell count. Symptoms usually resolve after 3-5  days,  although  suppurative  complications  (which  are  now uncommon in industrialized settings) include peritonsillar and retropharyngeal  abscess,  suppurative  lymphadenitis,  otitis  media,  mastoiditis and  meningitis. Non-suppurative  complications  include scarlet fever, acute rheumatic fever or acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Scarlet fever is characterized by a diffuse blanching rash that spreads from the chest to the abdomen and extremities leaving a  sandpaper-like  texture  to  the  skin.  Desquamation  of  the  fingers, toes, groin and axilla occurs one or more weeks later. The tongue is frequently coated in a white film (white strawberry tongue) that eventually gives way to a beefy red appearance (red strawberry tongue). While most cases are benign, scarlet fever was often lethal in the preantibiotic era. Many cases likely represented what would be regarded today as streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS).\\nIn simple impetigo, infection is confined to the epidermis with the formation of superficial crusted lesions on the face or other exposed body  parts.  In  tropical  and  impoverished  settings  'pyodermatous' lesions may be pustular and ulcerative. Children are usually afebrile and otherwise well, although resolution of pyoderma may take many days and result in scarring. Erysipelas, which typically affects the face or  an  extremity,  is  a  painful  infection  of  the  dermis  resulting  in  a clearly  demarcated  red  and  raised  area  of  inflammation  and  often formation of superficial bullae. Cellulitis involves the deeper subcutaneous tissues  causing  a  more  diffuse  and  less  clearly  demarcated area of inflammation. Infection of the draining lymphatic tracts (lymphangitis) results in tender linear streaks extending from the site of infection. Unlike impetigo, cellulitis and erysipelas are usually associated with fever and systemic toxicity.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Tuberculous Lymphadenitis with Paradoxical IRIS\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was tuberculous lymphadenitis with superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis, complicated by paradoxical immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). The initial diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis was confirmed by an AFB-positive fine-needle aspirate from a neck gland. The paradoxical IRIS was diagnosed clinically based on his worsening condition after starting ART, despite evidence of a good virologic and immunologic response. The superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis, likely with Staphylococcus aureus, was confirmed by the second aspirate showing purulent material with coccoid bacteria and the patient's rapid improvement following incision, drainage, and antibiotics.\\nVitals: On presentation, he was febrile with a temperature of 39.2 °C (102.56° F). His pulse was 112 bpm, respiratory rate was 28 breaths per minute, and he had a normal blood pressure.\\nContent: For six weeks, the patient has experienced a productive cough and chest pain, associated with systemic symptoms including weight loss, fevers, and night sweats.

Management strategies exploit all four principal mechanisms of heat loss and cold therapy targeted to specific body locations (see Fig. 24.1). Minor heat illnesses  are  self-limiting  if  the  patient  is  provided  with  fluids,  rest and access to a cool environment. The majority of cases require only fluids  and  electrolytes  for  resolution  of  symptoms.  Heat  edema  is prevented by exercise programs prior to travel to the tropics, optimization of diuretics and beta-blockers, and use of supportive compressive stockings.\\nHeat exhaustion is a more serious form of hyperthermia that requires close evaluation. Initial treatment of patients includes documentation of core temperature, assessment of blood chemistries, and treatment using  hydration,  moisture  to  the  skin-preferably  with  convective cooling and oral electrolyte solutions. If symptoms are more severe or mental status changes are noted, the patient should be treated with intravenous normal saline. Both normal and abnormal serum chemistries  should  be  rechecked  after  hydration  and  urine  output  is restored. Patients should be monitored until core body temperature has  normalized.  Heat  exhaustion  patients  who  have  persistent  or worsening  mental  status  changes  should  have  core  temperature rechecked to confirm the diagnosis, and should receive more aggressive and prolonged cold treatment.\\nThe  treatment  for  heat  stroke  requires  prompt,  aggressive  physical cooling.  All  measures  for  dissipating  heat  should  be  maximized: evaporation,  radiation,  convection  and  conductive  cooling.  Treatment of heat stroke in the tropics may be limited by inadequate water for  cooling  baths,  unavailability  of  air-conditioning  and  unreliable electricity to power fans. Patient monitoring during treatment may be\\nFIGURE 24.1 Thermoregulation and therapeutic cooling.\\ncomplicated by lack of quality thermometers or supportive laboratory tests.  One  frequently  overlooked  issue  is  that  the  conditions  that caused one heat casualty are very likely to cause a large number of casualties. Initial assessment of a solitary heat illness casualty should therefore consider how local medical resources may efficiently scale to treat a large number of patients.\\n---\\n[EPIDEMIOLOGY]\\nContent: Heat  illness  is  common  among  athletes,  soldiers,  foundry  workers and in the general population during mass gatherings in hot environments such as the annual Hajj pilgrimage [2, 3]. Among young athletes, the most severe form of heat illness - heat stroke - is the second leading  cause  of  death  [4].  In  tropical  regions,  heat  casualties  are common and may be increasing in developing economies as more workers are required to work under sweltering conditions. In many settings, inadequate access to cool havens or to cold, potable water increase the risk of heat illness. Epidemiologic studies on heat illness conducted in the USA and Europe [5, 6]indicate the groups at highest risk of heat illness are children under four years of age, the elderly, those with renal and endocrine disorders, and institutionalized and hospitalized patients [7, 8]. In particular, the  importance of sweatbased evaporative cooling is demonstrated by the higher incidence of heat  illness  in  the  elderly  and  in  patients  being  treated  with  anticholinergic medication [9, 10]. At this time, there are no convincing studies  demonstrating  differences  in  risk  of  heat  illness  between genders. Acclimatization to heat can reduce the risk of heat illness. Acclimatization involves near- and long-term physiologic adaptation; key  findings  include:  rapid  correction  of  water  loss  and  improved sodium preservation and gradual normalization of plasma electrolytes, altered blood perfusion to the skin, and reduced sodium concentrations in sweat and urine. New arrivals to tropical climes undergo limited acclimatization over a 2-4-week period; subsequent advances in acclimatization are both limited and not definitively proven by the current literature.\\n---\\n[MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOMES]\\nContent: body  core  temperature  at  twice  the  rate  of  convective  mist-water cooling  (mist  water  and  electric  fan).  The  advantage  of  cold  water baths is  that  the rate of cooling can be controlled by changing the water temperature or the amount of body surface area in the water. In immersion cooling, the patient is undressed and placed in a tub of suitable depth to allow water to cover the extremities; cold immersion should only be used on alert patients. Heat stroke patients and those with comorbidities, such as underlying cardiac disease, should be monitored for arrhythmias or syncope and, if the situation is not critical, cooled using less aggressive methods. In developed regions, immersion cooling has fallen out of favor because of difficulties with patient telemetry.  In  refugee camps, however,  a  water bath is often constantly in use to treat heat illnesses.\\n---\\n[DIAGNOSIS]\\nContent: The  differential  diagnosis  of  heat  illness  requires  a  history  of  heat exposure,  a  detailed  physical  exam  and  bedside  studies.  Infectious etiologies and rare causes of hyperthermia need to be ruled out. The differential diagnosis should include malignant hyperthermia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, endocrine and hypothalamic disorders, and fictitious hyperthermia. Heat edema and heat syncope are suggested by advanced patient age, deconditioning, low cardiac reserve and recent arrival in the tropics from cooler regions. Miliaria, a distinct heat dermatosis, is differentiated from other tropical skin maladies  by  the  timing,  distribution  and  physical  appearance  of  skin vesicles.  Miliaria  responds  promptly  to  antihistamines  or  dilute topical chlorhexidine. Heat cramps are a second common malady in unacclimatized individuals;  diagnosis  is  suggested  by  resolution  of cramps with rest and cool treatment, stretching and fluids, and electrolyte  repletion.  The  two  most  dangerous  heat  illnesses  -  heat exhaustion and heat stroke - have overlapping clinical features and are discussed in greater detail below.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

       "    'content': \"PATIENT QUESTION:\\nI’ve had these dry, red, itchy patches on my buttocks and lower back for almost five years now. My doctor keeps saying it’s just eczema or psoriasis, but the steroid creams never really make it go away. Recently, some of the flat red spots have started to feel thicker and raised, almost like hard plaques. I’m a 55-year-old man. Could this be something other than just dry skin?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[ERYTHRODERMA]\\nContent: Pityriasis rubra pilaris, a close relative of psoriasis, may also be the cause of erythroderma. Patients often have conspicuous 'islands of sparing', where seemingly normal skin is noted among erythrodermic skin. Hyperlinearity may be seen in palms and soles, in addition to a salmon-colored, sand-papered type of scale with sharp demarcation along transgrediens lines (the line boundary between cutaneous skin and the sole of the foot, for instance).\\nOther important diagnoses to consider include atopic dermatitis, viral exanthems, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, which in the leukemic phase is termed Sé zary syndrome, the staphylococcal skin scalded syndrome, as well as toxic shock syndrome. In HIV-positive individuals or those with other immunosuppressing disorders, seborrheic dermatitis may lead to erythroderma. Uncommonly, systemic malignancies such as colon and lung carcinoma, as well as lymphoma and leukemia, can also be culprits. In those who have had a bone marrow transplant, erythroderma may be a result of graft-versus-host disease. Red man syndrome indicates a state of erythroderma where no clear culprit can be ascertained.\\n---\\n[SKIN DISEASE]\\nContent: CPOD consists  of  flat-topped  papules  that  vary  in  size  and  height above the skin surface (Fig. 1 12.6B). Some lesions can  be macular. Itching can occur, and individuals with CPOD may also have acute lesions. LOD or 'sowda' typically affects young adults and is characterized by pruritic, hyperpigmented and hyperkeratotic plaques (Fig. 112.6C). The distribution is asymmetric, involving one limb, and is associated with regional lymphadenopathy. In later stages, the skin can be grossly lichenified. Itching is intense in the acute stage; this condition can coexist with APOD or CPOD. Atrophy of the skin is relatively common in areas of high endemicity (Fig. 1 12.6D). Atrophic skin adopts many of the characteristics of aging, such as loss of elasticity, and the skin appears excessively wrinkled. Hairs may be lost and sweating reduced. Onchocercal depigmentation or 'leopard skin' is associated with patches of complete pigment loss and generally affects the lower leg anteriorly (Fig. 1 12.6E). A rare manifestation is 'hanging groin'  or  'adenolymphocele'  that  is  observed  only  in  heavy  and longstanding infections, and consists of a pouch of lymphedematous tissue in which hang atrophic inguinal or femoral nodes (Fig. 1 12.6F). Inflammatory damage to the lymph nodes and lymphatics may, over the long term, lead to elephantiasis of the limbs or genitalia.\\n---\\n[ERYTHRODERMA]\\nContent: Correctly  diagnosing  the  cause  of  diffuse  erythroderma  or  wholebody erythema presents a unique challenge to the physician. These patients may present with marked systemic symptoms, and can suffer severe morbidity from lack of epidermal barrier function, including dehydration,  infection  and  severe  pain.  Ectropion  may  be  seen. Diffuse erythema can lead to severe imbalances of electrolytes and minerals,  and  hypocalcemic  tetany  can  occur.  As  the  eruption improves,  generalized  exfoliation  is  the  norm.  The  evaluation  of patients with erythroderma often requires histopathologic evaluation, to exclude full-thickness epidermal necrosis, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). TEN is commonly caused by a drug, but infectious etiologies have also been implicated, particularly mycoplasma and herpetic infections.\\nErythroderma may be caused by severe drug reactions. The presence of small, superficial pustules may indicate exanthematous generalized pustular dermatosis (AGEP), most commonly caused by β -lactam and cephalosporin antibiotics. Patients  present with fever and can have peripheral blood leukocytosis, commonly prompting evaluation for an  infectious  disease.  A  similar  finding  may  be  noted  in  pustular psoriasis, which may occur in patients with no prior history of psoriasis. Though nail findings may be helpful in those with prior history, such findings may not be seen in those with an acute, first episode. Patients appear ill and are often hospitalized. Cultures of the pustules\\nFIGURE 8.6 Ichthyosis. Note the Cne white scales in the lower extremities.\\nfail to indicate a superficial cutaneous infection, though ectopic infection  such  as  streptococcal  pharyngitis  may  precipitate  an  attack. Though  oral  steroids  may  improve  symptoms,  upon  withdrawal, disease can re-flare.\\n---\\n[DERMATOLOGIC DISEASE]\\nContent: Scabies can present with pruritic papular lesions similar to those seen with PPE; however, scabies lesions tend to be clustered in the finger webs, waist, ankles, axillae, breasts, and genital areas, and burrows can sometimes be seen. Severe scabies ('Norwegian' scabies) can present with a crusted thick grayish scale teeming with mites. Scratching of scabies lesions can lead to bacterial superinfection. Oral ivermectin or  topical  agents  are  effective.  Prurigo  nodularis-a  condition  that results from intense scratching-presents with larger ( > 1 cm) pruritic nodules that often start on the extremities with a symmetric distribution; management should identify the underlying cause of pruritis. Topical steroids, topical capsaicin, and oral antihistamines can ameliorate symptoms.\\nSeborrheic dermatitis presents with dandruff and indistinct plaques of  yellowish  scale  involving  the  scalp,  face,  chest,  back,  and  groin. Although it can typically be seen on the hair-bearing area of the head (e.g. eyebrows, outer ear canal), in the context of HIV infection, and especially in Africa, it occurs at skin folds (e.g. axillae, inner thighs). Mild  cases  respond  to  dandruff  shampoo  (e.g.  selenium sulfide or zinc pyrithione).  More severe cases require  topical  antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole) directed against Pityrosporum yeasts such as Malassezia furfur and steroids. Refractory cases may require oral ketoconazole.\\nPhotodermatitis  frequently  occurs  in  Africa  and  presents  with  an itchy, scaly rash. It is differentiated from seborrheic dermatitis by its distribution  on  sun-exposed  areas  of  skin.  Although  sulfonamides can be photosensitizing, their use in treating HIV infection is important  and  they  should  not  be  stopped,  if  possible,  because  of photodermatitis.\\n---\\n[PRURITUS AND PAPULES]\\nContent: cream, sulfur, malathion and ivermectin lotion. Crusted or nodular scabies and disease in the immunosuppressed often require systemic ivermectin at 200 mcg/kg. The entire family, including pets, should be treated, and clothes, bedding, and frequently used fomites should be immediately  washed  in  warm  water.  A  second  treatment  a  week  after  is usually recommended. Oral antipruritics may be needed.\\nPrurigo nodularis manifests as hyperkeratotic nodules, linear excoriations and lichenification, particularly over areas that the patient can reach.  In  this  condition,  patients  may  experience  diffuse  or  focal pruritus.  Rather  than  scratching,  patients  tend  to  'pick',  creating 'picker  nodules' .  Therapy  is  with  topical  or  injectable  steroids  or phototherapy. Nodules may also raise concern for scabies, particularly in  the  patient  with  severe  pruritus.  It  is  important  to  consider  the diagnosis  of  papular  eruption  of  HIV,  where  patients  develop  erythematous papules with urticarial-type erythema. Chronic cases may resemble  prurigo  nodularis.  Recent  reports  have  shown  that  the\\nFIGURE 8.4 Scabies. Scabies incognito in which an elderly patient with a neuropathy had a nonspeciCc, asymptomatic hand 'rash' that proved to be due to crusted scabies.\\npathology  of  these  lesions  may  mimic  insect  bites.  Interestingly, symptoms as well as response to therapy may correspond with the CD4 count in HIV-infected individuals. Finally, when these papules show a necrotic center, the patient is less pruritic, and the diagnosis of  papulonecrotic  tuberculosis  needs  to  be  considered.  Acne-like nodules and papules in a sun-exposed distribution should raise suspicion  for  eosinophilic  folliculitis  which  may  manifest  during  the immune reconstitution syndrome, but may also suggest viral resistance, worsening CD4 counts, or untreated infection altogether.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

I also noticed I'm \\nhaving constipation sometimes and then diarrhea the next day. Is this something serious or just a normal infection?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[MILD ILLNESS]\\nContent: Enteric fever is usually insidious. Fever may gradually increase over the first week of illness. Headache, anorexia, malaise, and other nonspecific,  flu-like  symptoms  are  common  and  may  precede  fever. Abdominal complaints  including  diarrhea,  constipation,  and  nonlocalizing abdominal pain each occur in less than a third of cases, but may raise clinical suspicion [16].\\nPhysical findings are also nonspecific. Relative bradycardia, or pulsetemperature dissociation, is considered a classic sign of enteric fever, but there is no widely accepted definition of relative bradycardia and little evidence that it is a useful predictor [17]. Rose spots are small, blanching pink macular lesions, typically 2-4 mm, that usually occur on the chest, abdomen and/or back during the second week of illness, but are infrequently observed. A white, yellow or brown coating of the tongue that spares the tongue's edges is common. Mild abdominal tenderness may be present. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, if present, are usually modest.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Intestinal capillariasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is intestinal capillariasis caused by the nematode Capillaria philippinensis. The diagnosis was established based on the patient's clinical presentation of severe chronic diarrhoea, profound malabsorption with weight loss and oedema, and electrolyte abnormalities. Definitive confirmation was made by the identification of characteristic peanut-shaped ova on stool microscopy. The patient's residence in an endemic region and her positive clinical response to albendazole therapy further substantiated the diagnosis.\\nVitals: On presentation, the patient was afebrile, with a heart rate of 100 bpm and blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg.\\nContent: Symptoms began two months prior with stomach rumbles and colicky abdominal pain, which later progressed to anorexia and vomiting. The patient developed voluminous diarrhoea, occurring five to ten times in 24 hours, both during the day and at night, and unrelated to meals. She had been treated with various antibiotics, including metronidazole, and antidiarrhoeal drugs without any improvement. Over the last month, she developed lower limb swelling and severe prostration.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Marburg virus disease\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is Marburg virus disease (MVD), a viral haemorrhagic fever. The diagnosis was strongly suspected based on the clinical presentation of a severe febrile illness with shock and conjunctivitis, and the epidemiological link to her husband who died of a similar illness after working in a mine. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by a positive Marburg virus PCR result. A co-infection with Plasmodium falciparum was also diagnosed but was considered less likely to be the cause of her severe presentation given the low parasitaemia and high local prevalence.\\nVitals: On presentation, her blood pressure was 85/65 mmHg, pulse rate was 105 bpm, and temperature was 38 °C (100.4 °F).\\nContent: The illness began 5 days prior with fever, a sore throat, and generalized aching. She subsequently developed abdominal pain and diarrhoea. Her condition has progressively worsened, leading to severe weakness to the point that she requires assistance to stand.\\n---\\n[ABDOMINAL PAIN]\\nContent: Enteric fever, amebic liver abscess, viral hepatitis, and, rarely, leaking or secondarily infected hydatid cysts may all cause fever and abdominal pain.\\n---\\n[SEVERE DEHYDRATION ( ≥ 10% VOLUME LOSS)]\\nContent: - Decreased consciousness\\n- Hypotension\\n- Deep respirations with an increase in respiratory rate\\n- Cool extremities\\n- Peripheral cyanosis\\nelicited  concern the  assessment of hydration (Box 3.2); the patient should be weighed at first presentation, as weight gain or loss can be a valuable guide to the effectiveness of rehydration.\\nThe rapid onset of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea after food consumption is most often due to the ingestion of a preformed toxin produced by Staphylococcus aureus , Bacillus cereus or Clostridium perfringens .\\nLarge-volume watery diarrhea indicates a small bowel etiology, e.g. due  to V.  cholerae ,  enterotoxigenic E.  coli and  rotavirus  infections. Toxin-induced  secretory  diarrhea  continues  independent  of  food intake. Malabsorption of carbohydrate in the small intestine leads to fermentation of unabsorbed substrates by colonic bacteria; this may cause bloating, the passage of much rectal gas and frothy stools, which are all characteristic of giardiasis. Cryptosporidiosis can involve both small and large bowel, causing short-lived and self-limiting diarrhea; however, the infection can be prolonged in patients with impaired immune responses. Cyclospora cayetanensis can also cause  acute and more chronic diarrhea with abnormalities of intestinal absorption.\\nFrequent  bowel  movements  with  small  volumes  of  stool  and  the passage  of  blood  and  mucus  suggest  colonic  infection.  Causes  of bloody diarrhea (dysentery) include invasive bacteria such as Campylobacter spp., enterohemorrhagic E. coli , and Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia spp.; nonbacterial causes include Entamoeba histolytica (amebic dysentery) and Balantidium coli , which is spread by close contact with pigs. Colicky abdominal pain is common in many gut infections and is especially severe in campylobacteriosis and yersiniosis, mimicking acute appendicitis. Fever, chills and generalized myalgia are usually associated with infection by invasive organisms; these patients appear ill and have generalized abdominal tenderness.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

Some people also get a rash, loss of appetite, or a swollen belly as the illness progresses. Typhoid is caused by the \\nbacteria Salmonella enterica serotype typhi, which spreads through contaminated water, ice, uncooked foods like raw fruits without a peel, and \\nfood handled by someone who didn’t wash their hands after using the bathroom.

While  for  many  the  underlying  cause  is  a  self-limiting  globally endemic infection, such as gastroenteritis, physicians are increasingly encountering conditions not normally seen in the patient's country of origin. In some cases these are potentially life-threatening, such as malaria, and others have potential public health consequences, such as enteric fever.\\nTo evaluate returned travelers presenting with fever, an understanding of the geographic distribution of infections, risk factors for acquisition, incubation periods and clinical presentations is required. With this understanding, a risk assessment can be undertaken, initial investigations  instigated,  and,  when  appropriate,  presumptive  therapy started.\\n---\\n[FEBRILE ILLNESSES]\\nContent: Priority  should  be  given  to  identifying  illnesses  that  can  be  fatal rapidly or pose a threat to public health. Delayed diagnosis of Plasmodium  falciparum malaria  can  be  lethal,  and  undiagnosed  TB  or measles can lead to secondary cases.\\nFever  soon  after  immigration  from  malarial  countries  could  be malaria; 90% of P. falciparum cases occur within 1 month of arrival. Fever with rash suggests dengue, while fever with rash and arthritis may  indicate  chikungunya  virus.  Early  fevers  may  also  be  due  to typhoid  and  paratyphoid  fevers,  rickettsial  infections,  and  amebic liver abscesses. Fever months after migration may be caused by TB, primary malarial infection, or relapse of P. vivax and P.  ovale. Many less  common infections can be associated with fever, though other accompanying  signs  and  symptoms  may  suggest  these  diagnoses. Other febrile illness with short incubation periods, such as influenza or meningococcemia, can occur in immigrants exposed after migration, but may be more relevant to returning travelers [8]. This chapter will focus on infectious diseases that can be seen by clinicians at any time following migration and that are likely to be related to the individual's country of origin or migration process.\\n---\\n[KEY FEATURES]\\nContent: - Travel, especially to developing countries, is associated with an increased risk of infections not usually seen in highincome countries, e.g. malaria, enteric fever, dengue, and schistosomiasis\\n- While gastroenteritis, respiratory tract infections, and self-limiting viral infections are common, an important minority of patients will have a potentially life-threatening tropical infection\\n- The evaluation of an ill returned traveler therefore requires a detailed travel history together with an understanding of the geographic distribution of infections, risk factors for acquisition, incubation periods, clinical presentations and appropriate laboratory investigations\\n- A syndromic approach to speci c investigations, and to presumptive therapy pending laboratory con rmation of the diagnosis, is appropriate\\n- As a rule, malaria should be excluded in all travelers presenting with a fever who have visited the tropics\\n---\\n[MALARIA]\\nContent: Malaria may become symptomatic after the initial post-travel period, and so all returned travelers from malaria-endemic areas should be educated  about  nonspecific  symptoms  and  signs,  especially  fever, during the first few months after return. They should be advised to seek  an  early  medical  opinion  and  inform  health  professionals  of their travel history, should these symptoms occur.\\n---\\n[MALARIA [7]]\\nContent: Malaria is an important, potentially fatal infection in travelers returning from the tropics, particularly from sub-Saharan Africa. It should be  excluded  in  all  returned  travelers  with  a  history  of  fever.  Most short-term  travelers  present  within  1  month  of  return,  however P. falciparum occasionally presents up to 6 months later and P. vivax , P. ovale and P. malariae can present a year or more following return [8]. Many travelers do not take chemoprophylaxis, or take it inadequately [6]. When malaria is acquired despite chemoprophylaxis, the onset of symptoms is often delayed, severity of illness reduced, and microbiologic diagnosis may be obscured [9]. Because chemoprophylaxis  may  obscure the diagnosis, in cases where malaria is  thought likely, chemoprophylaxis should be stopped while patients are investigated [7].\\nNearly all patients with malaria give a history of fever; however, up to  half  are  afebrile  on  presentation  and  specific  fever  patterns  are uncommon [10]. Headache, myalgia, arthralgia, and malaise are frequently described, with some patients reporting diarrhea or cough. Complications occur mainly with P. falciparum infection. In patients with confusion, seizures or reduced conscious level, cerebral malaria or hypoglycemia should be considered; hypoxia, tachypnea, and signs of pulmonary edema indicate respiratory involvement.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

Fever may gradually increase over the first week of illness. Headache, anorexia, malaise, and other nonspecific,  flu-like  symptoms  are  common  and  may  precede  fever. Abdominal complaints  including  diarrhea,  constipation,  and  nonlocalizing abdominal pain each occur in less than a third of cases, but may raise clinical suspicion [16].\\nPhysical findings are also nonspecific. Relative bradycardia, or pulsetemperature dissociation, is considered a classic sign of enteric fever, but there is no widely accepted definition of relative bradycardia and little evidence that it is a useful predictor [17]. Rose spots are small, blanching pink macular lesions, typically 2-4 mm, that usually occur on the chest, abdomen and/or back during the second week of illness, but are infrequently observed. A white, yellow or brown coating of the tongue that spares the tongue's edges is common. Mild abdominal tenderness may be present. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, if present, are usually modest.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Following an incubation period of 7-18 days, Lassa fever insidiously begins with fever, weakness and malaise. More than 50% of patients experience joint and lumbar pain, and 60% or more have a nonproductive  cough.  Most  patients  also  have  severe  headache,  usually frontal, and a painful sore throat. Many also develop severe retrosternal chest pain and about half have vomiting or diarrhea and abdominal pain. On physical examination, respiratory rate, temperature and pulse rate are elevated and blood pressure may be low. About a third have conjunctivitis and more than two thirds have pharyngitis, half of whom have exudates with diffusely inflamed and swollen posterior pharynx and tonsils but with few, if any, petechiae [1-4].\\nUp to a third of hospitalized patients progress to a prostrating illness 6-8 days after onset of fever. They are often dehydrated on admission, with elevated hematocrit. Bleeding occurs in only 15-20% of patients, limited primarily to the mucosal surfaces or, occasionally, conjunctival hemorrhages or gastrointestinal or vaginal bleeding. Edema of the face and neck occurs in severe disease and carries a poor prognosisthis may indicate capillary leakage, rather than cardiac dysfunction or impaired  venous  return.  Approximately  half  of  all  patients  have diffuse abdominal tenderness, but there are no localizing signs and bowel sounds are usually active. On more than one occasion, surgery\\nhas been performed which is contraindicated. Proteinuria occurs in two thirds of patients and blood urea nitrogen levels may be moderately elevated [1-4].\\n---\\n[INTRODUCTION]\\nContent: Up to 70% of travelers to developing countries report health problems,  the  majority  of  which  are  self-limiting;  however  8-15%  of travelers are ill enough to seek medical attention while abroad or on return home, with fever as a common presenting complaint [1-4].

During the next few days,  these  symptoms continue and may be  accompanied  by anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, photophobia and cough. The fever is typically high (39-41°C) and associated with a severe  frontal  headache.  Rash,  considered  the  hallmark  feature  of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, appears on day three of fever as small, pink,  blanching  macules  (typically  on  the  wrists,  ankles  and  forearms) that evolve maculopapules. Within 24 hours, it spreads centrally to involve the legs, buttocks, arms, axillae, trunk, neck and face. The entire body may be involved, including the mucous membranes of the palate and pharynx [1 1]. Characteristic of the rash are petechial lesions,  in  a  distribution  that  includes  the  palms  and  soles,  which occur in 36% to 82% of patients. In some severe cases, petechiae may coalesce to form large ecchymoses. No eschar at the inoculation site is visible. Severe manifestations may include pulmonary edema and hemorrhage, cerebral edema, myocarditis, renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and gangrene. Three factors are independent predictors of failure by the physician to initiate therapy the first time a patient is seen: absence of a rash, presentation between August 1 and April 30, and presentation within the first three days of illness. In untreated patients who survive their illness, the natural course of fever terminates after two to three weeks.\\n---\\n[PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS]\\nContent: A detailed history is helpful, especially with regard to geographical location,  season  and  mosquito  exposure.  Rapid  onset  of  arthritic symptoms is usual, with pain on movement, tenderness and slight swelling (that can be hard to detect) the most common signs. Tenderness, swelling, heat, redness and intolerance to movement or pressure can be extreme. Rash usually occurs within a few days after the onset of symptoms and resolves within 5-10 days, but can persist or recur. Rash distribution varies considerably, with the trunk and limbs most affected. The face is less affected and, rarely, the rash may be confined to palms, soles and/or digital webs. Lymphadenopathy is frequently present,  if  sought.  Aside  from  fatigue,  constitutional  symptoms usually resolve within a week [1, 8].\\nDiagnosis  is  usually  made  by  a  primary-care  physician  aided  by  a commercial serodiagnostic ELISA-based test (widely available in Australia).  Paired  serologic  testing  at  least  10-14  days  apart  is  recommended.  Peripheral  blood  counts  are  usually  normal  except  for  a possible slight  neutrophilia.  An  elevated  erythrocyte  sedimentation rate  can occur,  but decreases within a few weeks.  Serum C  reactive protein levels are rarely elevated. Erosive changes in x-rays are generally not seen [8].\\nThe  differential  diagnoses  at  initial  disease  presentation  include related  Old  World  alphaviruses  (e.g.  chikungunya,  Barmah  Forest or  Sindbis  virus.  [6]),  dengue  and  Epstein-Barr  virus.  Other  viral arthritides may  also be considered, for example rubella or parvovirus B19 [5, 8]. Drug reactions, autoimmune  arthritides (e.g. rheumatoid  arthritis  and  systemic  lupus  erythematosis)  and  other infectious arthritides may also be among the differential diagnoses. Persistent distinct monoarticular arthritis is not consistent with RRV disease [8].\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Most patients with VEE have a history of exposure to mosquitoes in regions  of  humid  tropical  forests  or  have  been  present  during  an equine epizootic  [2]. Following  an  incubation  period  of  1-5  days, chills, headache, fever, body aches and prostration begin abruptly [3]. Asthenia,  dizziness  and  acute  discomfort  are  incapacitating.  Lumbosacral pain is common, along with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and a sore throat. After defervescence, a dull headache and weakness may persist for several days; fever and symptoms occasionally recrudesce. Although signs of mild neurologic involvement are common, only about 4% of infected children progress to frank neurologic disease; adults rarely do. Signs include nuchal rigidity, stupor, coma, delirium, seizures, cranial nerve palsies, motor weakness, paralysis, nystagmus, pathologic reflexes and spastic paralysis. Elevated intracranial pressure and  meningismus  occur  in  most  childhood  cases.  Approximately 0.5% of all symptomatic cases are fatal, nearly all in children. However, many survivors of neurologic disease experience sequelae, including memory problems, nervousness, asthenia, recurrent seizures, motor impairment, psychomotor retardation and behavioral disorders.\\nEastern  equine  encephalitis  typically  begins  after  3-10  days  of incubation with the sudden onset of headache, fever, chills, photophobia, dysethesias, myalgia, malaise and vomiting [1, 2, 4]. In infants, encephalitis caused by eastern equine encephalitis virus is characterized  by  abrupt  onset,  but  in  older  children  and  adults  is manifested after a few days of systemic illness. Patients may recover or  can  progress to more severe neurologic illness beginning with a worsening headache, dizziness, vomiting, lethargy and progressing to neck  stiffness,  confusion  and  convulsions.  Severe  cases  requiring hospitalization may involve seizures, disorientation and coma. The course of illness may be rapid in infants; infants are most likely to suffer neurologic sequelae,  such  as  motor  weakness, paralysis, aphasia, mental retardation and seizures. Many patients with permanent sequelae die a few years later.\\n---\\n[N O N I N FE CTI O U S  DI S E A S E S O F I M M I G RA N TS]\\nContent: Fatigue, bruising, and nonhealing sores can suggest blood disorders, including anemias and thalassemias, particularly among people from the Mediterranean, Africa, and Asia. Some of these blood disorders are genetic, whereas others are caused by nutritional disorders such as  iron,  B12 or  folate deficiency,  or chronic diseases  such as hookworm infestation, HIV, lead intoxication, kidney  disease,  or malignancy.  In the future, it is likely that  immigrants  will  bear  a disproportionate  burden  of disease  due to infection-associated cancers, such as hepatoma from chronic hepatitis B and C, carcinoma of  the  cervix  caused  by  human  papillomavirus,  Epstein-Barr  virusassociated Burkitt lymphoma, human herpesvirus-8-associated Kaposi sarcoma, and HIV-associated lymphomas.\\nMalnutrition and stunting of growth can be especially severe in immigrant children and refugees as a result of food deprivation and infections. Malabsorption can result from intestinal protozoan infections or,  rarely,  tropical  sprue;  lactose  intolerance  is  common  among African and certain Asian immigrant groups. Immigrants may present with  specific  nutritional  disorders  such  as  bowing  of  the  legs  in children or osteomalacia in adults with vitamin D deficiency, xerophthalmia secondary to vitamin A deficiency, endemic goiter associated with iodine deficiency, or acrodermatitis with zinc deficiency.\\nDepression  and  stress  are  common  among  immigrants  who  are adapting to a new culture and language. Post-traumatic stress disorder and other psychiatric problems are not uncommon among refugees, especially those who have experienced torture, rape, and other physical trauma in war-torn countries. Those who care for immigrants may find  that  disclosures  of  trauma  occur  only  after  development  of  a trusting  relationship  with  the  healthcare  provider.  There  are  many validated  screening  instruments  available,  including  the  Harvard Trauma Questionnaire to check for post-traumatic stress disorder, the Hopkins Symptom Checklist which screens for anxiety, and the Beck Depression Inventory [17].\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

This was confirmed by the detection of rabies viral RNA through RT-PCR in a saliva sample collected at admission. The diagnosis was strongly supported by the patient's history of a WHO category III stray dog bite in a rabies-endemic country, the rapidly progressive febrile quadriparesis, the development of autonomic instability, and the critical omission of rabies immunoglobulin during post-exposure prophylaxis. The clinical course and confirmatory laboratory test ruled out other neurological conditions considered in the differential.\\nVitals: On admission, his blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, pulse 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute, and temperature 38.5°C (101.3°F).\\nContent: A 20-year-old man presented with fever for 4 days, followed by tingling and weakness that began in his left leg and then rapidly progressed to involve all four limbs over the next 2 days.

This was confirmed by serological testing showing a positive Mayaro IgM-IFA (1280 on 29 August, 40 on 12 September) and IgG-IFA (2560 on both dates) with a confirmatory plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) that rose from 40 to 160. The diagnosis aligns with the patient's travel history to the Amazon Basin, the preceding dengue-like febrile illness, and the characteristic prolonged symmetrical polyarthralgias primarily affecting small peripheral joints, while other common travel-related viral and bacterial causes were ruled out by serology.\\nVitals: No specific vital signs were reported other than the occurrence of an acute febrile illness with chills.\\nContent: During the second week of a 3.5-week trip to the Amazon Basin of northern Peru, the patient developed an acute febrile illness with chills, malaise, frontal headache, generalized myalgia, and a transient, non-pruritic maculopapular rash. The rash began on the forearms about 1 week after fever onset, spread to the trunk, neck, and face, and faded after 3 days. Slowly progressive, debilitating polyarthralgias affecting peripheral joints, with transient joint swelling, also developed. Painful cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy lasted for about 1 week. Fever and other acute symptoms subsided within 1 week, but polyarthralgias persisted, showing a symmetrical pattern mainly affecting the small joints of the hands and feet, wrists, ankles, and knees. Upon return to Switzerland a few weeks later, the patient reported stiffness of the affected joints, mainly in the morning and after immobility, and the joint pains did not improve for two more months.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Amoebic liver abscess\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is an amoebic liver abscess, caused by Entamoeba histolytica. This is supported by the clinical triad of fever and tender hepatomegaly with right intercostal tenderness, imaging findings of a large solitary liver lesion with an elevated hemidiaphragm, and the aspiration of characteristic 'brownish pus'. The diagnosis was further confirmed by the patient's rapid clinical response to metronidazole therapy and the relevant epidemiological risk factor of consuming locally brewed alcohol known to be associated with amoebiasis.\\nVitals: On examination, the patient's temperature was 38.3 °C (100.8 °F), blood pressure was 100/80 mmHg, pulse was 102 bpm, and respiratory rate was 24 breath cycles per minute.\\nContent: For the past week, the patient experienced fever, chills, headache, and body aches, along with severe right-hypochondrial pain. The abdominal pain is described as constant, dull, radiating to the right shoulder, and exacerbated by coughing and resting on the right side. Over the last few days, he also developed a dry cough, has vomited twice, and has lost his appetite.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

Could this be serious?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[EPIDEMIOLOGY]\\nContent: South American hemorrhagic fever viruses cause chronic infections of rodents,  with  a  wide  regional  distribution.  Infected  rodents  move freely  in  their  natural  habitat  and  may  invade  human  dwellings. Humans are  infected  through  mucosal  exposure  to  aerosols  or  by direct  contact  of  abraded  skin  with  infectious  material.  Person-toperson transmission is very rare and may occur via direct contact with infected body fluids (e.g. sexual transmission) of a viremic patient; nosocomial infections have also been reported. Nevertheless, agricultural  workers  (mostly  male  adults)  have  historically  been  at  the highest risk for infection while working around potentially infected rodents in fields.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Visceral leishmaniasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar), caused by a Leishmania protozoan. This diagnosis is supported by the patient's presentation with chronic undulating fever, severe malnutrition, splenomegaly, generalized lymphadenopathy, and pancytopenia. Epidemiological risk was high, as she was from a known endemic area with a family history of the disease. Although an initial rK39 RDT was negative, the diagnosis was confirmed by a positive Direct Agglutination Test (DAT) with a high titre of 1:6400 and a definitive clinical response to treatment with liposomal amphotericin B.\\nVitals: On presentation, her vital signs were: temperature 39.6°C (103.3°F), pulse 96 bpm, and blood pressure 100/60 mmHg.\\nContent: For the past four weeks, the patient has experienced an undulating fever, occurring mainly in the afternoon, accompanied by chills and occasional convulsions. Initially, she was well between febrile episodes and played normally. However, over time she has developed progressive anorexia, a dry cough, chest pain, and joint and back pain.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Rabies\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was paralytic rabies, caused by the rabies lyssavirus. This was confirmed by the detection of rabies viral RNA through RT-PCR in a saliva sample collected at admission. The diagnosis was strongly supported by the patient's history of a WHO category III stray dog bite in a rabies-endemic country, the rapidly progressive febrile quadriparesis, the development of autonomic instability, and the critical omission of rabies immunoglobulin during post-exposure prophylaxis. The clinical course and confirmatory laboratory test ruled out other neurological conditions considered in the differential.\\nVitals: On admission, his blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, pulse 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute, and temperature 38.5°C (101.3°F).\\nContent: A 20-year-old man presented with fever for 4 days, followed by tingling and weakness that began in his left leg and then rapidly progressed to involve all four limbs over the next 2 days. The onset of symptoms occurred about one month after a stray dog bite. After admission, he developed autonomic instability, evidenced by increased perspiration and significant variability in heart rate and blood pressure. He also developed dysphagia and respiratory distress, requiring mechanical ventilation on the third day after hospitalization. The patient died due to sudden cardiac arrest on the fifth day of hospitalization, which was nine days post-onset of symptoms.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Tuberculous Lymphadenitis with Paradoxical IRIS\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was tuberculous lymphadenitis with superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis, complicated by paradoxical immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). The initial diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis was confirmed by an AFB-positive fine-needle aspirate from a neck gland. The paradoxical IRIS was diagnosed clinically based on his worsening condition after starting ART, despite evidence of a good virologic and immunologic response. The superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis, likely with Staphylococcus aureus, was confirmed by the second aspirate showing purulent material with coccoid bacteria and the patient's rapid improvement following incision, drainage, and antibiotics.\\nVitals: On presentation, he was febrile with a temperature of 39.2 °C (102.56° F). His pulse was 112 bpm, respiratory rate was 28 breaths per minute, and he had a normal blood pressure.\\nContent: For six weeks, the patient has experienced a productive cough and chest pain, associated with systemic symptoms including weight loss, fevers, and night sweats. During this period, he also developed a painful swelling in his neck. He has no other reported symptoms.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES [4]]\\nContent: Ticks  are  picked  up  in  the  countryside  or  from  domestic  animals, particularly dogs, in the home. The majority of patients and almost all fatal cases are children. After the tick has been attached for 5-6 days, a progressive ascending, lower motor neuron paralysis develops with paraesthesiae. Often, a child, who may have been irritable for the previous 24 h, falls on getting out of bed first thing in the morning and is found to be weak or ataxic. Paralysis increases over the next few  days:  death  results  from  bulbar  and  respiratory  paralysis  and aspiration  of  stomach  contents.  Vomiting  is  a  feature  of  the  more acute course of I. holocyclus envenoming.\\nThis  clinical  picture  is  often  misinterpreted  as  poliomyelitis.  Other neurologic conditions, including Guillain-Barré syndrome, paralytic rabies, Eaton-Lambert syndrome, myasthenia gravis or botulism, may also be suspected. Diagnosis depends on finding the tick, which is likely to be concealed in a crevice, orifice or hairy area of the body. The scalp is the commonest place. Fatal tick paralysis has been caused by a tick attached to the tympanic membrane.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

However, as the illness progresses, the differential would include other intestinal protozoa, including Giardia lamblia .  A  rare  cause  of  illness  in  travelers, Cystoisospora  belli ,  can  produce  a  prolonged  diarrhea  after  travel,  and  is sensitive to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Fatigue and weight loss can be caused by Entamoeba histolytica , but anorexia is not as prominent. Dientamoeba fragilis can cause prolonged, low-grade intestinal symptoms, but without anorexia or weight loss. Fatigue and weight loss can be due to tropical sprue, which is a rare cause of prolonged diarrhea  in  travelers.  Celiac  sprue  occasionally  manifests  during foreign travel.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Spinal cord schistosomiasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The patient was diagnosed with spinal cord schistosomiasis complicating an infection with Schistosoma haematobium. The diagnosis was established based on the clinical presentation of a conus syndrome, a clear exposure history of swimming in Lake Malawi, the prior identification of S. haematobium eggs in his urine, significant peripheral eosinophilia, and characteristic MRI findings of a lesion in the conus medullaris and bladder wall thickening. His complete recovery following treatment with praziquantel and corticosteroids further supports the diagnosis.\\nVitals: He has normal vital signs; specific values were not reported.\\nContent: For three weeks, the patient experienced progressive difficulty urinating, requiring increasing abdominal pressure and only being able to pass small amounts at a time, associated with lower abdominal discomfort, abnormal sensations in the groins and genitals, and some erectile dysfunction. He also reports that walking did not feel normal, though he could not specify the abnormality. He denies weakness, dysaesthesia, or loss of sensation in his legs, and has no backache. Over the past two months, he had an unintentional weight loss of 8kg and fatigue without fever or night sweats. One week prior to presentation, he noticed a single episode of reddish urine discoloration without painful micturition or fever, for which he was treated at a local clinic. There is no history of trauma.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Stevens-Johnson syndrome\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), a severe drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction. This clinical diagnosis is based on the patient's generalized maculopapular rash with extensive mucous membrane involvement (oral, conjunctival, genital), which appeared approximately four weeks after starting nevirapine and co-trimoxazole, both of which are highly implicated drugs. The diagnosis is further supported by the much higher incidence of SJS in HIV-positive individuals. Infectious causes like malaria were ruled out with negative testing.\\nVitals: Temperature is 37.7°C (99.9°F), blood pressure is 120/68 mmHg, pulse is 90 bpm, and respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute.\\nContent: The patient developed a productive cough with whitish sputum, followed one day later by a generalized skin rash that started on her trunk and spread to the extremities and mucosal membranes. Over the past two days, she also developed a sore throat and dysuria. The rash involves her lips, oral mucosa, conjunctivae, and genital mucosa, and has made talking and eating difficult and painful.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Bartonellosis (Oroya fever)\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is acute bartonellosis, also known as Oroya fever, caused by Bartonella bacilliformis. The diagnosis was definitively established by the thin blood film showing massive red blood cell infestation with cocco-bacillary structures characteristic of the organism. This was supported by the clinical presentation of severe haemolytic anaemia, fever, and neurologic impairment, along with a compatible exposure history in an endemic region of Peru. Malaria was ruled out by negative blood smears.\\nVitals: On admission, his blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg, pulse was 110 bpm and regular, temperature was 39.2 °C (102.6 °F), and respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute.\\nContent: Daily fever began three months after a vacation in the Peruvian highlands. In the second week of illness, the patient developed dark urine and jaundice. A few days prior to admission, he became confused and somnolent.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Giardiasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is giardiasis, caused by the protozoan parasite Giardia intestinalis.

Toxin-induced  secretory  diarrhea  continues  independent  of  food intake. Malabsorption of carbohydrate in the small intestine leads to fermentation of unabsorbed substrates by colonic bacteria; this may cause bloating, the passage of much rectal gas and frothy stools, which are all characteristic of giardiasis. Cryptosporidiosis can involve both small and large bowel, causing short-lived and self-limiting diarrhea; however, the infection can be prolonged in patients with impaired immune responses. Cyclospora cayetanensis can also cause  acute and more chronic diarrhea with abnormalities of intestinal absorption.\\nFrequent  bowel  movements  with  small  volumes  of  stool  and  the passage  of  blood  and  mucus  suggest  colonic  infection.  Causes  of bloody diarrhea (dysentery) include invasive bacteria such as Campylobacter spp., enterohemorrhagic E. coli , and Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia spp.; nonbacterial causes include Entamoeba histolytica (amebic dysentery) and Balantidium coli , which is spread by close contact with pigs. Colicky abdominal pain is common in many gut infections and is especially severe in campylobacteriosis and yersiniosis, mimicking acute appendicitis. Fever, chills and generalized myalgia are usually associated with infection by invasive organisms; these patients appear ill and have generalized abdominal tenderness.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Cholera\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is cholera, caused by Vibrio cholerae O1, Serotype Ogawa, biotype El Tor. This was established based on the classic clinical syndrome of profuse rice-water diarrhea leading to severe dehydration and shock, combined with a clear epidemiological link to a contaminated water source during an outbreak. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by stool microscopy showing characteristic motile bacilli inhibited by specific antiserum and by positive stool culture for V. cholerae.\\nVitals: On admission, the patient was afebrile with a pulse rate of 110 bpm (low volume) and a blood pressure of 90/50 mmHg. After initial intravenous rehydration, her pulse rate improved to 84 bpm and her blood pressure rose to 100/70 mmHg.\\nContent: The patient developed profuse, large-volume watery diarrhoea, passing 12 to 15 stools in the past day. The stools were described as resembling diluted milk or rice water with white flakes. The illness was notable for the absence of abdominal pain or fever. Approximately one hour prior to presentation, she became unresponsive, prompting her husband to bring her to the hospital.\\n---\\n[SYMPTOMS]\\nContent: Intense gastrointestinal symptoms  will  follow ingestion within 30 min  to  a  few  hours.

Occasionally,  cholinergic  symptoms  are observed.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Intestinal capillariasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is intestinal capillariasis caused by the nematode Capillaria philippinensis.

Abdominal cramps were present in 83% of cases, fever in 46%, nausea and vomiting in 42%, and grossly bloody diarrhea in only 3% of cases [6, 7].\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Cholera\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is cholera, caused by Vibrio cholerae O1, Serotype Ogawa, biotype El Tor. This was established based on the classic clinical syndrome of profuse rice-water diarrhea leading to severe dehydration and shock, combined with a clear epidemiological link to a contaminated water source during an outbreak. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by stool microscopy showing characteristic motile bacilli inhibited by specific antiserum and by positive stool culture for V. cholerae.\\nVitals: On admission, the patient was afebrile with a pulse rate of 110 bpm (low volume) and a blood pressure of 90/50 mmHg. After initial intravenous rehydration, her pulse rate improved to 84 bpm and her blood pressure rose to 100/70 mmHg.\\nContent: The patient developed profuse, large-volume watery diarrhoea, passing 12 to 15 stools in the past day. The stools were described as resembling diluted milk or rice water with white flakes. The illness was notable for the absence of abdominal pain or fever. Approximately one hour prior to presentation, she became unresponsive, prompting her husband to bring her to the hospital.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

Now I’m worried because I heard some insects there can spread parasites. What could this be?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Bites,  for  example  by  the  large  aggressive  flies  variously  known  as horse flies, gadflies or cleggs (Tabanidae), may be immediately painful and traumatic but the commonest problem is delayed local swelling and itching from exposure to insects' salivary allergens incurred by previous bites. A small, intensely itchy, reddish lump with a central (hemorrhagic)  punctum  develops  immediately  or  after  a  delay  of 24-48 hours. A papule, urticarial weal, blister or bulla may develop (e.g.  after  'Blandford  fly' Simulium posticatum bites  in  Oxfordshire, UK), or bites may provoke a more generalized erythema multiforme or,  especially  in  children,  papular  urticaria,  and  sometimes  even systemic  anaphylaxis  may  be  provoked.  Triatomine  bug  bites  are usually multiple - often near the eye or angle of the mouth. They are painful, swollen, ooze blood and may be surrounded by black staining from the bug's feces (see Chapter 98, 'Chagas' Disease'). Scratching may lead to secondary infection, an inflamed, painful pustule or carbuncle, or a demarcated, hot, bright red, raised area of erysipelas or cellulitis. Causative bacteria include Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes . The risk of secondary infection seems to be higher under humid tropical conditions. It may be difficult to distinguish between  envenoming  or  allergy,  resulting  in  early  symptoms  after minutes or a few hours, and infection, resulting in late symptoms after many hours or even days.\\nFIGURE 136.2.1 Bug bite, São Paulo, Brazil (© David A. Warrell).\\n---\\n[CUTANEOUS MYIASIS [3, 4]]\\nContent: Human bot flies,  also  known  as  ver  macaque,  berne,  el  torsalo  or beefworm ( Dermatobia  hominis Oestridae),  are  a  common  cause  of dermal myiasis in Central and South America. Their eggs are deposited on biting arthropods, such as mosquitoes, which carry them to the  skin  of  the  host.  Here,  the  eggs  hatch  and  the  larvae  burrow into the skin. As the  larva grows  over a period of 10 weeks, a boil develops with a small aperture. Larvae may grow to more than 1 cm\\nremoval of the larvae, debridement of affected tissue and treatment of secondary infection. Reconstructive surgery may be required.\\nOPHTHALMOMYIASIS (OCULAR\\nMYIASIS) [5, 61\\nin  length  (Fig.  136.3.1A,  B).  An  early  symptom  is  sporadic  pain caused by the spiny larva. Unless the eye is involved, infestation is generally  harmless.  Secondary  infection  of  the  wound  is  the  most common complication.\\nTumbu flies, also known as putsi fIy or ver du cayor ( Cordylobia anthropophaga Calliphoridae),  occur  throughout  sub-Saharan  Africa  and southern  Spain.  Females  lay  their  eggs,  usually  on  urine-  or  fecescontaminated sand or moist soil, and on clothes hung outside to dry. Skin contact with viable ova on clothing results in infestation. Larvae penetrate the skin and grow rapidly to mature in about 10 days. A painful inflamed boil develops which seems to wriggle, exudes bloodstained pus and has a definite head, through which the larval spiracles may  protrude  (Fig.  136.3.2).  There  may  be  associated  fever  and lymphadenopathy.\\nLarvae of warble flies ( Hypoderma spp.)  and  horse bot  flies, Gasterophilus spp.  (Oestridae),  can  invade  human  skin  causing  intense itching and a creeping eruption.\\n---\\n[OPHTHALMOMYIASIS <OCULAR MYIASIS= [5, 6]]\\nContent: Human victims  may  give  a  history  of  having  been  buzzed  in  the face or struck on the eye by an insect and later of developing irritation and  redness  of  the  eye,  foreign  body  sensation,  pain,  lacrimation, palpebral edema and signs of purulent conjunctivitis or a stye (hordeolum). Oestrus  ovis larvae  rarely  develop  beyond  the  first  instar  in humans and so symptoms are self-limiting, but they may be more rapidly relieved by slit lamp examination and removal of larvae which cling to the conjunctivae and may cause follicular conjunctival reaction and pseudomembrane formation. Other causes of human ophthalmomyiasis  include Rhinoestrus  purpureum,  Dermatobia  hominis, Hypoderma spp.,  (Oestridae),  and Cochlyomyia  hominis,  Lucilia spp. and Phormia spp. (Calliphoridae). Larvae of Hypoderma, Cochlyomyia and Dermatobia are more dangerous as they may burrow into the eye, resulting  in  pain,  nausea  and  destruction.  They  must  be  surgically removed.\\nCongo floor maggots, larvae  of the fly Auchmeromyia luteola live  in earthen  floors  of  huts  throughout  tropical  Africa  between  latitudes 18°N and 26°S. They suck blood from those sleeping on the ground, causing local swelling and itching.\\n---\\n[FACTORS INFLUENCING TRANSMISSION]\\nContent: Other  extrinsic  factors  may  influence  whether  an  individual  insect becomes infected with a pathogen. For example, it has been shown that mosquitoes ingesting blood containing both microfilariae and Rift Valley fever virus have a higher viral infection rate because disseminated virus infection is facilitated by microfilariae escaping from the midgut into the hemocoel. Other factors can also influence this 'leaky  gut'  phenomenon.  Finally,  infection  of  the  arthropod  and subsequent transmission is influenced by the strain of pathogen. This is especially important with the arboviruses, where certain strains or subtypes of virus have greater infectivity and more rapid replication in the vectors [2].\\nBecause arthropods are cold-blooded, transmission of diseases in temperate regions is seasonal, usually only occurring during warm months. Cessation of transmission in these regions is usually determined by temperature and day length. In the tropics and subtropics, transmission generally occurs year-round. In these areas, increased seasonal transmission is most frequently correlated with the rainy season.\\n---\\n[SPECIFIC INFECTIONS TRANSMITTED BY BITING FLIES <DIPTERA= AND BUGS <HEMIPTERA=]\\nContent: - Mosquitoes  (family  Culicidae)  transmit  many  viral  infections, malaria, lymphatic filariasis and myiasis.\\n- Sandflies  (subfamily  Phlebotominae)  transmit  Phlebovirus  (Pappataci) fever, Oroya fever ( Bartonella bacilliformis ) and leishmaniasis.\\n●\\nTsetse flies (family Glossinidae) transmit African trypanosomiasis.\\n- Chrysops or deer flies (family Tabanidae) transmit Loa loa .\\n- Black flies (family Simuliidae) transmit onchocerciasis.\\n- Reduviid bugs (family Reduviidae) transmit American trypanosomiasis.\\n- Giant  water  bugs  (family  Belastomatidae)  may  transmit  Buruli ulcer.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

The condition is caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. The diagnosis was made clinically based on the presence of all five key signs: follicles on the tarsal conjunctiva, conjunctival scarring, fibrovascular pannus, trichiasis, and corneal opacity.

A frankly purulent discharge is especially common in gonococcal infections. Mucopurulent and purulent discharges frequently accumulate on the eyelashes and lid margins, causing the lids to stick together.\\nThe most consistent sign of conjunctivitis is conjunctival injection. The superficial and tortuous vessels of the conjunctiva appear dilated and bright red or pink, giving rise to the common term 'pink eye' . In severe inflammation, pseudomembranes, or even true membranes, may  be  present.  These  are  seen  as  dirty  gray  sloughs  on  the  tarsal conjunctiva. In viral and chlamydial conjunctivitis, follicles are frequently present. Giant, fleshy papillae may occur in allergic conjunctivitis. A detailed description of trachoma and inclusion conjunctivitis is provided in Chapter 35.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Ocular Surface Squamous Neoplasia\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is a clinical one of advanced Ocular Surface Squamous Neoplasia (OSSN). This is strongly supported by the patient's demographic profile (an HIV-positive woman from sub-Saharan Africa), the characteristic history of a progressively enlarging conjunctival lesion over several months, and the clinical findings of a large ocular tumor with vision loss and regional lymph node involvement. Although not confirmed by biopsy, the presentation is classic for this condition in the described epidemiological context.\\nVitals: The patient is afebrile. No other vital signs were reported.\\nContent: Symptoms began 8 months prior with a whitish lesion on the conjunctiva of her left eye. Despite treatment with non-specified eye drops from a health center and herbal eye drops from a traditional healer, the lesion grew larger and became reddish. Over the following months, she progressively lost eyesight in the affected eye and developed increasing pain, which prompted her to seek care at a district hospital.\\n---\\n[KERATITIS AND CORNEAL ULCERATION]\\nContent: Keratitis and corneal ulceration are common causes of painful, red eyes and are usually uni-ocular. Severe photophobia is often the main symptom, and the vision is usually blurred. Secondary uveitis may develop and cause ciliary injection. Ciliary injection shows a ring of redness, which is most intense around the limbus, and is a sign of inflammation of the ciliary body and iris. A history of trauma can often be elicited. At other times, a corneal ulcer and, more especially,\\nLens\\nVitreous body\\nOptic disc\\nSclera\\nFIGURE  9.2 A  diagram  of  the  front  of eye  and  a  cross-sectional  diagram  of the eye.\\nOptic nerve\\nFIGURE 9.3 Eversion of the upper eye lid.\\nkeratitis may occur as a result of viral or severe bacterial conjunctivitis, in  which  case  the  signs  of  conjunctivitis  may  coexist.  Sometimes, corneal ulcers develop spontaneously, especially with herpetic keratitis and are particularly common following measles.\\nThe most important diagnostic sign is the appearance of a corneal defect - either an opacity, which will obscure underlying iris details, or a surface defect, which will distort the surface light reflex. If an ulcer penetrates  the  cornea,  the  globe  may  collapse  and  the  intraocular contents  may be expelled.  The hole in the cornea may be plugged with a knuckle of iris which then shows as dark tissue in the base of the ulcer. A  small ulcer, such as a dendritic ulcer caused by herpes simplex, is best seen if fluorescein is instilled and the eye is observed with a blue light. Large infective ulcers frequently are filled with white sloughed material and other debris. At times, pus may accumulate in the anterior chamber as a hypopyon.\\nMost  corneal  ulcers  are  medical  emergencies  and  these  patients should be under the care of an ophthalmologist. Proper management frequently requires a microbiologic diagnosis of the infectious agent, using  isolation  cultures.  Intensive  topical  antibiotics  are  used.  For bacterial keratitis, commercially available antibiotics drops, e.g. chloramphenicol, ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin, can be used every hour.\\n---\\n[OPHTHALMOMYIASIS <OCULAR MYIASIS= [5, 6]]\\nContent: Human victims  may  give  a  history  of  having  been  buzzed  in  the face or struck on the eye by an insect and later of developing irritation and  redness  of  the  eye,  foreign  body  sensation,  pain,  lacrimation, palpebral edema and signs of purulent conjunctivitis or a stye (hordeolum).

This was confirmed by the detection of rabies viral RNA through RT-PCR in a saliva sample collected at admission. The diagnosis was strongly supported by the patient's history of a WHO category III stray dog bite in a rabies-endemic country, the rapidly progressive febrile quadriparesis, the development of autonomic instability, and the critical omission of rabies immunoglobulin during post-exposure prophylaxis. The clinical course and confirmatory laboratory test ruled out other neurological conditions considered in the differential.\\nVitals: On admission, his blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, pulse 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute, and temperature 38.5°C (101.3°F).\\nContent: A 20-year-old man presented with fever for 4 days, followed by tingling and weakness that began in his left leg and then rapidly progressed to involve all four limbs over the next 2 days. The onset of symptoms occurred about one month after a stray dog bite. After admission, he developed autonomic instability, evidenced by increased perspiration and significant variability in heart rate and blood pressure. He also developed dysphagia and respiratory distress, requiring mechanical ventilation on the third day after hospitalization. The patient died due to sudden cardiac arrest on the fifth day of hospitalization, which was nine days post-onset of symptoms.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL EFFECTS [4]]\\nContent: The patient who has been bitten by a snake may present with symptoms resulting from fear, from prehospital treatment and from effects of the venom itself. Snake bite is usually a terrifying experience, especially for those who believe that all bites are rapidly fatal. Physiologic manifestations of anxiety, and even frank hysteria, may confuse the clinical  picture. Thus, patients who are bitten, but not envenomed, may feel flushed and breathless, with constriction of the chest, and a thumping pulse,  palpitations,  sweating and  effects of  hyperventilation,  such  as  faintness,  acroparesthesia  and  even  tetany,  may  be noticed.  Such  symptoms  dominate  many  accounts  of  snake  bites written  by  the  victims  and  are  falsely  attributed  to  neurotoxicity. Misguided traditional  prehospital  treatments  can  result  in  swelling and ischemia of limbs whose circulation is occluded by tourniquets, bleeding or sensory loss resulting from local incisions, vomiting and other side effects caused by ingested herbal remedies, smarting eyes and  conjunctivitis  from  instillation  of  plant  juices,  and  bronchospasm  from  insufflation  of  oils.  Rarely,  snake  bite  may  precipitate vaso-vagal collapse, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmia.\\n---\\n[SYMPTOMS OF ENVENOMING [6-9]]\\nContent: Envenoming by H. suspectum and H. horridum causes identical clinical syndromes. Pain may start immediately and is described as throbbing or burning. It may radiate up the bitten limb to the shoulder, chest and epigastrium, and is often excruciating in intensity, persisting for 24 hours or more. Swelling also develops rapidly, extending, in some cases, to involve the whole limb, but although it may be tense, compartment  syndrome  has  never  been  described.  The  bite  site  is  erythematous  or  cyanosed  with  traumatic  ecchymoses  and  persistent bleeding, but tissue necrosis does not develop. Red lymphangitic lines extend up the limb and regional lymph glands may become tender and enlarged. Local paresthesia, hyperesthesia and even paralysis have been  described.  The  earliest  systemic  symptoms  start  within  five minutes of the bite: dizziness, weakness, nausea, vomiting, profuse generalized sweating, breathlessness and weakness. Hypotension and tachycardia are commonly recorded. These symptoms may be transient or recurrent. Less commonly, there is angioedema (swelling of lips,  tongue,  throat  and  upper  airway)  [10],  increased  secretions, chills, fever and tinnitus.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Snake bite envenomation\\nDiagnosis Details: Delayed presentation of snake bite envenomation with secondary sepsis and severe tissue necrosis. The envenomation was most likely caused by an African puff-adder (*Bitis arietans*), based on the snake's distinct physical description, its behavior, the geographic location in Malawi, and the clinical presentation of severe local cytotoxic effects (haemorrhagic bullae, massive swelling, extensive necrosis) and initial systemic haematotoxicity (bleeding gums). The patient's septic shock on arrival was a late complication of the untreated necrotic wound.\\nVitals: On admission, the patient appeared weak and was in respiratory distress. His temperature was 39.4 °C, pulse 126 bpm, blood pressure 85/60 mmHg, and respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute.\\nContent: Three weeks prior to presentation, the patient was bitten by a snake while playing in rocky grassland. The snake was described as brown with V-shaped black bands and approximately one metre long. Shortly after the bite, he developed haemorrhagic bullae on his right leg, bleeding gums, and extensive vomiting. He was initially taken to a traditional healer, after which the bleeding and vomiting resolved. However, he subsequently developed intense pain and swelling at the bite site, which progressed to the current necrotic wound.\\n---\\n[FURIOUS RABIES [5]]\\nContent: This is the more commonly recognized presentation. After a few days of prodromal symptoms, the pathognomonic symptom and sign of hydrophobia or aerophobia develops (Fig. 34.1.1). A series of forceful, jerky, inspiratory spasms is provoked either by attempts to drink water or by a draft of air on the face. Both reflexes are associated with a  compelling,  but  inexplicable  terror.  Splashing  water  on  the  skin, irritation of the respiratory tract, or, by conditioning, the sight, sound, or  even  the  mention  of  water  may  provoke  a  hydrophobic  spasm. Patients  also  experience  episodic  generalized  arousal  during  which they  become  wild,  hallucinated  and  sometimes  aggressive.  During lucid intervals, they cerebrate normally and are aware of their terrible predicament. Neurologic abnormalities include meningism, cranial nerve lesions, upper motor neuron lesions, fasciculation and involuntary  movements.  Generalized  hyperesthesia  or  hyperacusis  is described. Hypersalivation, lacrimation (Fig. 34.1.2), sweating, fluctuating blood pressure and body temperature, and diabetes insipidus, or  rarely,  inappropriate  secretion  of  antidiuretic  hormone,  suggest disturbances of the hypothalamus. Lesions of the amygdaloid nuclei probably  account  for  increased  libido,  priapism  and  spontaneous orgasms. Without intensive care, most patients die within a few days\\nFIGURE 34.1.1 Hydrophobic spasm ending in opisthotonos in an African boy with furious rabies.

What could this be?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Cutaneous larva migrans\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is cutaneous larva migrans (CLM), caused by the accidental infestation of human skin by larvae of dog and cat hookworms. This was diagnosed clinically based on the pathognomonic finding of pruritic, serpiginous tracks on the skin, supported by a clear exposure history of skin contact with sand in an endemic area (Thailand/Australia). The diagnosis was confirmed by the rapid and complete resolution of symptoms after a single dose of ivermectin.\\nContent: The patient developed three intensely itchy skin eruptions on both upper thighs just after arriving in Australia, one week prior to presentation. The itch was so severe that it kept him awake at night. He reported no fever, cough, or wheeze and was otherwise completely well.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Onchocerciasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is onchocerciasis (river blindness), caused by the filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus. The diagnosis was established based on the highly typical clinical triad of chronic pruritic dermatitis, subcutaneous nodules over bony prominences, and characteristic corneal opacities (sclerosing keratitis). This is strongly supported by the patient's lifelong residency in an endemic region of Togo near a fast-flowing river, the known breeding site for the Simulium blackfly vector.\\nContent: The patient has noticed changes in both eyes over the past 4 years, without current visual disturbances, but he is worried because adults in his village have gone blind after similar changes. For the past two decades, he has developed multiple painless bumps under his skin. He also suffers from intense itching of his skin that is severe enough to keep him awake at night.\\n---\\n[SKIN DISEASE]\\nContent: The  earliest  and  most  troublesome  symptom  of  onchocercal  skin involvement is itching [6]. The skin changes have been classified as acute papular onchodermatitis (APOD), chronic papular onchodermatitis  (CPOD),  lichenified  onchodermatitis  (LOD),  atrophy,  and depigmentation [6]. More than one skin disease type can coexist in an individual. APOD consists of small pruritic papules (Fig. 1 12.6A). Because of pruritus,  there can  be excoriations,  secondary infection, and ulceration. APOD is the typical presentation in individuals with short exposure histories, and in such individuals, microfilariae may not be detectable.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Paucibacillary leprosy\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is paucibacillary leprosy, a disease of the skin and peripheral nerves caused by Mycobacterium leprae. This diagnosis was made clinically based on the presence of two cardinal signs: a hypopigmented, anaesthetic skin macule on the right arm and a thickened right ulnar nerve. Given these definitive clinical findings, diagnostic tests like skin biopsy or slit-skin smears were not required for confirmation.\\nContent: For the past three months, the patient noticed a pale patch on his right arm and forearm. The lesion is not itchy or painful, but he reports reduced sensation in the affected area. He also complains of mild numbness of the little finger of his right hand but has experienced no weakness. He reports being generally well with no other symptoms.\\n---\\n[DISSEMINATED PRURITUS WITH OR WITHOUT RASH]\\nContent: Scabies is the most common cause of diffuse pruritic skin disease [4]. The patient complains of generalized and intense itching, worsening at  night,  usually  sparing  the  face  and  head.  Specific  skin  findings include 5- to 10-mm burrows, and papulonodular genital lesions. The classic  distribution of lesions are the interdigital web spaces, flexor surfaces of the wrists, the elbows, the axillae, the buttocks and genitalia, and on the breasts of women. Other skin changes are secondary to pruritus and include excoriation and lichenification.\\nCiguatera is a cause of localized pruritic neurosensory manifestations (perioral and distal extremity paresthesias) without cutaneous manifestations. There should be a history of fish consumption, other cases among travelers sharing the  same  meal,  a  short  incubation  period\\n(2-30 hours), and the association of gastrointestinal and neurological signs. The latter can last for months after the initial event. This fish poisoning is acquired by the ingestion of fish containing the toxins produced by the dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus toxicus , which is found in damaged coral reef systems in tropical and subtropical regions.\\nSeabather's eruption (also called sea lice) is a highly pruritic maculopapular  eruption  that  occurs  after  swimming  in  the  ocean  and  is generally confined to the skin under swimwear. It is caused by larval forms of sea  anemones  (e.g. Edwardsiella  lineata )  and  jellyfish  (e.g. Linuche unguiculata ) that become trapped under swimwear.\\nCercarial dermatitis (swimmer's itch) is also a pruritic maculopapular eruption but is predominantly distributed on uncovered body areas. It  results  from  penetration  of  the  skin  by  cercariae  of  nonhuman schistosomes while swimming in fresh water. It can last for several days.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

The initial diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis was confirmed by an AFB-positive fine-needle aspirate from a neck gland. The paradoxical IRIS was diagnosed clinically based on his worsening condition after starting ART, despite evidence of a good virologic and immunologic response. The superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis, likely with Staphylococcus aureus, was confirmed by the second aspirate showing purulent material with coccoid bacteria and the patient's rapid improvement following incision, drainage, and antibiotics.\\nVitals: On presentation, he was febrile with a temperature of 39.2 °C (102.56° F).

The clinical picture of progressive respiratory failure in an ART-naïve HIV-positive patient with a low CD4 count (150/μL), along with characteristic ground-glass infiltrates on CT imaging and a highly elevated serum β-glucan, strongly supported the diagnosis.\\nVitals: On admission, he was febrile with a temperature of 39.2 °C (102.6 °F). His blood pressure was 120/70 mmHg, pulse was 100 bpm, and respiratory rate was 26 breaths per minute. He was hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 87% on room air, which improved to 97% on 15L of oxygen.\\nContent: The patient presented with a 6-week history of progressively worsening shortness of breath, a dry cough, and drenching night sweats.

The diagnosis was made clinically based on the characteristic widespread dark-purplish plaques on the skin and palate. Pulmonary KS was strongly suspected given his chronic respiratory symptoms, exam findings, and typical chest radiograph changes, in the context of a low CD4 count (134 cells/μL). Tuberculosis, a key differential, was reasonably excluded by negative sputum and GeneXpert testing.\\nVitals: The patient's temperature was 36 °C (96.8 °F), respiratory rate was 32 breaths per minute, and pulse was 102 bpm. He appeared comfortable at rest.\\nContent: The patient presented with a one-month history of dark spots on his arm and leg, which were progressing, accompanied by new facial swelling. He also reported a three-month history of a cough productive of white sputum and worsening shortness of breath.

This diagnosis is supported by the patient's presentation with chronic undulating fever, severe malnutrition, splenomegaly, generalized lymphadenopathy, and pancytopenia. Epidemiological risk was high, as she was from a known endemic area with a family history of the disease.

Acute infectious  diarrhea  can  be  classified  into  watery  diarrhea  and  bloody diarrhea (dysentery) (Box 3.1).

Toxin-induced  secretory  diarrhea  continues  independent  of  food intake. Malabsorption of carbohydrate in the small intestine leads to fermentation of unabsorbed substrates by colonic bacteria; this may cause bloating, the passage of much rectal gas and frothy stools, which are all characteristic of giardiasis. Cryptosporidiosis can involve both small and large bowel, causing short-lived and self-limiting diarrhea; however, the infection can be prolonged in patients with impaired immune responses. Cyclospora cayetanensis can also cause  acute and more chronic diarrhea with abnormalities of intestinal absorption.\\nFrequent  bowel  movements  with  small  volumes  of  stool  and  the passage  of  blood  and  mucus  suggest  colonic  infection.  Causes  of bloody diarrhea (dysentery) include invasive bacteria such as Campylobacter spp., enterohemorrhagic E. coli , and Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia spp.; nonbacterial causes include Entamoeba histolytica (amebic dysentery) and Balantidium coli , which is spread by close contact with pigs. Colicky abdominal pain is common in many gut infections and is especially severe in campylobacteriosis and yersiniosis, mimicking acute appendicitis. Fever, chills and generalized myalgia are usually associated with infection by invasive organisms; these patients appear ill and have generalized abdominal tenderness.\\n---\\n[SYMPTOMS]\\nContent: Intense gastrointestinal symptoms  will  follow ingestion within 30 min  to  a  few  hours.  Diarrhea  may  sometimes  become  bloody. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance may follow and, in severe cases, renal dysfunction  might  ensue.  Occasionally,  cholinergic  symptoms  are observed.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Intestinal capillariasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is intestinal capillariasis caused by the nematode Capillaria philippinensis. The diagnosis was established based on the patient's clinical presentation of severe chronic diarrhoea, profound malabsorption with weight loss and oedema, and electrolyte abnormalities. Definitive confirmation was made by the identification of characteristic peanut-shaped ova on stool microscopy. The patient's residence in an endemic region and her positive clinical response to albendazole therapy further substantiated the diagnosis.\\nVitals: On presentation, the patient was afebrile, with a heart rate of 100 bpm and blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg.\\nContent: Symptoms began two months prior with stomach rumbles and colicky abdominal pain, which later progressed to anorexia and vomiting. The patient developed voluminous diarrhoea, occurring five to ten times in 24 hours, both during the day and at night, and unrelated to meals. She had been treated with various antibiotics, including metronidazole, and antidiarrhoeal drugs without any improvement. Over the last month, she developed lower limb swelling and severe prostration.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Giardiasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is giardiasis, caused by the protozoan parasite Giardia intestinalis. This was confirmed by direct microscopic identification of Giardia trophozoites and cysts in stool samples.

Lately \\nI’ve also noticed eye pain, blurry vision, and little floaters moving around in my vision. I do have a cat at home and I sometimes handle \\nthe litter box. Could this be related to an infection?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS]\\nContent: Typically, the disease begins with the abrupt onset of intense headache, fever, chills, and myalgia. Fever often exceeds 40°C (103°F) and is preceded by rigors. Muscle pain can be excruciating and occurs most commonly in the thighs, calves, lumbosacral region, and abdomen. Abdominal  wall  pain  accompanied  by  palpation  tenderness  can mimic an acute surgical abdomen. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and sore throat are other frequent symptoms. Cough and chest pain figure prominently in reports of patients from Korea and China.\\nConjunctival suffusion is a helpful diagnostic clue that usually appears two  or  three  days  after  the  onset  of  fever  and  involves  the  bulbar conjunctiva.  Pus  and  serous  secretions  are  absent  and  there  is  no matting  of  the  eyelashes  and  eyelids.  Mild  suffusion  can  easily  be overlooked. Less common and less distinctive signs include pharyngeal injection, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and skin  lesions.  Within  a  week,  most  patients  become  asymptomatic. After several days of apparent recovery, the illness resumes in some individuals. Manifestations of the second stage are more variable and mild than those of the initial illness and usually last 2-4 days. Leptospires  disappear  from  the  blood,  cerebrospinal  fluid  (CSF),  and tissues, but appear in the urine. Serum antibody titers rise - hence the term  'immune'  phase.  Meningitis  is  the  hallmark  of  this  stage  of leptospirosis. Pleocytosis of the CSF can be demonstrated in 80-90% of all patients during the second week of illness, although only about 50% will have clinical signs and symptoms of meningitis. Meningeal signs can last several weeks, but usually resolve within a day or two. Uveitis  is  a  late  manifestation  of  leptospirosis,  generally  seen  4-8 months after the illness has begun. The anterior uveal tract is most frequently affected and pain, photophobia, and blurring of vision are the usual symptoms.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Most patients with VEE have a history of exposure to mosquitoes in regions  of  humid  tropical  forests  or  have  been  present  during  an equine epizootic  [2]. Following  an  incubation  period  of  1-5  days, chills, headache, fever, body aches and prostration begin abruptly [3]. Asthenia,  dizziness  and  acute  discomfort  are  incapacitating.  Lumbosacral pain is common, along with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and a sore throat. After defervescence, a dull headache and weakness may persist for several days; fever and symptoms occasionally recrudesce. Although signs of mild neurologic involvement are common, only about 4% of infected children progress to frank neurologic disease; adults rarely do. Signs include nuchal rigidity, stupor, coma, delirium, seizures, cranial nerve palsies, motor weakness, paralysis, nystagmus, pathologic reflexes and spastic paralysis. Elevated intracranial pressure and  meningismus  occur  in  most  childhood  cases.  Approximately 0.5% of all symptomatic cases are fatal, nearly all in children. However, many survivors of neurologic disease experience sequelae, including memory problems, nervousness, asthenia, recurrent seizures, motor impairment, psychomotor retardation and behavioral disorders.\\nEastern  equine  encephalitis  typically  begins  after  3-10  days  of incubation with the sudden onset of headache, fever, chills, photophobia, dysethesias, myalgia, malaise and vomiting [1, 2, 4]. In infants, encephalitis caused by eastern equine encephalitis virus is characterized  by  abrupt  onset,  but  in  older  children  and  adults  is manifested after a few days of systemic illness. Patients may recover or  can  progress to more severe neurologic illness beginning with a worsening headache, dizziness, vomiting, lethargy and progressing to neck  stiffness,  confusion  and  convulsions.  Severe  cases  requiring hospitalization may involve seizures, disorientation and coma. The course of illness may be rapid in infants; infants are most likely to suffer neurologic sequelae,  such  as  motor  weakness, paralysis, aphasia, mental retardation and seizures. Many patients with permanent sequelae die a few years later.\\n---\\n[MILD ILLNESS]\\nContent: Enteric fever is usually insidious. Fever may gradually increase over the first week of illness. Headache, anorexia, malaise, and other nonspecific,  flu-like  symptoms  are  common  and  may  precede  fever. Abdominal complaints  including  diarrhea,  constipation,  and  nonlocalizing abdominal pain each occur in less than a third of cases, but may raise clinical suspicion [16].\\nPhysical findings are also nonspecific. Relative bradycardia, or pulsetemperature dissociation, is considered a classic sign of enteric fever, but there is no widely accepted definition of relative bradycardia and little evidence that it is a useful predictor [17]. Rose spots are small, blanching pink macular lesions, typically 2-4 mm, that usually occur on the chest, abdomen and/or back during the second week of illness, but are infrequently observed. A white, yellow or brown coating of the tongue that spares the tongue's edges is common. Mild abdominal tenderness may be present. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, if present, are usually modest.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Stevens-Johnson syndrome\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), a severe drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction. This clinical diagnosis is based on the patient's generalized maculopapular rash with extensive mucous membrane involvement (oral, conjunctival, genital), which appeared approximately four weeks after starting nevirapine and co-trimoxazole, both of which are highly implicated drugs. The diagnosis is further supported by the much higher incidence of SJS in HIV-positive individuals. Infectious causes like malaria were ruled out with negative testing.\\nVitals: Temperature is 37.7°C (99.9°F), blood pressure is 120/68 mmHg, pulse is 90 bpm, and respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute.\\nContent: The patient developed a productive cough with whitish sputum, followed one day later by a generalized skin rash that started on her trunk and spread to the extremities and mucosal membranes. Over the past two days, she also developed a sore throat and dysuria. The rash involves her lips, oral mucosa, conjunctivae, and genital mucosa, and has made talking and eating difficult and painful.\\n---\\n[OPHTHALMIC CYSTICERCOSIS]\\nContent: Cysticerci  infecting  the  eye  are  retinal  or  subretinal,  but  may  float freely in the vitreous or aqueous humors (see Fig. 127.2).

This was established based on the patient\\'s clinical presentation of fever, abdominal pain, and weight loss, combined with profound eosinophilia, multiple non-enhancing liver lesions on CT scan, and a key exposure history of consuming watercress in the Peruvian Andes. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by a positive Fas2 ELISA serology and a rapid, complete response to a single dose of triclabendazole.\\nVitals: On admission, her blood pressure was 95/60 mmHg, pulse was 105 bpm, and temperature was 38.5°C (101.3°F).\\nContent: The patient is from the Peruvian Andes. Approximately two to three months prior to her illness, she changed to a vegetarian diet and began consuming energetic hot drinks made from alfalfa and watercress. No other specific exposures or sick contacts were reported.\\n---\\n[EXPOSURE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY]\\nDisease: Angiostrongyliasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is eosinophilic meningitis caused by Angiostrongylus cantonensis (rat lungworm). This was established based on the clinical presentation of severe headache following consumption of potential intermediate hosts (snails, frogs) in an endemic area (north-east Thailand), a co-case in a family member, marked peripheral and CSF eosinophilia, and was definitively confirmed by a positive Western Blot showing specific antibodies against the 31kD A. cantonensis antigen.\\nVitals: On examination, the patient was afebrile. During a lumbar puncture, the initial cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure was elevated at 34 cm H2O.\\nContent: The patient had returned 10 days prior from a 4-week trip to north-east Thailand. During her visit, she consumed traditional regional dishes, including freshwater fish, seafood, snails, and frogs. She reported that her brother-in-law, with whom she had shared several meals, also developed a severe headache.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Giardiasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is giardiasis, caused by the protozoan parasite Giardia intestinalis. This was confirmed by direct microscopic identification of Giardia trophozoites and cysts in stool samples. The clinical presentation of greasy, foul-smelling stools, bloating, and evidence of carbohydrate malabsorption (positive reducing substances in stool) is classic for this infection.\\nVitals: The patient has no fever; no other vital signs are reported.\\nContent: For the past two weeks, the patient has experienced four to five episodes of loose stools per day, accompanied by weight loss, anorexia, malaise, flatulence, and abdominal cramping during defecation. For the last three days, he has noted bloating and distension after consuming milk products. While he has mild nausea, he reports no fever. His stools were initially watery, but after a 5-day course of ciprofloxacin from a local pharmacy (which ended two days ago), they are now three to four per day and described as mushy, greasy, and foul-smelling.\\n---\\n[SCURVY AND VITAMIN C =ASCORBIC ACID>]\\nContent: Scurvy is caused by vitamin C deficiency [22]. Humans, unlike most animals, cannot synthesize vitamin C and it is an essential vitamin obtained  primarily  from  fresh  fruit  and  vegetables,  such  as  watercress. Scurvy can develop a month after vitamin C is removed from the diet, although three months or more is more typical. Ascorbate (the active form) promotes hydroxylation of proline and lysine after their  incorporation into collagen, and the manifestations of  scurvy are primarily related to impaired connective tissue synthesis. Nondescript weakness and fatigue are followed by follicular hyperkeratosis and cutaneous petechial or ecchymotic bleeding after minor trauma. Bleeding from the oral mucosa and spongy enlargement of the gums are  common;  classically,  the  gingival  interdental  papillae  between the  teeth  are  bright  red.  Disease  progression  leads  to  depression, profound weakness, an inability of wounds to heal, the loss of all teeth,  jaundice  and  neuropathy,  before  death.  In  infants  and  children,  scurvy  is  manifested  by  tenderness  of  the  bones,  linked  to subperiosteal hemorrhage, such that they cry when their bones are touched.  Crawling  and  standing  are  avoided  because  of  the  pain. Bleeding at the osteochondral rib junctions may mimic the ricketic \\'rosary\\' of vitamin D or calcium deficiency [23]. Anemia can also be seen because of blood loss and because ascorbate promotes intestinal iron absorption.\\nEndemic scurvy no longer exists in high-income countries but persists elsewhere [24]. Scurvy occurs in those who ingest grains but not fruit [25];  in  socially  isolated  persons,  prisoners  [26]  or  alcoholics  with poor diets; and in persons with inflammatory bowel disease. Breast milk  contains  vitamin  C  and  scurvy  may  occur  in  the  infants  of vitamin C-deficient mothers. Infants and children fed grains, but not fruit, vegetables or fresh animal protein, are also at risk. Because heat destroys vitamin C, it is added to milk after pasteurization. Curing and drying fresh meat destroys the vitamin C it contains. This, and the lack of fresh vegetables or fruit, accounted for the high incidence of  scurvy  in  sailors  whom,  historically,  often  lived  solely  on  dried grains, dried vegetables, such as beans, and dried meat.\\n---\\n[EXPOSURE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY]\\nDisease: Cerebral sparganosis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is cerebral sparganosis, caused by the larva of the tapeworm *Spirometra mansoni*. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by the surgical removal and direct visualization of a live sparganum from the brain lesion in the left occipital lobe. The diagnosis was further supported by strongly positive ELISA serology for *Spirometra mansoni* in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid, as well as the characteristic \"tunnel sign\" on MRI.\\nVitals: On admission, the patient was afebrile. No other vital signs were reported.\\nContent: The patient resides in Japan, an endemic area for sparganosis. The suspected route of infection was through consumption of raw chicken meat, which he reportedly ate approximately once a month before the onset of his seizure.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.'},\n",

A few days ago I even \\nnoticed a thin, worm-like thing in my stool. Earlier this month I was traveling in a tropical area where I ate some fruits and vegetables that \\nprobably weren’t washed well. Could this be caused by something I ate?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[EPIDEMIOLOGY]\\nContent: The  differential  diagnosis,  at  the  beginning  of  the  illness,  would include pathogenic enteric bacteria or viruses. However, as the illness progresses, the differential would include other intestinal protozoa, including Giardia lamblia .  A  rare  cause  of  illness  in  travelers, Cystoisospora  belli ,  can  produce  a  prolonged  diarrhea  after  travel,  and  is sensitive to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Fatigue and weight loss can be caused by Entamoeba histolytica , but anorexia is not as prominent. Dientamoeba fragilis can cause prolonged, low-grade intestinal symptoms, but without anorexia or weight loss. Fatigue and weight loss can be due to tropical sprue, which is a rare cause of prolonged diarrhea  in  travelers.  Celiac  sprue  occasionally  manifests  during foreign travel.\\n---\\n[INTESTINAL OR ENTERAL PHASE]\\nContent: The initial consequences of infection occur within the first week after ingestion of larval worms in inadequately cooked meat (Table 1 15-2). The symptoms, reflecting mucosal irritation as adult worms develop in  the  small  intestine,  include  nausea,  abdominal  cramps,  loss  of appetite, vomiting, low-grade fever, and either mild diarrhea or constipation. Frontal headaches, dizziness, and weakness can also occur, especially in light to moderate infections. Severe diarrhea, persisting for weeks, can be seen in heavy infections. Infected Inuit Indians in North America experience an unusually high frequency of diarrhea and a low frequency of myalgia. This may reflect chronic exposure and the development of intestinal immunity [4].\\n---\\n[ASSESSMENT]\\nContent: The goals in assessing patients are to:\\n- determine if there is a persisting, treatable infection-often giardiasis or another protozoal infection;\\n- consider the possibility of gastrointestinal disease, such as celiac disease, brought to light as a consequence of intestinal infection, or IBD presenting for the first time;\\n- consider whether the patient has a disease unrelated to travel.\\nIf, after careful evaluation, an infectious cause is ruled out and there is no underlying non-infectious bowel disease, the patient is likely to have post-infectious IBS. In this case, managing persisting symptoms becomes the main objective.\\nWeight  loss  during  tropical  travels  is  common,  but  this  is  usually regained when the traveler returns to their usual diet. When this does not happen, malabsorption needs to be considered in a patient with continuing diarrhea. Pale, foul-smelling stools are typical of malabsorption. Both foul-smelling flatus and stools are typical of giardiasis. Soreness of tongue or mouth can be associated with folate deficiency, consistent with celiac disease and tropical sprue, but uncommon in giardiasis.  Tropical  sprue  is  now  uncommon  in  travellers,  perhaps related  to  the ready  use  of antibiotics  in  the treatment of travelers' diarrhea.\\nPhysical  examination  should  assess  for  abdominal  masses,  colonic tenderness,  and  organ  enlargement.  Signs  of  advanced  nutrient depletion such as glossitis, anemia, and ankle edema suggesting hypoproteinemia,  are  unusual.  It  is  essential  to  record  body  weight  at initial evaluation so that changes over time and after treatment can be monitored.\\nA history of blood in the stools needs careful evaluation. The cause may be as simple as an anal fissure from frequent bowel movements and irritation at the mucocutaneous junction, or bleeding from hemorrhoids. In these cases, small amounts of fresh blood are seen on the outside of the stool or left on the toilet paper after a bowel movement. Blood can be associated with invasive organisms, shiga-toxin producing E. coli [9], and non-infectious etiologies (Table 146-1). Colonoscopy may be is often needed to investigate non-local causes.\\n---\\n[STEPHEN G WRIGHT]\\nContent: frequently identified agent and travel to South Asia, the highest risk [6]. Although parasites are considered more common with chronic disease, bacterial diarrhea can also persist beyond a week [8].\\nWhile Giardia is the commonest parasitic cause of persisting diarrhea, Cryptosporidium spp. and, less  commonly, Cyclospora cayetanensis are also  recognized.  Amebiasis  is  uncommon  in  short-term  travelers, being  typically  seen  in  long-term  travelers  or  expatriates.  Intestinal helminths usually do not cause diarrheal symptoms with low worm burdens. Acute hookworm infection can occasionally be associated\\nTABLE 146-1 Causes of Persistent Diarrhea in Returned Travelers*\\n\\nDiarrhea with weight loss, Possible causes = Giardiasis Cryptosporidosis Cyclospora Hookworm infection (uncommon) Whipworm infection Strongyloidiasis (less common with GI symptoms) Celiac disease (gluten sensitive enteropathy) HIV/AIDS Tropical sprue (rare) In=ammatory bowel disease Colonic cancer Pancreatic disease Anatomical causes (diverticula, strictures, blind loops).

Dizziness and headaches are sometime so sudden that soldiers have been known to fall over in the trenches. Other symptoms include post-orbital  pain  (typically  exacerbated by movement), pain in  the lower limbs and back, constipation, a rash on the face, and a loss of appetite [12].

Although trench fever often results in prolonged disability, it is rarely fatal.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Most patients with VEE have a history of exposure to mosquitoes in regions  of  humid  tropical  forests  or  have  been  present  during  an equine epizootic  [2]. Following  an  incubation  period  of  1-5  days, chills, headache, fever, body aches and prostration begin abruptly [3]. Asthenia,  dizziness  and  acute  discomfort  are  incapacitating.  Lumbosacral pain is common, along with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and a sore throat. After defervescence, a dull headache and weakness may persist for several days; fever and symptoms occasionally recrudesce. Although signs of mild neurologic involvement are common, only about 4% of infected children progress to frank neurologic disease; adults rarely do. Signs include nuchal rigidity, stupor, coma, delirium, seizures, cranial nerve palsies, motor weakness, paralysis, nystagmus, pathologic reflexes and spastic paralysis. Elevated intracranial pressure and  meningismus  occur  in  most  childhood  cases.  Approximately 0.5% of all symptomatic cases are fatal, nearly all in children. However, many survivors of neurologic disease experience sequelae, including memory problems, nervousness, asthenia, recurrent seizures, motor impairment, psychomotor retardation and behavioral disorders.\\nEastern  equine  encephalitis  typically  begins  after  3-10  days  of incubation with the sudden onset of headache, fever, chills, photophobia, dysethesias, myalgia, malaise and vomiting [1, 2, 4]. In infants, encephalitis caused by eastern equine encephalitis virus is characterized  by  abrupt  onset,  but  in  older  children  and  adults  is manifested after a few days of systemic illness. Patients may recover or  can  progress to more severe neurologic illness beginning with a worsening headache, dizziness, vomiting, lethargy and progressing to neck  stiffness,  confusion  and  convulsions.  Severe  cases  requiring hospitalization may involve seizures, disorientation and coma. The course of illness may be rapid in infants; infants are most likely to suffer neurologic sequelae,  such  as  motor  weakness, paralysis, aphasia, mental retardation and seizures. Many patients with permanent sequelae die a few years later.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Mayaro fever\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was Mayaro fever, caused by Mayaro virus (MAYV). This was confirmed by serological testing showing a positive Mayaro IgM-IFA (1280 on 29 August, 40 on 12 September) and IgG-IFA (2560 on both dates) with a confirmatory plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) that rose from 40 to 160. The diagnosis aligns with the patient's travel history to the Amazon Basin, the preceding dengue-like febrile illness, and the characteristic prolonged symmetrical polyarthralgias primarily affecting small peripheral joints, while other common travel-related viral and bacterial causes were ruled out by serology.\\nVitals: No specific vital signs were reported other than the occurrence of an acute febrile illness with chills.\\nContent: During the second week of a 3.5-week trip to the Amazon Basin of northern Peru, the patient developed an acute febrile illness with chills, malaise, frontal headache, generalized myalgia, and a transient, non-pruritic maculopapular rash. The rash began on the forearms about 1 week after fever onset, spread to the trunk, neck, and face, and faded after 3 days. Slowly progressive, debilitating polyarthralgias affecting peripheral joints, with transient joint swelling, also developed. Painful cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy lasted for about 1 week. Fever and other acute symptoms subsided within 1 week, but polyarthralgias persisted, showing a symmetrical pattern mainly affecting the small joints of the hands and feet, wrists, ankles, and knees. Upon return to Switzerland a few weeks later, the patient reported stiffness of the affected joints, mainly in the morning and after immobility, and the joint pains did not improve for two more months.\\n---\\n[FEBRILE ILLNESSES]\\nContent: Priority  should  be  given  to  identifying  illnesses  that  can  be  fatal rapidly or pose a threat to public health. Delayed diagnosis of Plasmodium  falciparum malaria  can  be  lethal,  and  undiagnosed  TB  or measles can lead to secondary cases.\\nFever  soon  after  immigration  from  malarial  countries  could  be malaria; 90% of P. falciparum cases occur within 1 month of arrival. Fever with rash suggests dengue, while fever with rash and arthritis may  indicate  chikungunya  virus.  Early  fevers  may  also  be  due  to typhoid  and  paratyphoid  fevers,  rickettsial  infections,  and  amebic liver abscesses. Fever months after migration may be caused by TB, primary malarial infection, or relapse of P. vivax and P.  ovale. Many less  common infections can be associated with fever, though other accompanying  signs  and  symptoms  may  suggest  these  diagnoses. Other febrile illness with short incubation periods, such as influenza or meningococcemia, can occur in immigrants exposed after migration, but may be more relevant to returning travelers [8]. This chapter will focus on infectious diseases that can be seen by clinicians at any time following migration and that are likely to be related to the individual's country of origin or migration process.\\n---\\n[CHIEF COMPLAINT]\\nDisease: Falciparum malaria\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is Plasmodium falciparum malaria with clinical treatment failure. The initial diagnosis was confirmed by a positive slide prior to admission and a positive HRP-2 RDT on admission. The treatment failure was not due to drug resistance but to the administration of a substandard antimalarial drug (intramuscular artemether) that contained significantly less active ingredient than stated. This was confirmed by the patient's rapid clinical response to a standard-of-care regimen of quinine and doxycycline and subsequent laboratory analysis of the drug vial.\\nVitals: On admission, he was febrile with a temperature of 39.5 °C (103.1 °F).

Following  an  incubation  period  of  1-5  days, chills, headache, fever, body aches and prostration begin abruptly [3]. Asthenia,  dizziness  and  acute  discomfort  are  incapacitating.  Lumbosacral pain is common, along with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and a sore throat. After defervescence, a dull headache and weakness may persist for several days; fever and symptoms occasionally recrudesce. Although signs of mild neurologic involvement are common, only about 4% of infected children progress to frank neurologic disease; adults rarely do. Signs include nuchal rigidity, stupor, coma, delirium, seizures, cranial nerve palsies, motor weakness, paralysis, nystagmus, pathologic reflexes and spastic paralysis. Elevated intracranial pressure and  meningismus  occur  in  most  childhood  cases.  Approximately 0.5% of all symptomatic cases are fatal, nearly all in children. However, many survivors of neurologic disease experience sequelae, including memory problems, nervousness, asthenia, recurrent seizures, motor impairment, psychomotor retardation and behavioral disorders.\\nEastern  equine  encephalitis  typically  begins  after  3-10  days  of incubation with the sudden onset of headache, fever, chills, photophobia, dysethesias, myalgia, malaise and vomiting [1, 2, 4]. In infants, encephalitis caused by eastern equine encephalitis virus is characterized  by  abrupt  onset,  but  in  older  children  and  adults  is manifested after a few days of systemic illness. Patients may recover or  can  progress to more severe neurologic illness beginning with a worsening headache, dizziness, vomiting, lethargy and progressing to neck  stiffness,  confusion  and  convulsions.  Severe  cases  requiring hospitalization may involve seizures, disorientation and coma. The course of illness may be rapid in infants; infants are most likely to suffer neurologic sequelae,  such  as  motor  weakness, paralysis, aphasia, mental retardation and seizures. Many patients with permanent sequelae die a few years later.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

The time from infection to clinical disease is approximately 10 days to the onset of fever and 14 days to the onset of rash. Persons with measles are infectious for several days before and after the onset of rash, when levels of measles virus in blood and body fluids are highest and when the symptoms of cough, coryza and sneezing are most severe. The host immune response at sites of virus replication is responsible for the signs and symptoms of measles.\\nFIGURE 28.1.1 Reported measles cases with date of  onset  between  July  2010  and  January  2011 (redrawn  from  World  Health  Organization.

Physical examination should focus on the clinical features of measles, specifically Koplik's spots and rash, as well as potential sites of secondary  infections,  including pneumonia  and  otitis media. Appropriate precautions need to be taken to prevent transmission within healthcare settings.\\nMeasles is readily diagnosed on clinical grounds by clinicians familiar with  the  disease,  particularly  during  outbreaks.  Koplik's  spots  are especially helpful as they appear before the rash and are pathognomonic  (Fig.  28.1.4).  Clinical  diagnosis  is  more  difficult  in  regions where  the  incidence  of  measles  is  low,  as  other  pathogens  are\\nB\\nFIGURE  28.1.5 Measles  rash.

The World Health Organization (WHO) clinical case definition for measles consists of any person with fever and maculopapular rash  (i.e.  non-vesicular),  and  cough,  coryza  or  conjunctivitis  [13]. Although this is not very specific, it is devised primarily for outbreak control and monitoring, rather than clinical use.\\nThe detection of measles virus-specific IgM in a single specimen of serum or oral fluid is considered diagnostic of acute infection and is the most common method of laboratory confirmation (Fig. 28.1.7) [14]. IgM antibodies may not be detectable until four days or more after  rash  onset  and  usually  fall  to  undetectable  levels  within  4-8 weeks of rash onset. Alternatively, acute infection can be confirmed with a fourfold, or greater, increase in measles virus-specific IgG antibody levels between acute and convalescent sera. The presence of IgG antibodies in a single serum specimen is evidence of prior infection\\n---\\n[VIRAL INFECTIONS WITH CUTANEOUS LESIONS]\\nContent: 28\\nrecently, progress has been made in sub-Saharan Africa as a consequence of increasing routine measles vaccine coverage and provision of  a  second  opportunity  for  measles  vaccination  through  mass measles vaccination campaigns [2].\\n- Highly contagious mucocutaneous disease caused by measles virus\\n- One of the most important infectious diseases of humans, responsible for millions of deaths prior to the development of measles vaccines\\n- Prodromal illness characterized by fever, cough, coryza and conjunctivitis\\n- Koplik's spots, small white lesions on the buccal mucosa, appear before the rash\\n- Characteristic erythematous and maculopapular rash appears ?rst on the face and behind the ears and then spreads to the trunk and extremities\\n- Widespread use of measles vaccines has resulted in dramatic declines in incidence and mortality\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Clinically, features  begin  with  a  prodromal  illness  characterized  by fever,  cough,  coryza  and  conjunctivitis  (Fig.  28.1.3).  Koplik's  spots (small white lesions on the buccal mucosa) may be visible during the prodrome and allow the astute clinician to diagnose measles prior to the onset of rash (Fig. 28.1.4). The prodromal symptoms intensify several days before the onset of rash. A characteristic erythematous and maculopapular rash appears, first on the face and behind the ears, and then spreads, in a centrifugal fashion, to the trunk and extremities (Fig. 28.1.5). The rash lasts for 3-4 days and fades in the same manner as  it  appeared.  Malnourished  children  may  develop  a  deeply  pigmented rash that desquamates or peels during recovery [8].\\nIn uncomplicated measles, clinical recovery begins soon after appearance of the rash. Complications can occur in up to 40% of measles cases; the risk  of complication is increased by extremes of age and malnutrition (Fig. 28.1.6).

Pneumonia  is  caused  by  secondary  viral  or bacterial infections, or  by the measles virus itself. Other respiratory complications  include  laryngotracheobronchitis  (croup)  and  otitis media. Mouth ulcers, or stomatitis, may hinder children from eating or  drinking.  Many  children  with  measles  develop  diarrhea,  which further contributes to malnutrition.

       "    'content': \"PATIENT QUESTION:\\nI got a cut a little over a week ago while working outdoors, and lately my jaw has been getting really stiff. Now I’m having trouble swallowing, \\nmy neck feels tight, and I’m getting these painful muscle spasms that come out of nowhere when I hear a loud noise or someone touches me. \\nI don’t remember when I last got a tetanus shot. What could be happening?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Tetanus can produce a spectrum of clinical features depending on the site  of  infection  and  the  amount  of  toxin  produced.  In  its  mildest form, isolated areas of the body are affected and only local muscle spasm may be apparent. In such cases, outcome is usually good, with the  important  exception  of  cephalic  tetanus.  In  this  condition,  the cranial nerves are involved and phargyngeal or laryngeal muscles may spasm,  leading  to  sudden  aspiration  or  airway  obstruction.  These patients require careful observation.\\nGeneralized muscle spasm is the most typical feature of tetanus. The muscles  of  the  face  and  jaw  are  often  affected  first,  producing  the characteristic  'risus  sardonicus'  and  trismus  (lockjaw)  [3].  Many patients also experience difficulty swallowing, back pain, and generalized muscle pain and stiffness. Neonates typically present with difficulty in feeding. As the disease progresses, generalized muscle spasms develop, which can be very painful. Commonly, the laryngeal muscles are  involved  early,  which  can  be  life-threatening  as  it  may  lead  to sudden and complete airway obstruction. Spasm  of the respiratory muscles results in respiratory failure and, without mechanical ventilation,  is  the  commonest  cause  of  death.  Spasms  strong  enough  to produce tendon avulsions and crush fractures have been reported, but are rare.\\nAutonomic disturbance is maximal during the second week of the illness and can be fatal. Blood pressure, heart rate and temperature can fluctuate wildly, and can be associated with gastrointestinal stasis, sweating and increased secretions.\\nRapid development of tetanus is associated with more severe disease and poor outcome. The incubation period (time from wound to first symptom) and period of onset (time from first symptom to the first generalized spasm) are of particular significance, with shorter times associated  with  worse  outcome.  Likewise,  in  neonatal  tetanus,  the younger the infant when symptoms occur, the worse the prognosis (Fig. 55.1).\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Tetanus\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is tetanus. This was established clinically based on the initial presentation of trismus ('stiffness of the mouth') which progressed to generalized muscle spasms and dysphagia. The diagnosis was strongly supported by her epidemiological risk factors, including being an agricultural worker from a country with low vaccination rates. The clinical course, with worsening spasms despite initial treatment, is characteristic of the disease as the toxin continues to affect the nervous system.\\nVitals: On initial presentation, her pulse, blood pressure, and respiratory rate were all within normal limits. No fever was reported.\\nContent: The patient developed difficulty chewing and stiffness of the mouth three days after arriving in Europe from her home in rural Ethiopia. She reported that this symptom had never occurred before. The initial symptom was trismus, which is a common early presentation for tetanus as the muscles of mastication have the shortest motor neurons.\\n---\\n[FINAL DIAGNOSIS]\\nDisease: Tetanus\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is tetanus. This was established clinically based on the initial presentation of trismus ('stiffness of the mouth') which progressed to generalized muscle spasms and dysphagia. The diagnosis was strongly supported by her epidemiological risk factors, including being an agricultural worker from a country with low vaccination rates. The clinical course, with worsening spasms despite initial treatment, is characteristic of the disease as the toxin continues to affect the nervous system.\\nVitals: On initial presentation, her pulse, blood pressure, and respiratory rate were all within normal limits. No fever was reported.\\n---\\n[TREATMENT]\\nContent: The best way to control the severe muscle spasms of tetanus has not been defined by controlled trials. Most authorities, however, use highdose  benzodiazepines  (up  to  100 mg/hour  diazepam  has  been reported) in combination with other drugs, such as chlorpromazine or phenobarbitone [8]. More recently, intravenous magnesium sulfate has been used as a muscle relaxant [9].\\nThe problem with all these treatments is that the doses necessary to control  spasms  also  cause  respiratory  depression,  thus  controlling spasms, while maintaining adequate ventilation is a particular issue in settings without facilities  for  mechanical  ventilation. Respiratory failure is a common cause of death in these circumstances. If mechanical ventilation is available, severe spasms are best dealt with using a combination of benzodiazepines, magnesium, and relatively shortacting, cardiovascularly inert, nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents, as they allow titration against spasm intensity. Infusions of propofol have also been used successfully to control spasms and provide sedation.\\nThe autonomic disturbance of severe tetanus is notoriously difficult to  treat.  A  recent,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  trial  of  intravenous  magnesium  sulfate  (plasma  concentrations  2-4 mmol/l)  for severe tetanus found treatment with magnesium was associated with reduced requirements for benzodiazepines, nondepolarizing muscle relaxants  (pipecuronium),  and  verapamil  (used  for  the  control  of tachycardia)  [10].  In  addition  to  magnesium,  morphine  and  drugs acting specifically on the cardiovascular system (e.g. esmolol, calcium antagonists, and inotropes) may be required.\\nComplications arising  from the treatment of tetanus are common. Ventilator-associated pneumonia, central venous catheter infections, and septicemia are particularly important. In some centers, prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis and thromboembolism is routine.\\nRecovery from tetanus may take 4-6 weeks with prolonged immobility secondary to muscle stiffness. In addition, patients must be given a  full  primary  course  of  immunization,  as  tetanus  toxin  is  poorly immunogenic and does not provoke a protective immune response.\\n---\\n[KEY FEATURES]\\nContent: - Tetanus is a neurologic syndrome characterized by acute skeletal muscle spasm and autonomic nervous system disturbance, caused by a neurotoxin released from Cl o st r i di um  t et ani , a ubiquitous environmental bacterium that can contaminate wounds\\n- Tetanus can be completely prevented by vaccination, yet more than 100,000 people develop tetanus each year, primarily in regions with inadequate vaccination programs\\n- Tetanus is a clinical diagnosis. The cardinal clinical features are muscle spasms, airway obstruction, and (in severe cases) autonomic dysfunction\\n- At diagnosis, the management priorities are to secure the airway, administer antitoxin immune globulins and debride potentially infected wounds\\n- Spasms can be controlled with high-dose benzodiazepines; magnesium sulfate infusions may help control spasms and autonomic dysfunction\\n- Disease does not confer immunity: vaccinate all survivors\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by stool microscopy showing characteristic motile bacilli inhibited by specific antiserum and by positive stool culture for V. cholerae.\\nVitals: On admission, the patient was afebrile with a pulse rate of 110 bpm (low volume) and a blood pressure of 90/50 mmHg. After initial intravenous rehydration, her pulse rate improved to 84 bpm and her blood pressure rose to 100/70 mmHg.\\nContent: The patient developed profuse, large-volume watery diarrhoea, passing 12 to 15 stools in the past day. The stools were described as resembling diluted milk or rice water with white flakes. The illness was notable for the absence of abdominal pain or fever. Approximately one hour prior to presentation, she became unresponsive, prompting her husband to bring her to the hospital.\\n---\\n[INTRODUCTION]\\nContent: Up to 70% of travelers to developing countries report health problems,  the  majority  of  which  are  self-limiting;  however  8-15%  of travelers are ill enough to seek medical attention while abroad or on return home, with fever as a common presenting complaint [1-4]. While  for  many  the  underlying  cause  is  a  self-limiting  globally endemic infection, such as gastroenteritis, physicians are increasingly encountering conditions not normally seen in the patient's country of origin. In some cases these are potentially life-threatening, such as malaria, and others have potential public health consequences, such as enteric fever.\\nTo evaluate returned travelers presenting with fever, an understanding of the geographic distribution of infections, risk factors for acquisition, incubation periods and clinical presentations is required. With this understanding, a risk assessment can be undertaken, initial investigations  instigated,  and,  when  appropriate,  presumptive  therapy started.\\n---\\n[ASSESSMENT]\\nContent: The goals in assessing patients are to:\\n- determine if there is a persisting, treatable infection-often giardiasis or another protozoal infection;\\n- consider the possibility of gastrointestinal disease, such as celiac disease, brought to light as a consequence of intestinal infection, or IBD presenting for the first time;\\n- consider whether the patient has a disease unrelated to travel.\\nIf, after careful evaluation, an infectious cause is ruled out and there is no underlying non-infectious bowel disease, the patient is likely to have post-infectious IBS. In this case, managing persisting symptoms becomes the main objective.\\nWeight  loss  during  tropical  travels  is  common,  but  this  is  usually regained when the traveler returns to their usual diet. When this does not happen, malabsorption needs to be considered in a patient with continuing diarrhea. Pale, foul-smelling stools are typical of malabsorption. Both foul-smelling flatus and stools are typical of giardiasis. Soreness of tongue or mouth can be associated with folate deficiency, consistent with celiac disease and tropical sprue, but uncommon in giardiasis.  Tropical  sprue  is  now  uncommon  in  travellers,  perhaps related  to  the ready  use  of antibiotics  in  the treatment of travelers' diarrhea.\\nPhysical  examination  should  assess  for  abdominal  masses,  colonic tenderness,  and  organ  enlargement.  Signs  of  advanced  nutrient depletion such as glossitis, anemia, and ankle edema suggesting hypoproteinemia,  are  unusual.  It  is  essential  to  record  body  weight  at initial evaluation so that changes over time and after treatment can be monitored.\\nA history of blood in the stools needs careful evaluation. The cause may be as simple as an anal fissure from frequent bowel movements and irritation at the mucocutaneous junction, or bleeding from hemorrhoids. In these cases, small amounts of fresh blood are seen on the outside of the stool or left on the toilet paper after a bowel movement. Blood can be associated with invasive organisms, shiga-toxin producing E. coli [9], and non-infectious etiologies (Table 146-1). Colonoscopy may be is often needed to investigate non-local causes.\\n---\\n[FEVER IN THE RETURNED TRAVELER]\\nContent: Victoria Johnston, Michael Brown example,  gastroenteritis  or  respiratory  tract  infections,  particularly upper respiratory tract infections - are common.

What condition\\nshould be suspected, and what is the underlying cause?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[PATIENT EVALUATION]\\nContent: The  classical  finding  in  acute  viral  hepatitis  is  jaundice,  although patients with milder infections may have bilirubin levels below the 2.0-2.5 mg/dL  in  which  jaundice  is  not  detectable.  Patients  with chronic hepatitis usually do not have jaundice. In both conditions, the patient has other symptoms and signs listed in other sections. The classic laboratory abnormalities of acute hepatitis are elevated serum ALT and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 10-20 times higher than normal. The serum bilirubin is usually elevated, often peaking 10-15times normal. Clinical jaundice is noted when it exceeds 2.5-3.0 mg/ dL.  There  may  be  elevations  in  alkaline  phosphatase,  and  atypical lymphocytes can be noted in the peripheral blood film in the presence of a normal leukocyte count. Bilirubin is often also present in the urine. These laboratory abnormalities can help detect mild and asymptomatic cases [2, 25].\\nDiagnosis of anicteric cases of hepatitis are often based upon obtaining a history of potential exposures to patients with hepatitis or risk factors of infection. The severity of acute viral hepatitis is best measured by the clinical symptoms and serum levels of bilirubin, ALT or AST. The severity of chronic hepatitis is best measured by these same findings and may be supplemented by liver biopsy, ultrasonography and other noninvasive tests of hepatic fibrosis.\\nEach  virus  elicits  a  characteristic  antibody  response.  Detection  of virus-specific IgM class immunoglobulins generally represents acute infection, while IgG antibodies may be present years after resolution of  disease.  Recognition  of  viral  antigens  or  nucleic  acid  represents ongoing infection and correlates with transmissibility.\\n---\\n[APPROACH TO LIVER DISEASE]\\nContent: The evaluation of the liver should determine the site of hepatic injury, the underlying etiology and the severity of the liver disease. Conceptually,  liver  disease  can  be  divided  into:  'pre-hepatic',  involving  the portal  vein  or  hepatic  artery;  'hepatic',  involving  the  parenchymal lobule,  including  hepatocytes,  biliary  and  vascular  sinusoids;  and 'post-hepatic', involving the hepatic vein or biliary systems. Characterizing  liver  abnormalities  may  involve  a  combination  of  clinical, biochemical,  serologic, microbiologic, radiologic and  histologic investigations. These evaluations should be refined by knowledge of the geographic distribution of each condition, and understanding of risk  factors  for  each  disease.  Evaluation  should  include  a  detailed history encompassing a review of symptoms (including right upper quadrant pain or discomfort, anorexia, jaundice, darkened urine, pruritus, fever), underlying conditions, past vaccination history and epidemiologic exposures (including exposures to water, food, blood and animals,  and  sexual  practices).  Examination  should  include  assessment of signs  and  findings  consistent  with  liver  disease,  including jaundice, occurrence of smooth-surfaced white spots or patches under the nails  (leukonychia), palmar erythema, spider nevi and gynecomastia. Hepatomegaly can be associated with most causes of hepatitis and liver lesions, while splenomegaly in the context of liver disease represents  either  portal  hypertension  or  an  underlying  cause,  such as malaria.\\nThe inaccurately termed 'liver function tests' can be used to refine the site of liver disease (Fig. 4.1). Bilirubin is a breakdown product of\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Spinal cord schistosomiasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The patient was diagnosed with spinal cord schistosomiasis complicating an infection with Schistosoma haematobium. The diagnosis was established based on the clinical presentation of a conus syndrome, a clear exposure history of swimming in Lake Malawi, the prior identification of S. haematobium eggs in his urine, significant peripheral eosinophilia, and characteristic MRI findings of a lesion in the conus medullaris and bladder wall thickening. His complete recovery following treatment with praziquantel and corticosteroids further supports the diagnosis.\\nVitals: He has normal vital signs; specific values were not reported.\\nContent: For three weeks, the patient experienced progressive difficulty urinating, requiring increasing abdominal pressure and only being able to pass small amounts at a time, associated with lower abdominal discomfort, abnormal sensations in the groins and genitals, and some erectile dysfunction. He also reports that walking did not feel normal, though he could not specify the abnormality. He denies weakness, dysaesthesia, or loss of sensation in his legs, and has no backache. Over the past two months, he had an unintentional weight loss of 8kg and fatigue without fever or night sweats. One week prior to presentation, he noticed a single episode of reddish urine discoloration without painful micturition or fever, for which he was treated at a local clinic. There is no history of trauma.\\n---\\n[CIRRHOSIS]\\nContent: Ten  to  twenty  percent  of  HCV-infected  patients  develop  cirrhosis over  a  period  of  15-30  years.  Once  cirrhosis  develops,  marked fatigue,  muscle  weakness  and  wasting,  fluid  retention  with  edema and  ascites,  easy  bruising,  dark  urine,  jaundice,  itching  and  upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage can occur. Hepatic failure is more likely in  those  who  have  additional  causes  of  liver  disease,  for  example schistosomiasis, concomitant HBV or HIV, and alcoholic liver disease. Staging of the fibrosis as detected on liver biopsy can predict clinical outcomes, the need for liver transplantation and liver-related death [83].\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Hyperreactive Malarial Splenomegaly\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is Hyperreactive Malarial Splenomegaly (HMS) due to chronic Plasmodium falciparum infection. This was established based on the combination of massive splenomegaly, characteristic bicytopenia, markedly elevated polyclonal IgM, a positive P. falciparum serology (IFAT 1:256), and a positive P. falciparum PCR despite negative blood smears. The diagnosis was further supported by his origin from a malaria-endemic region (rural Mali) and a favorable clinical response to antimalarial therapy, with resolution of fever.\\nVitals: On examination, the patient was afebrile with a temperature of 36.1 °C (96.98 °F). Blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg and pulse was 64 bpm.\\nContent: The patient presented after a haematology work-up for splenomegaly and bicytopenia failed to establish an underlying condition. Clinically, he felt quite well, reporting only intermittent fever and abdominal heaviness. He denied night sweats and reported his weight was stable.

This is supported by the clinical triad of fever and tender hepatomegaly with right intercostal tenderness, imaging findings of a large solitary liver lesion with an elevated hemidiaphragm, and the aspiration of characteristic 'brownish pus'. The diagnosis was further confirmed by the patient's rapid clinical response to metronidazole therapy and the relevant epidemiological risk factor of consuming locally brewed alcohol known to be associated with amoebiasis.\\nVitals: On examination, the patient's temperature was 38.3 °C (100.8 °F), blood pressure was 100/80 mmHg, pulse was 102 bpm, and respiratory rate was 24 breath cycles per minute.\\nContent: For the past week, the patient experienced fever, chills, headache, and body aches, along with severe right-hypochondrial pain. The abdominal pain is described as constant, dull, radiating to the right shoulder, and exacerbated by coughing and resting on the right side. Over the last few days, he also developed a dry cough, has vomited twice, and has lost his appetite.\\n---\\n[GASTROINTESTINAL]\\nContent: Prolonged constipation or dysphagia among immigrants from Latin America  south  of  the  equator  can  indicate  chronic  Chagas  disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi . Infected individuals can have symptoms of achalasia, or evidence of megaesophagus or megacolon. Infection can  be  diagnosed  by  testing  for  IgG  antibodies.  Infection  can  be transmitted  congenitally  and  through  blood  donation;  the  US, Canada, parts of Latin and South America, and parts of Europe routinely test blood donors for infection.\\nJaundice may be associated with hepatitis, schistosomiasis, or the liver fluke Clonorchis  sinensis .  Hepatitis  A  and  B  can  also  present  with abdominal pain, but may be accompanied by fatigue, nausea, and jaundice. Acute hepatitis A is unusual in older immigrants from developing countries because of prior infection. Hepatitis B and C infection may be asymptomatic and put the individual at risk for late complications of cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma.

Infectious etiologies are responsible for the majority of fevers.\\nTuberculosis should be considered in all patients with fever especially if cough, shortness of breath, weight loss, night sweats, or lymphadenopathy are present (see Chapter 39, ' Tuberculosis ') [131]. Other causes of fever are cryptococcal disease (e.g. C. neoformans bloodstream infection),  bacteremia  (e.g. Salmonella , Rhodococcus ),  pneumonia,  both bacterial (e.g. S.  pneumoniae )  and  fungal (e.g. PCP), malaria, CMV, and lymphoma. Multiple concurrent etiologies occur.\\nThe  diagnostic  work-up  for  fever  should  be  driven  by  the  clinical presentation and availability of diagnostic tests. Blood cultures, blood smear for malaria, mycobacterial blood cultures and serum cryptococcal antigen testing can be helpful.

The incubation period for most enterovirus infections has not been accurately determined. In the case of poliovirus, the incubation period is typically 3-5 days but may occasionally extend up to 2 weeks. Virus is  shed in the respiratory secretions for 1 week and in the feces for 2-4 weeks or longer. People are most infectious during the incubation period and for the first 2-3 days after the onset of symptoms.

Enteroviruses 70, 71 and several coxsackievirus A strains are also associated with acute flaccid paralysis mimicking  poliomyelitis  and  numerous  case  reports  have  linked other enteroviruses with this syndrome.\\n---\\n[ENTEROVIRUS 71 INFECTION OF THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (CNS)]\\nContent: Enterovirus 71 and coxsackievirus A16 are the commonest causes of hand-foot-and-mouth disease and herpangina.

(B) A  patient being treated in a negative pressure ventilator ('iron lung') because of bulbar poliomyelitis.\\ncoxsackievirus A16, enterovirus 71 infection can be complicated by acute neurologic disease, including aseptic meningitis, poliomyelitislike  paralysis  and  brainstem  encephalitis.  Brainstem  encephalitis caused by enterovirus 71 infection occurs mostly in children under 4 years of age and is associated with a high mortality as a result of a rapid onset neurogenic pulmonary edema and cardiovascular collapse.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Most  enteroviral  infections  are  asymptomatic  or  associated  with  a nonspecific  febrile  illness.  Signs  and  symptoms  of  respiratory  tract infection (coryza, pharyngitis and pneumonia) and herpangina (multiple  oral  ulcers  at  the  back  of  the  oral  cavity)  may  occur,  but  it remains unclear if enteroviruses are a significant cause of vomiting, diarrhea  or  abdominal  pain.  Rare,  serious  clinical  manifestations include  neonatal  sepsis,  meningoencephalitis  and  myopericarditis. Infection with enterovirus 71 can result in pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage and cardiopulmonary failure. Chronic enterovirus infection can occur in persons with defective B-lymphocyte function, including  those  with  X-linked  agammaglobulinemia,  severe  combined immunodeficiency or common variable immunodeficiency.\\nIndividuals with acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis have abrupt onset of eye pain, photophobia and swelling of the eyelids. Fever, headache and  pre-auricular  lymphadenopathy  may  occur.  Subconjunctival hemorrhage is the characteristic clinical manifestation and occurs in the majority of ocular infections caused by enterovirus 70 but is less common with coxsackievirus A24 ocular infection. Signs and symptoms typically peak on the first day of infection and resolve within several days without complications.\\nChildren  with  HFMD  usually  present  with  fever,  sore  throat  and refusal to eat. Physical examination reveals vesicles and ulcers on the buccal mucosa and tongue, and papules and vesicles with surrounding erythema on the hands, feet, wrists, ankles, buttocks and genitalia. HFMD caused by enterovirus 71 and coxsackievirus A16 is usually indistinguishable, although some observers state that the skin lesions associated with coxsackievirus A16 infection are larger and the lesions of enterovirus 71 infection are more commonly papular and petechial [7]. Rarely, HFMD caused by enterovirus 71 may be associated with severe neurologic complications, including aseptic meningitis, brainstem or cerebellar encephalitis, and acute flaccid paralysis (see Chapter 34.2). Permanent paralysis or death can result.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Approximately 80% of human WNV infections are asymptomatic [7]. In clinical infections, the incubation period usually is 2-6 days, but can be up to 21 days in immunocompromised people. Most symptomatic persons experience an acute systemic febrile illness that often includes headache, myalgia or arthralgia; gastrointestinal symptoms and a transient maculopapular rash also are commonly reported. Less than  1%  of  infected  people  develop  neuroinvasive  disease,  which typically manifests as meningitis, encephalitis, or acute flaccid paralysis.  Patients  with  encephalitis  may  present  with  seizures,  mental status changes, focal neurologic deficits or movement disorders. WNV acute flaccid paralysis is often clinically and pathologically identical to  poliomyelitis  caused  by  polioviruses,  with  damage  of  anterior horn cells in the spinal cord (anterior myelitis); it  may progress to respiratory paralysis requiring mechanical ventilation. WNVassociated Guillain-Barré syndrome has also been reported and can be distinguished from WNV myelitis by clinical manifestations and electrophysiologic testing. Cardiac dysrhythmias, myocarditis, rhabdomyolysis, optic neuritis, uveitis, chorioretinitis, orchitis, pancreatitis and hepatitis have been rarely described after WNV infection.\\nMost  patients  with  WNV  non-neuroinvasive  disease  or  meningitis recover completely, but fatigue, malaise and weakness can linger for weeks or months [7, 8]. Patients who recover from WNV encephalitis or  myelitis  often  have  residual  neurologic  deficits.  Among  patients with  neuroinvasive  disease,  the  overall  case-fatality  rate  is  approximately 10%, but it is significantly higher in WNV encephalitis and myelitis than in WNV meningitis.

Brainstem  encephalitis caused by enterovirus 71 infection occurs mostly in children under 4 years of age and is associated with a high mortality as a result of a rapid onset neurogenic pulmonary edema and cardiovascular collapse.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Approximately 80% of human WNV infections are asymptomatic [7]. In clinical infections, the incubation period usually is 2-6 days, but can be up to 21 days in immunocompromised people. Most symptomatic persons experience an acute systemic febrile illness that often includes headache, myalgia or arthralgia; gastrointestinal symptoms and a transient maculopapular rash also are commonly reported. Less than  1%  of  infected  people  develop  neuroinvasive  disease,  which typically manifests as meningitis, encephalitis, or acute flaccid paralysis.  Patients  with  encephalitis  may  present  with  seizures,  mental status changes, focal neurologic deficits or movement disorders. WNV acute flaccid paralysis is often clinically and pathologically identical to  poliomyelitis  caused  by  polioviruses,  with  damage  of  anterior horn cells in the spinal cord (anterior myelitis); it  may progress to respiratory paralysis requiring mechanical ventilation. WNVassociated Guillain-Barré syndrome has also been reported and can be distinguished from WNV myelitis by clinical manifestations and electrophysiologic testing. Cardiac dysrhythmias, myocarditis, rhabdomyolysis, optic neuritis, uveitis, chorioretinitis, orchitis, pancreatitis and hepatitis have been rarely described after WNV infection.\\nMost  patients  with  WNV  non-neuroinvasive  disease  or  meningitis recover completely, but fatigue, malaise and weakness can linger for weeks or months [7, 8]. Patients who recover from WNV encephalitis or  myelitis  often  have  residual  neurologic  deficits.  Among  patients with  neuroinvasive  disease,  the  overall  case-fatality  rate  is  approximately 10%, but it is significantly higher in WNV encephalitis and myelitis than in WNV meningitis. Risk factors for developing neuroinvasive disease include older age and history of solid organ transplantation;  other  immunocompromising  conditions,  diabetes,  and hypertension are suspected risk factors.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: In taking the history, establish whether a patience comes from a rural area where Japanese encephalitis occurs and also whether there is an\\n011\\nFIGURE 34.4.4 (A) Opisthotonus and other movement disorders are common in Japanese encephalitis (photo courtesy of T.

Typically,  children  with  encephalitis present with a few days history of flu-like illness, usually involving a severe  headache,  and  may  include  coryza,  diarrhea,  and  vomiting. This is followed by a reduction in the level of consciousness, often heralded by a seizure.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Most patients with VEE have a history of exposure to mosquitoes in regions  of  humid  tropical  forests  or  have  been  present  during  an equine epizootic  [2]. Following  an  incubation  period  of  1-5  days, chills, headache, fever, body aches and prostration begin abruptly [3]. Asthenia,  dizziness  and  acute  discomfort  are  incapacitating.  Lumbosacral pain is common, along with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and a sore throat. After defervescence, a dull headache and weakness may persist for several days; fever and symptoms occasionally recrudesce. Although signs of mild neurologic involvement are common, only about 4% of infected children progress to frank neurologic disease; adults rarely do. Signs include nuchal rigidity, stupor, coma, delirium, seizures, cranial nerve palsies, motor weakness, paralysis, nystagmus, pathologic reflexes and spastic paralysis. Elevated intracranial pressure and  meningismus  occur  in  most  childhood  cases.  Approximately 0.5% of all symptomatic cases are fatal, nearly all in children. However, many survivors of neurologic disease experience sequelae, including memory problems, nervousness, asthenia, recurrent seizures, motor impairment, psychomotor retardation and behavioral disorders.\\nEastern  equine  encephalitis  typically  begins  after  3-10  days  of incubation with the sudden onset of headache, fever, chills, photophobia, dysethesias, myalgia, malaise and vomiting [1, 2, 4]. In infants, encephalitis caused by eastern equine encephalitis virus is characterized  by  abrupt  onset,  but  in  older  children  and  adults  is manifested after a few days of systemic illness. Patients may recover or  can  progress to more severe neurologic illness beginning with a worsening headache, dizziness, vomiting, lethargy and progressing to neck  stiffness,  confusion  and  convulsions.  Severe  cases  requiring hospitalization may involve seizures, disorientation and coma. The course of illness may be rapid in infants; infants are most likely to suffer neurologic sequelae,  such  as  motor  weakness, paralysis, aphasia, mental retardation and seizures.

It  may  be  fatal, especially  when  the  brainstem  is  involved  (bulbar  poliomyelitis) (Fig. 34.2.3B).\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: The clinical presentation of all forms of botulism is dominated by neurologic features resulting from the toxin-induced blockade of voluntary motor and autonomic cholinergic junctions.\\nIn adults, cranial nerve palsies are almost always the initial presenting symptoms. Extraocular muscle paresis results in blurred, or double, vision. Marked ptosis is usually evident and pupillary responses may also  be  depressed.  The  face  may  appear  expressionless  as  a  consequence  of  bilateral  facial  nerve  dysfunction.  Involvement  of  lower cranial nerves causes dysphonia, dyarthria and dysphagia. Early autonomic involvement causes anhydrosis leading affected individuals to complain  of  extremely  dry,  and  often  painful,  mouth,  tongue  and throat.\\nDisease progression manifests as a symmetrical, flaccid, descending paralysis of voluntary muscles  associated with  loss of  deep tendon reflexes. Involvement of the diaphragm and accessory thoracic muscles may result in respiratory compromise and death  unless supportive care is provided. Because of the generalized lack of motor function, respiratory failure often occurs without apparent features of respiratory distress and may be overlooked until very advanced. Significant pharyngeal muscle weakness causing airway compromise may necessitate intubation and ventilation, even in the absence of respiratory muscle weakness. Progressive autonomic involvement leads to constipation, urinary retention and hemodynamic dysregulation.\\nFever is usually absent, except in some cases of wound botulism when it probably indicates concurrent wound infection with other bacteria. Sensory nerves are unaffected by botulinum toxin. Similarly, there is no effect  on level  of  consciousness or cognitive function, although the features of expressionless facies and dysarthria are often mistaken for alcohol or drug intoxication.\\nThe extent, severity and rate of progression of clinical features vary, and not all untreated cases progress to respiratory muscle paralysis. Some  affected  individuals  only  develop  cranial  nerve  palsies  that gradually resolve without any other features of botulism becoming evident. Botulinum toxin binding is irreversible, and recovery of function depends on nerve terminal regeneration. Individuals with respiratory  compromise  typically  require  ventilatory  support  for  2-8 weeks, although, occasionally, recovery is much more protracted.\\n---\\n[PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS]\\nContent: asphyxiation.

This is based on the chronic, progressive spastic paraparesis with a thoracic sensory level in a patient from a TB-endemic region who is also HIV-positive. The diagnosis is strongly supported by the spinal radiograph showing collapse of the T11 vertebral body and a paravertebral soft tissue mass, which are characteristic findings. Schistosomiasis was ruled out with negative stool and urine tests, and the insidious onset made acute transverse myelitis less likely.\\nVitals: On a visit three months after symptom onset, his temperature was slightly elevated at 37.5 °C (99.5 °F). Upon admission to the tertiary hospital, he was afebrile with normal vital signs.\\nContent: The illness began one year prior with back pain. Over the following weeks, he developed difficulty walking and a 'pins and needles' sensation in his legs. Three months after onset, he presented to a health centre with a temperature of 37.5 °C and was given antimalarials and praziquantel. He also consulted a traditional healer. His condition progressively deteriorated over the next six months, eventually leaving him bedridden.

This is supported by the classic clinical presentation of an irreversible, acute-onset spastic paraparesis without sensory or sphincter involvement. The diagnosis is strongly corroborated by the epidemiological context: the patient's diet consisted almost exclusively of grass peas during a famine, he was a young male performing hard physical labor, and other young men in his village were similarly affected. Alternative diagnoses such as other tropical myelopathies were ruled out by the specific clinical features and exposure history.\\nContent: Ten years ago, the patient woke from sleep and noticed weakness in both legs, with no preceding trauma or prodromal symptoms. The weakness progressed rapidly over 4 to 5 days, after which he required a cane for mobility. The condition has been stable since. He reported no back pain, sensory complaints, sphincter disturbance, or upper limb symptoms.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES [4]]\\nContent: Ticks  are  picked  up  in  the  countryside  or  from  domestic  animals, particularly dogs, in the home. The majority of patients and almost all fatal cases are children. After the tick has been attached for 5-6 days, a progressive ascending, lower motor neuron paralysis develops with paraesthesiae. Often, a child, who may have been irritable for the previous 24 h, falls on getting out of bed first thing in the morning and is found to be weak or ataxic. Paralysis increases over the next few  days:  death  results  from  bulbar  and  respiratory  paralysis  and aspiration  of  stomach  contents.  Vomiting  is  a  feature  of  the  more acute course of I. holocyclus envenoming.\\nThis  clinical  picture  is  often  misinterpreted  as  poliomyelitis.  Other neurologic conditions, including Guillain-Barré syndrome, paralytic rabies, Eaton-Lambert syndrome, myasthenia gravis or botulism, may also be suspected. Diagnosis depends on finding the tick, which is likely to be concealed in a crevice, orifice or hairy area of the body. The scalp is the commonest place. Fatal tick paralysis has been caused by a tick attached to the tympanic membrane.\\n---\\n[SYMPTOMS]\\nContent: The clinical course is insidious and unpredictable. Initially, symptoms are mild or absent. As a result, patients present late (2-14 days after ingestion)  prompted  by  symptoms  of  emerging  renal  dysfunction (headache, thirst, chills, fatigue, muscle pain, lumbar and flank discomfort). Polyuria may be followed by oliguria and anuria. Pyuria is a characteristic finding. Renal function may recover completely, partially or not at all. The frequency of end-stage renal failure varies in different series of patients between 10% and 40%.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Most patients with VEE have a history of exposure to mosquitoes in regions  of  humid  tropical  forests  or  have  been  present  during  an equine epizootic  [2].

The clinical course and confirmatory laboratory test ruled out other neurological conditions considered in the differential.\\nVitals: On admission, his blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, pulse 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute, and temperature 38.5°C (101.3°F).\\nContent: A 20-year-old man presented with fever for 4 days, followed by tingling and weakness that began in his left leg and then rapidly progressed to involve all four limbs over the next 2 days. The onset of symptoms occurred about one month after a stray dog bite. After admission, he developed autonomic instability, evidenced by increased perspiration and significant variability in heart rate and blood pressure. He also developed dysphagia and respiratory distress, requiring mechanical ventilation on the third day after hospitalization. The patient died due to sudden cardiac arrest on the fifth day of hospitalization, which was nine days post-onset of symptoms.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES [4]]\\nContent: Ticks  are  picked  up  in  the  countryside  or  from  domestic  animals, particularly dogs, in the home. The majority of patients and almost all fatal cases are children. After the tick has been attached for 5-6 days, a progressive ascending, lower motor neuron paralysis develops with paraesthesiae. Often, a child, who may have been irritable for the previous 24 h, falls on getting out of bed first thing in the morning and is found to be weak or ataxic. Paralysis increases over the next few  days:  death  results  from  bulbar  and  respiratory  paralysis  and aspiration  of  stomach  contents.  Vomiting  is  a  feature  of  the  more acute course of I. holocyclus envenoming.\\nThis  clinical  picture  is  often  misinterpreted  as  poliomyelitis.  Other neurologic conditions, including Guillain-Barré syndrome, paralytic rabies, Eaton-Lambert syndrome, myasthenia gravis or botulism, may also be suspected. Diagnosis depends on finding the tick, which is likely to be concealed in a crevice, orifice or hairy area of the body. The scalp is the commonest place. Fatal tick paralysis has been caused by a tick attached to the tympanic membrane.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Amoebic liver abscess\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is an amoebic liver abscess, caused by Entamoeba histolytica. This is supported by the clinical triad of fever and tender hepatomegaly with right intercostal tenderness, imaging findings of a large solitary liver lesion with an elevated hemidiaphragm, and the aspiration of characteristic 'brownish pus'. The diagnosis was further confirmed by the patient's rapid clinical response to metronidazole therapy and the relevant epidemiological risk factor of consuming locally brewed alcohol known to be associated with amoebiasis.\\nVitals: On examination, the patient's temperature was 38.3 °C (100.8 °F), blood pressure was 100/80 mmHg, pulse was 102 bpm, and respiratory rate was 24 breath cycles per minute.\\nContent: For the past week, the patient experienced fever, chills, headache, and body aches, along with severe right-hypochondrial pain. The abdominal pain is described as constant, dull, radiating to the right shoulder, and exacerbated by coughing and resting on the right side. Over the last few days, he also developed a dry cough, has vomited twice, and has lost his appetite.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis for both patients was Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome (HCPS), caused by Andesvirus (ANDV), a New World hantavirus. This was confirmed by PCR and serology. The diagnosis was strongly supported by the patients' travel history to the Chile-Argentinian border region, which is endemic for ANDV, their outdoor activities, and the clinical presentation of acute febrile illness with progressive respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, and in the wife's case, multi-organ failure and hemorrhagic complications. Other respiratory viruses and many viral hemorrhagic fevers were ruled out by negative testing and incompatible incubation periods, leaving hantavirus as the most fitting explanation given the epidemiological context and clinical course.\\nVitals: For the husband on admission: BP 90/55 mmHg, pulse 120 beats per minute, oxygen saturation 94% on ambient air, and temperature 39°C (102.2°F). For the wife on admission (3 weeks after husband's admission): normal blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen saturation, temperature 38.6°C (101.5°F).\\nContent: The husband developed fever (39°C, 102.2°F), myalgias, and generalized weakness on the flight back to Switzerland, which did not respond to symptomatic treatment. Four days later, at presentation, he was still febrile, too weak to walk unassisted, and developed shortness of breath with oxygen desaturation and bilateral interstitial infiltrates on chest x-ray. Three weeks after her husband's admission, his wife presented with similar complaints and was admitted to the same hospital. She deteriorated rapidly within 24 hours, developing cardiorespiratory failure requiring ECMO, multi-organ failure needing hemodialysis, and profuse bleeding from puncture sites in the context of disseminated intravascular coagulation, necessitating mass transfusions.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: present  as  a  wide  variety  of  abnormalities  that  includes  dyspnea, angina, syncope, diminished heart sounds, new or altered murmurs, conductive disturbance arrhythmias, ectopic beats, a gallop rhythm, cardiac enlargement, low cardiac output or hypotension. Although up to 65% of patients have electrocardiographic (ECG) evidence of myocarditis after 1-2 weeks from onset, most are asymptomatic. Clinically significant myocarditis develops in 7-20% of patients with respiratory diphtheria compared with 0-5% with cutaneous diphtheria. Abnormalities  in  ECG  pattern,  particularly  ST-T  wave  changes  and  firstdegree  heart  block,  can  progress  to  more  severe  forms  of  block, atrioventricular dissociation and other arrhythmias that carry a poor prognosis.  Patients  with  ECG  findings  that  do  not  exceed  ectopic supraventricular beat, sinus bradycardia, prolonged P-R interval and minor T-wave changes generally do well and are associated with little, if  any,  increased  risk  of  death.  Patients  with  single  bundle  branch blocks, QRS widening, ST-T segment shifts, T wave inversions, prolonged QT wave intervals or supraventricular tachycardias are associated  with  a  10-50%  mortality.  The  fatality  rate  exceeds  90%  in patients with third-degree block, more than two ventricular premature  contractions,  ventricular  tachycardia  and  congestive  cardiac failure. Cardiac pacing appears to be of little value in patients with third-degree block. These patients have severe cardiac injury and die from congestive cardiac failure or ventricular tachycardia. Death from myocarditis  occurs  within  two  weeks  of  illness  onset.  Abatement of ECG abnormalities reflects improving cardiac function and favors survival.  Elevations  of  serum  creatine  kinase  and  serum  aspartate aminotransaminase/serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (AST/ SGOT)  concentration  closely  parallel  the  intensity  of  myocarditis and so may be used to monitor its course. Detectable cardiac injury may completely resolve over months, or even years, but some survivors are left with persistent conduction defects requiring long-term follow-up [8].\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

Infectious etiologies and rare causes of hyperthermia need to be ruled out. The differential diagnosis should include malignant hyperthermia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, endocrine and hypothalamic disorders, and fictitious hyperthermia. Heat edema and heat syncope are suggested by advanced patient age, deconditioning, low cardiac reserve and recent arrival in the tropics from cooler regions. Miliaria, a distinct heat dermatosis, is differentiated from other tropical skin maladies  by  the  timing,  distribution  and  physical  appearance  of  skin vesicles.  Miliaria  responds  promptly  to  antihistamines  or  dilute topical chlorhexidine. Heat cramps are a second common malady in unacclimatized individuals;  diagnosis  is  suggested  by  resolution  of cramps with rest and cool treatment, stretching and fluids, and electrolyte  repletion.  The  two  most  dangerous  heat  illnesses  -  heat exhaustion and heat stroke - have overlapping clinical features and are discussed in greater detail below.\\n---\\n[PHYSICAL EXAM]\\nDisease: Cholera\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is cholera, caused by Vibrio cholerae O1, Serotype Ogawa, biotype El Tor. This was established based on the classic clinical syndrome of profuse rice-water diarrhea leading to severe dehydration and shock, combined with a clear epidemiological link to a contaminated water source during an outbreak. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by stool microscopy showing characteristic motile bacilli inhibited by specific antiserum and by positive stool culture for V. cholerae.\\nVitals: On admission, the patient was afebrile with a pulse rate of 110 bpm (low volume) and a blood pressure of 90/50 mmHg. After initial intravenous rehydration, her pulse rate improved to 84 bpm and her blood pressure rose to 100/70 mmHg.\\nContent: On examination, the patient was stuporous and responded minimally to painful stimuli (GCS 9/15). She exhibited clear signs of severe dehydration, including sunken eyes, a dry mouth, a scaphoid abdomen, and very slow skin turgor recoil. The remainder of her systemic examination was normal.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Stevens-Johnson syndrome\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), a severe drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction. This clinical diagnosis is based on the patient's generalized maculopapular rash with extensive mucous membrane involvement (oral, conjunctival, genital), which appeared approximately four weeks after starting nevirapine and co-trimoxazole, both of which are highly implicated drugs. The diagnosis is further supported by the much higher incidence of SJS in HIV-positive individuals. Infectious causes like malaria were ruled out with negative testing.\\nVitals: Temperature is 37.7°C (99.9°F), blood pressure is 120/68 mmHg, pulse is 90 bpm, and respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute.\\nContent: The patient developed a productive cough with whitish sputum, followed one day later by a generalized skin rash that started on her trunk and spread to the extremities and mucosal membranes. Over the past two days, she also developed a sore throat and dysuria. The rash involves her lips, oral mucosa, conjunctivae, and genital mucosa, and has made talking and eating difficult and painful.\\n---\\n[MODERATE CASES:]\\nContent: Add basic blood chemistries; test for sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine.\\nSevere cases (e.g. CNS disturbances):\\nAdd aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine aminiotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), uric acid, calcium, phosphate, coagulation studies (PT and PTT, Ebrinogen); consider arterial blood gas for accurate determination of physiologic pH.\\nHeat exhaustion is an imprecise clinical syndrome characterized by nonspecific findings unified under a history of heat exposure. Core body temperature for heat exhaustion is < 40°C. Common symptoms include  nausea  and  vomiting,  headache  and weakness.  Respiratory rate  may  be  elevated.  The  cardiac  and  pulmonary  exam  may  be normal; however, tachycardia may be present from concomitant dehydration. The presence of sweating in heat exhaustion patients is an important finding as it is frequently  absent in heat stroke patients. The  patient's  mental  status  may  suggest  mild  confusion  and  complaints may include dizziness. Symptoms of heat exhaustion tend to resolve with any modest interventions that lower body temperature.\\nHeat  stroke  is  a  life-threatening  condition  defined  by  a  core  body temperature > 40°C and mental status or neurologic symptoms that do not respond to initial therapy (rest, cold treatment and hydration) [13]. Patients may be combative, with delirium, seizure, obtundation or coma. Clues to differentiate early heat stroke from heat exhaustion include significant  mental  status  changes,  diarrhea  and  dry  skin  in heat  stroke.  A  minority  of  heat  stroke  casualties  may  present  with sweating; however, this usually stops as thermoregulation continues to fail. Complications of heat stroke include acute renal failure from rhabdomyolysis, liver failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), seizure, coma and death [1].

What is the most likely diagnosis?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[CUTANEOUS ULCER]\\nContent: Beside pyodermas, the main cause of cutaneous ulcer  is cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) (Fig. 147.9). Old World CL (caused primarily by Leishmania  major and L.  tropica )  usually  occurs  in  travelers  to  subSaharan and North Africa, the Mediterranean basin, and the Middle East. New World CL (caused primarily by species of L. braziliensis and L. mexicana complexes) usually occurs in travelers to the forested areas of South and Central America. The clinical forms of CL also include papules, nodules, plaques and nodular lymphangitis [4]. The average number  of  cutaneous  lesions  varies  from  one  to  three  and  rarely exceeds ten per patient. Usual features of CL include return from an endemic country in  the New  or Old  World,  anatomic  location  on exposed skin (face, arms, legs), absence of pain, chronicity (more than\\n1 month duration), and failure of antibiotic treatment (which is often prescribed to treat 'pyoderma').\\nOther causes of cutaneous ulcer in returned travelers include inoculation eschars seen during rickettsioses (e.g. African tick bite fever) (Fig. 147.10),  the  early  stage  of  African  trypanosomiasis  (trypanosomal chancre) (Fig. 147.1 1), and less commonly, cutaneous anthrax.

This was confirmed by multiple laboratory findings: blood cultures grew gram-positive rods, a skin biopsy demonstrated abundant bacilli positive for B. anthracis antigens by immunohistochemistry, and convalescent serology was positive for antibodies to protective antigen. The diagnosis was supported by the epidemiological context of his occupation as a postal worker handling contaminated mail during a bioterrorism event.\\nVitals: On examination, his temperature was 36.9 °C (98.4 °F), pulse was 118 bpm, blood pressure was 138/90mmHg, and respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute.\\nContent: The differential diagnosis for the ulcerative skin lesion with massive swelling included bacterial ecthyma (Streptococcus, Staphylococcus), rickettsial diseases, necrotic arachnidism, rat-bite fevers, ulceroglandular tularemia, and bubonic plague. However, given the ongoing investigation of a possible bioterrorism event in the United States, cutaneous anthrax was considered the most important diagnosis to rule in.\\n---\\n[PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS]\\nContent: The chance of acquiring O. volvulus infection  increases with  greater exposure time in endemic regions (Box 1 12.1). Some patients may be diagnosed through investigation of eosinophilia. A presumptive diagnosis can be made based on a history of exposure in an endemic area,  the  presence of subcutaneous  nodules,  or typical  skin  and/or ocular signs. Early onchodermatitis is rarely diagnosed correctly and must be distinguished from atopic dermatitis, food allergies, contact dermatitis, insect bites and scabies. Chronic skin lesions can be mistaken  for  severe  chronic  eczema,  malnutrition  and  presbydermia. 'Leopard skin' must be distinguished from other causes of hypochromia, including vitiligo and leprosy.\\nDefinitive diagnosis depends on the identification of microfilariae in skin snips or of the adult worms from excised or aspirated nodules [10]. Ocular microfilariae can be detected by slit lamp examination. The chances of detection are increased if patients are asked to sit with their head between their legs for up to 10 minutes prior to examination. Microfilariae in the anterior chamber are seen as small wriggling worms. Live microfilariae in the cornea are transparent and coiled up. Skin snips can be obtained using a corneoscleral punch (Fig. 1 12.9A) or by elevating a crease of skin with the point of a needle (Fig. 1 12.9B) and  obtaining  a  small  circular  disc-shaped  slice  of  epidermis  and superficial dermis using a scalpel blade. The skin snip is then incubated  on  a  glass  slide  in  saline  and  examined  using  a  dissecting microscope  (or  magnifying  glass)  to  detect  emergent  microfilariae [10].\\nAssays to detect specific antibodies to Onchocerca [1 1-14]  and PCR [15]  to  detect  onchocercal  DNA  in  skin  snips  are  now  in  use  in\\nFIGURE  112.9 Sampling  of  skin  for  diagnosis  of O.  volvulus infection.

He works in construction with frequent dust exposure and reports no recent travel outside the region. Chest imaging shows \\npneumonia-like changes. What is the most likely diagnosis?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[PNEUMONIA]\\nContent: Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common bacterial cause of pneumonia. Upper  respiratory  involvement  often  precedes  the  onset  of pneumococcal  pneumonia,  which  is  characterized  by  fever,  chills, malaise and sweating. The patient is flushed and febrile with a rapid pulse and respiratory rate. Dyspnea is associated with a nonproductive cough, and sputum, if present, may be thick, tenacious or 'rusty' . Severe pleuritic chest pain causing tachypnea and grunting respiration is often present. Such symptoms are abrupt in young, immunocompetent patients (Fig.1.1) [6].\\nIn elderly patients, symptoms may be few and can be dominated by confusion, delirium and prostration [7]. Physical examination of the affected lung, usually the lower lobe, reveals diminished lung expansion, impaired percussion note, decreased breath sounds, crepitations (crackles/rales)  and  bronchial  breath  sounds.  Cyanosis  is  common and a herpes simplex eruption may be seen on the lips. With proper treatment,  most  patients  with  pneumococcal  pneumonia  improve clinically  and  radiographically  within  1-2  weeks.  When  resolution occurs, fever subsides within a week as the temperature decreases following  a  crisis  pattern  (Fig.  1.2A).  Delayed  resolution  is  seen  in smokers, the elderly,  and in  those with poor nutrition,  diabetes  or other comorbid illnesses.\\nStaphylococcal  pneumonia  ( Staphylococcus aureus ), accounts for 2-10% of acute community-acquired pneumonias. It is an important cause of pneumonia in children, the elderly, patients recovering from influenza, people with diabetes mellitus, and those who are immunocompromised.  Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus  aureus (MRSA) causes illness in 1% of cases of upper or lower respiratory tract infection in the community and in 10% of patients who are hospitalized. Patients  with  staphylococcal  pneumonia  are  usually  ill  with  high fever, shaking chills, chest pain, cough and purulent sputum. Chest x-ray films show patchy consolidation and cavities.\\n---\\n[LUNG DISEASE]\\nContent: Cryptococcal pneumonia is not distinctive clinically [15]. The presence  of Cryptococcus spp.  in  a  respiratory  specimen  should  prompt investigation for dissemination and meningoencephalitis. Symptoms are low-grade fever, dull chest pain, and dry cough. Focal infiltrates are  common;  cavitation  and  pleural  effusion  rare.  Asymptomatic pneumonia or enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes can be detected in previously  healthy  individuals.  Diagnosis  of  lung  colonization  can only  be  made  in  immunocompetent  individuals  if  cryptococcal disease has been ruled out (negative antigen detection and negative blood, urine and CSF cultures).\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Tuberculous Lymphadenitis with Paradoxical IRIS\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was tuberculous lymphadenitis with superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis, complicated by paradoxical immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). The initial diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis was confirmed by an AFB-positive fine-needle aspirate from a neck gland. The paradoxical IRIS was diagnosed clinically based on his worsening condition after starting ART, despite evidence of a good virologic and immunologic response. The superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis, likely with Staphylococcus aureus, was confirmed by the second aspirate showing purulent material with coccoid bacteria and the patient's rapid improvement following incision, drainage, and antibiotics.\\nVitals: On presentation, he was febrile with a temperature of 39.2 °C (102.56° F).

In studies  of  community-acquired  pneumonia  in  Arizona,  serologic studies demonstrated that coccidioidomycosis is the etiology in 15% of patients [5].\\nTypically,  the  symptoms  of  acute  pulmonary  coccidioidomycosis resolve  spontaneously  in  less  than  a  month.  Alternatively,  the pulmonary infiltrates  may  condense  into  nodules  that may resolve or  persist  asymptomatically.  While  primary  pneumonia  usually resolves, in  5-19%  of patients, the  disease may  linger for  months, with chronic pulmonary infiltrates, cough and pleuritic  chest pain. Pulmonary  infiltrates  can  also  undergo  cavitation.  Cavitary  disease can be asymptomatic or cause chronic productive cough and occasional hemoptysis, or rupture into the pleura [2]. Cavities may also develop  secondary  bacterial  or Aspergillus (fungus  ball)  infection. Small cavities ( < 5 cm diameter) are more likely to resolve spontaneously than large ones. Chronic pulmonary coccidioidomycosis may follow an intermittent waxing and waning course or be slowly progressive over years [6].\\nUncommonly,  patients  have  fulminating  pneumonia,  with  diffuse reticulonodular infiltrates, fever, and hypoxia (Fig. 81.3). Aggressive pulmonary disease can occur in pregnancy, especially the last trimester,  and  in  other  immunosuppressive  conditions,  such  as  AIDS, or treatment with corticosteroids or tumor necrosis factor-alpha antagonists [6].\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Paracoccidioidomycosis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is chronic (adult) paracoccidioidomycosis caused by the fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. This was definitively confirmed by direct microscopic visualization of the characteristic budding yeast forms in a KOH preparation of the patient's sputum, and subsequently by a positive fungal culture. The diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's demographic profile (male farmer from an endemic area in Peru), chronic pulmonary symptoms, significant weight loss, and failure to respond to empirical anti-tuberculosis therapy.\\nVitals: Temperature 37.2 °C (98.9 °F), blood pressure 120/75 mmHg, pulse 70 bpm regular, and respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute.\\nContent: For four months, the patient experienced a chronic productive cough, chest pain, dyspnoea on exertion, and a weight loss of about 20 kg. He denied diarrhoea, fever, or night sweats. Three and a half months earlier, he was hospitalized and diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis based on clinical presentation and an abnormal chest radiograph, despite three negative sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli. Despite adherence to first-line TB therapy (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol) for several months, he showed no clinical improvement, with persistence of his productive cough which later included streaking of blood in the sputum. This prompted his referral with a suspected diagnosis of multi-drug resistant TB.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

The initial diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis was confirmed by an AFB-positive fine-needle aspirate from a neck gland. The paradoxical IRIS was diagnosed clinically based on his worsening condition after starting ART, despite evidence of a good virologic and immunologic response. The superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis, likely with Staphylococcus aureus, was confirmed by the second aspirate showing purulent material with coccoid bacteria and the patient's rapid improvement following incision, drainage, and antibiotics.\\nVitals: On presentation, he was febrile with a temperature of 39.2 °C (102.56° F). His pulse was 112 bpm, respiratory rate was 28 breaths per minute, and he had a normal blood pressure.\\nContent: For six weeks, the patient has experienced a productive cough and chest pain, associated with systemic symptoms including weight loss, fevers, and night sweats. During this period, he also developed a painful swelling in his neck. He has no other reported symptoms.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Lassa fever\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is Lassa fever, caused by Lassa virus. This was confirmed by a positive antigen test. The diagnosis was supported by the clinical syndrome of severe febrile illness with pharyngitis, conjunctivitis, pneumonitis, renal impairment, and elevated transaminases that was refractory to antibiotics and antimalarials. The patient's location in eastern Sierra Leone, a known endemic area, provided strong epidemiological evidence.\\nVitals: On examination after deteriorating, her axillary temperature was 38.2 °C (100.8 °F), blood pressure was 80/55 mmHg, and pulse rate was 100 bpm.\\nContent: The patient presented with a 6-day history of fever, weakness, sore throat, and retrosternal chest pain, with loose stools for the past 2 days. She was seen at a local health post and treated with artemether/amodiaquine and amoxicillin but continued to worsen. After admission to a rural hospital, she received IV ceftriaxone but her condition deteriorated over the next two days. On the second day after admission, she developed conjunctivitis, cough, and breathlessness, and became unable to walk unaided.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Visceral leishmaniasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar), caused by a Leishmania protozoan. This diagnosis is supported by the patient's presentation with chronic undulating fever, severe malnutrition, splenomegaly, generalized lymphadenopathy, and pancytopenia. Epidemiological risk was high, as she was from a known endemic area with a family history of the disease. Although an initial rK39 RDT was negative, the diagnosis was confirmed by a positive Direct Agglutination Test (DAT) with a high titre of 1:6400 and a definitive clinical response to treatment with liposomal amphotericin B.\\nVitals: On presentation, her vital signs were: temperature 39.6°C (103.3°F), pulse 96 bpm, and blood pressure 100/60 mmHg.\\nContent: For the past four weeks, the patient has experienced an undulating fever, occurring mainly in the afternoon, accompanied by chills and occasional convulsions. Initially, she was well between febrile episodes and played normally. However, over time she has developed progressive anorexia, a dry cough, chest pain, and joint and back pain.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Severe Fever With Thrombocytopenia Syndrome\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (SFTS), caused by the SFTS virus. This diagnosis was definitively confirmed by a positive SFTS virus PCR in blood serum. Clinical presentation included acute fever, joint pain, headache, nausea, drowsiness, impaired consciousness, and respiratory distress, supported by laboratory findings of thrombocytopenia, elevated AST/ALT, LDH, and CK, alongside a negative CRP. The epidemiological context of living in southwestern Japan with potential wild animal and tick exposure further supported the diagnosis, while bacterial sepsis was ruled out after negative SFTS PCR results and no bacterial infection was identified.\\nVitals: On examination, his body temperature was 37 °C (98.6 °F), pulse rate 101 bpm, blood pressure 120/70 mmHg, SpO2 96% with 7l oxygen, and respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute. His Glasgow Coma Scale on arrival was 13/15 (E3V4M6).\\nContent: The patient presented with a 5-day history of fever, joint pain, headache, and nausea. Upon admission, he was unwell and drowsy, with signs of impaired consciousness and respiratory distress. His symptoms suggested sepsis, progressing to respiratory failure requiring intubation and protracted hypotension.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis for both patients was Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome (HCPS), caused by Andesvirus (ANDV), a New World hantavirus. This was confirmed by PCR and serology. The diagnosis was strongly supported by the patients' travel history to the Chile-Argentinian border region, which is endemic for ANDV, their outdoor activities, and the clinical presentation of acute febrile illness with progressive respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, and in the wife's case, multi-organ failure and hemorrhagic complications. Other respiratory viruses and many viral hemorrhagic fevers were ruled out by negative testing and incompatible incubation periods, leaving hantavirus as the most fitting explanation given the epidemiological context and clinical course.\\nVitals: For the husband on admission: BP 90/55 mmHg, pulse 120 beats per minute, oxygen saturation 94% on ambient air, and temperature 39°C (102.2°F).

Four days later, at presentation, he was still febrile, too weak to walk unassisted, and developed shortness of breath with oxygen desaturation and bilateral interstitial infiltrates on chest x-ray. Three weeks after her husband's admission, his wife presented with similar complaints and was admitted to the same hospital. She deteriorated rapidly within 24 hours, developing cardiorespiratory failure requiring ECMO, multi-organ failure needing hemodialysis, and profuse bleeding from puncture sites in the context of disseminated intravascular coagulation, necessitating mass transfusions.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

This was confirmed by direct microscopic identification of Giardia trophozoites and cysts in stool samples. The clinical presentation of greasy, foul-smelling stools, bloating, and evidence of carbohydrate malabsorption (positive reducing substances in stool) is classic for this infection.\\nVitals: The patient has no fever; no other vital signs are reported.\\nContent: For the past two weeks, the patient has experienced four to five episodes of loose stools per day, accompanied by weight loss, anorexia, malaise, flatulence, and abdominal cramping during defecation. For the last three days, he has noted bloating and distension after consuming milk products. While he has mild nausea, he reports no fever. His stools were initially watery, but after a 5-day course of ciprofloxacin from a local pharmacy (which ended two days ago), they are now three to four per day and described as mushy, greasy, and foul-smelling.\\n---\\n[ASSESSMENT]\\nContent: The goals in assessing patients are to:\\n- determine if there is a persisting, treatable infection-often giardiasis or another protozoal infection;\\n- consider the possibility of gastrointestinal disease, such as celiac disease, brought to light as a consequence of intestinal infection, or IBD presenting for the first time;\\n- consider whether the patient has a disease unrelated to travel.\\nIf, after careful evaluation, an infectious cause is ruled out and there is no underlying non-infectious bowel disease, the patient is likely to have post-infectious IBS. In this case, managing persisting symptoms becomes the main objective.\\nWeight  loss  during  tropical  travels  is  common,  but  this  is  usually regained when the traveler returns to their usual diet. When this does not happen, malabsorption needs to be considered in a patient with continuing diarrhea. Pale, foul-smelling stools are typical of malabsorption. Both foul-smelling flatus and stools are typical of giardiasis. Soreness of tongue or mouth can be associated with folate deficiency, consistent with celiac disease and tropical sprue, but uncommon in giardiasis.  Tropical  sprue  is  now  uncommon  in  travellers,  perhaps related  to  the ready  use  of antibiotics  in  the treatment of travelers' diarrhea.\\nPhysical  examination  should  assess  for  abdominal  masses,  colonic tenderness,  and  organ  enlargement.  Signs  of  advanced  nutrient depletion such as glossitis, anemia, and ankle edema suggesting hypoproteinemia,  are  unusual.  It  is  essential  to  record  body  weight  at initial evaluation so that changes over time and after treatment can be monitored.\\nA history of blood in the stools needs careful evaluation. The cause may be as simple as an anal fissure from frequent bowel movements and irritation at the mucocutaneous junction, or bleeding from hemorrhoids. In these cases, small amounts of fresh blood are seen on the outside of the stool or left on the toilet paper after a bowel movement. Blood can be associated with invasive organisms, shiga-toxin producing E. coli [9], and non-infectious etiologies (Table 146-1).

Intestinal tapeworm infection typically causes mild or absent symptoms, but may include abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, increased appetite or food cravings, gas, \\nand weight loss. Symptoms depend on the species and worm burden. In contrast, larval cyst infection occurs when larvae migrate and form cysts in tissues.

Treatment is primarily by oral rehydration using Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) (see Box 18.7).\\n---\\n[CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS]\\nContent: The onset of symptoms can vary from a few hours after ingesting food containing preformed toxins, to several days after ingesting bacterial pathogens, to two or more weeks in parasitic infections. Acute infectious  diarrhea  can  be  classified  into  watery  diarrhea  and  bloody diarrhea (dysentery) (Box 3.1). Noninfectious causes of acute diarrhea are less significant in the tropics, but causes that should be considered include toxin-induced (e.g. organophosphate poisoning), medicationrelated and ischemic colitis.

All children with watery diarrhea should be assumed to have dehydration  and  given  ReSoMal,  a  special  rehydration  solution for children with SAM. It contains less sodium and more potassium and  glucose  than  the  standard  oral  rehydration  solution  (ORS) (Box 138.2).\\nIf  diarrhea  is  severe,  then  the  standard  hypo-osmolar  WHO-ORS (75 mmol sodium/l) may be used as loss of sodium in stool is high and  symptomatic  hyponatremia  can  occur  with  ReSoMal.  Severe diarrhea can be caused by cholera or rotavirus infection, and is usually defined as stool output > 5 ml/kg/hr.\\nReturn  of  tears,  moist  mouth,  eyes  and  fontanelle  appearing  less sunken, and improved skin turgor are signs that rehydration is proceeding. It should be noted that many severely malnourished children will  not  show  these  changes,  even  when  fully  rehydrated.  Signs  of over-hydration are increasing respiratory rate and pulse rate, increasing edema and puffy eyelids. If these signs occur, fluids are stopped immediately and the child reassessed after one hour. IV rehydration should be used only in case of shock, infusing slowly to avoid overloading the heart.\\n---\\n[INTRODUCTION]\\nContent: Acute diarrhea is the cardinal symptom of viral gastrointestinal infection and is defined as the passage of three or more watery or looserthan-usual stools within the preceding 24 hours for less than 2 weeks' duration.  Globally,  diarrhea  is  the  second  most  common  cause  of death (18%, 10.8 million) in children younger than 5 years of age and it causes more deaths in this age group than HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria put altogether (Fig. 30.1). Viruses account for the major proportion of causative agents responsible for acute gastroenteritis both in developing and developed countries.\\nViral  gastroenteritis  generally  presents  a  similar  clinical  picturewhatever the virus-requiring laboratory investigation for establishing its  etiology.  Signs and  symptoms  of typical acute viral gastroenteritis include acute onset of diarrhea, often with preceding vomiting, and sometimes with fever and abdominal pain. The most important complication  is  dehydration  and  this  requires  oral or intravenous fluid replacement therapy depending on the degree of dehydration. The disease typically lasts  3-5  days  and  is  self-limiting.  The viruses  are transmitted  feco-orally  and  infect  the  epithelial  cells  of  the  small intestine.  Damage  to  the  villous  epithelium  of  the  small  intestine affects the absorption of fluid and causes watery diarrhea. No inflammation occurs as the viruses only multiply within the enterocytes in the intestinal epithelium and do not spread into the submucosa.\\nFIGURE  30.1 Leading  causes  of  death  in  the  world  from  infectious diseases in 2008 (adapted with permission from http://www.who.int/infectiousdisease-report/pages/graph5.html).\\nFIGURE  30.2 Negative-stain  electron  micrograph  of  rotavirus  particles. The bar represents 100 nm (courtesy of Brian Getty, University of Liverpool).\\n---\\n[COMPLICATIONS]\\nContent: The leading cause of death in patients with acute diarrhea is dehydration, which requires prompt fluid and electrolyte replacement. The nutritional state of children  often  deteriorates  because of anorexia, nutrient malabsorption, and the practice of not feeding children who have diarrhea. Hypolactasia is a sequela of many gut infections and may cause persistent diarrhea. Dysentery can be associated with severe local complications such as hemorrhage, toxic megacolon and bowel\\nperforation.  In  addition,  invasive  organisms  can  result  in  systemic manifestations  including  hemolytic  uremic  syndrome  (which  can complicate Shigella dysenteriae and E.  coli O157 infections), reactive arthritis  (following  shigellosis,  salmonellosis,  campylobacteriosis, yersiniosis, and Clostridium difficile infection) and Guillain-Barré syndrome (campylobacteriosis).\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

Rotavirus infection typically begins with vomiting and fever, which \\noften improve within the first 1–2 days, followed by watery diarrhea that can last several days to a week. Stool patterns may take weeks to fully normalize. In adults, infection is often \\nasymptomatic or mild, but in young children it can lead to significant dehydration, especially if fluid intake is reduced. Rotavirus is caused by the rotavirus, which infects the gastrointestinal \\ntract. Transmission occurs via the fecal–oral route, as the virus is shed in stool beginning up to two days before symptoms appear and for up to 10 days afterward. The virus spreads easily \\nthrough contaminated hands, surfaces, toys, doorknobs, and toilet handles, and is transferred to the mouth through hand-to-mouth contact. Risk factors include age under 5 years, with the \\nhighest risk of severe disease in children under 3 years old, attendance at childcare centers or pediatric hospital settings, close contact with infected individuals, and seasonal exposure \\n(higher incidence in winter and spring in temperate climates).

Toxin-induced  secretory  diarrhea  continues  independent  of  food intake. Malabsorption of carbohydrate in the small intestine leads to fermentation of unabsorbed substrates by colonic bacteria; this may cause bloating, the passage of much rectal gas and frothy stools, which are all characteristic of giardiasis. Cryptosporidiosis can involve both small and large bowel, causing short-lived and self-limiting diarrhea; however, the infection can be prolonged in patients with impaired immune responses. Cyclospora cayetanensis can also cause  acute and more chronic diarrhea with abnormalities of intestinal absorption.\\nFrequent  bowel  movements  with  small  volumes  of  stool  and  the passage  of  blood  and  mucus  suggest  colonic  infection.  Causes  of bloody diarrhea (dysentery) include invasive bacteria such as Campylobacter spp., enterohemorrhagic E. coli , and Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia spp.; nonbacterial causes include Entamoeba histolytica (amebic dysentery) and Balantidium coli , which is spread by close contact with pigs. Colicky abdominal pain is common in many gut infections and is especially severe in campylobacteriosis and yersiniosis, mimicking acute appendicitis. Fever, chills and generalized myalgia are usually associated with infection by invasive organisms; these patients appear ill and have generalized abdominal tenderness.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Cholera\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is cholera, caused by Vibrio cholerae O1, Serotype Ogawa, biotype El Tor. This was established based on the classic clinical syndrome of profuse rice-water diarrhea leading to severe dehydration and shock, combined with a clear epidemiological link to a contaminated water source during an outbreak. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by stool microscopy showing characteristic motile bacilli inhibited by specific antiserum and by positive stool culture for V. cholerae.\\nVitals: On admission, the patient was afebrile with a pulse rate of 110 bpm (low volume) and a blood pressure of 90/50 mmHg. After initial intravenous rehydration, her pulse rate improved to 84 bpm and her blood pressure rose to 100/70 mmHg.\\nContent: The patient developed profuse, large-volume watery diarrhoea, passing 12 to 15 stools in the past day. The stools were described as resembling diluted milk or rice water with white flakes. The illness was notable for the absence of abdominal pain or fever. Approximately one hour prior to presentation, she became unresponsive, prompting her husband to bring her to the hospital.\\n---\\n[SYMPTOMS]\\nContent: Intense gastrointestinal symptoms  will  follow ingestion within 30 min  to  a  few  hours.

The diagnosis aligns with the patient's travel history to the Amazon Basin, the preceding dengue-like febrile illness, and the characteristic prolonged symmetrical polyarthralgias primarily affecting small peripheral joints, while other common travel-related viral and bacterial causes were ruled out by serology.\\nVitals: No specific vital signs were reported other than the occurrence of an acute febrile illness with chills.\\nContent: During the second week of a 3.5-week trip to the Amazon Basin of northern Peru, the patient developed an acute febrile illness with chills, malaise, frontal headache, generalized myalgia, and a transient, non-pruritic maculopapular rash. The rash began on the forearms about 1 week after fever onset, spread to the trunk, neck, and face, and faded after 3 days. Slowly progressive, debilitating polyarthralgias affecting peripheral joints, with transient joint swelling, also developed. Painful cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy lasted for about 1 week. Fever and other acute symptoms subsided within 1 week, but polyarthralgias persisted, showing a symmetrical pattern mainly affecting the small joints of the hands and feet, wrists, ankles, and knees. Upon return to Switzerland a few weeks later, the patient reported stiffness of the affected joints, mainly in the morning and after immobility, and the joint pains did not improve for two more months.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: African tick-bite fever\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is African tick-bite fever, caused by Rickettsia africae.

The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by a positive Marburg virus PCR result. A co-infection with Plasmodium falciparum was also diagnosed but was considered less likely to be the cause of her severe presentation given the low parasitaemia and high local prevalence.\\nVitals: On presentation, her blood pressure was 85/65 mmHg, pulse rate was 105 bpm, and temperature was 38 °C (100.4 °F).\\nContent: The illness began 5 days prior with fever, a sore throat, and generalized aching.

His blood pressure was 120/70 mmHg, pulse was 100 bpm, and respiratory rate was 26 breaths per minute. He was hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 87% on room air, which improved to 97% on 15L of oxygen.\\nContent: The patient presented with a 6-week history of progressively worsening shortness of breath, a dry cough, and drenching night sweats. He also reported general fatigue and a significant weight loss of approximately 10 kg over the past 5 months.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Severe Fever With Thrombocytopenia Syndrome\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (SFTS), caused by the SFTS virus. This diagnosis was definitively confirmed by a positive SFTS virus PCR in blood serum. Clinical presentation included acute fever, joint pain, headache, nausea, drowsiness, impaired consciousness, and respiratory distress, supported by laboratory findings of thrombocytopenia, elevated AST/ALT, LDH, and CK, alongside a negative CRP. The epidemiological context of living in southwestern Japan with potential wild animal and tick exposure further supported the diagnosis, while bacterial sepsis was ruled out after negative SFTS PCR results and no bacterial infection was identified.\\nVitals: On examination, his body temperature was 37 °C (98.6 °F), pulse rate 101 bpm, blood pressure 120/70 mmHg, SpO2 96% with 7l oxygen, and respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute. His Glasgow Coma Scale on arrival was 13/15 (E3V4M6).\\nContent: The patient presented with a 5-day history of fever, joint pain, headache, and nausea. Upon admission, he was unwell and drowsy, with signs of impaired consciousness and respiratory distress. His symptoms suggested sepsis, progressing to respiratory failure requiring intubation and protracted hypotension.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis for both patients was Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome (HCPS), caused by Andesvirus (ANDV), a New World hantavirus. This was confirmed by PCR and serology. The diagnosis was strongly supported by the patients' travel history to the Chile-Argentinian border region, which is endemic for ANDV, their outdoor activities, and the clinical presentation of acute febrile illness with progressive respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, and in the wife's case, multi-organ failure and hemorrhagic complications. Other respiratory viruses and many viral hemorrhagic fevers were ruled out by negative testing and incompatible incubation periods, leaving hantavirus as the most fitting explanation given the epidemiological context and clinical course.\\nVitals: For the husband on admission: BP 90/55 mmHg, pulse 120 beats per minute, oxygen saturation 94% on ambient air, and temperature 39°C (102.2°F). For the wife on admission (3 weeks after husband's admission): normal blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen saturation, temperature 38.6°C (101.5°F).\\nContent: The husband developed fever (39°C, 102.2°F), myalgias, and generalized weakness on the flight back to Switzerland, which did not respond to symptomatic treatment. Four days later, at presentation, he was still febrile, too weak to walk unassisted, and developed shortness of breath with oxygen desaturation and bilateral interstitial infiltrates on chest x-ray. Three weeks after her husband's admission, his wife presented with similar complaints and was admitted to the same hospital. She deteriorated rapidly within 24 hours, developing cardiorespiratory failure requiring ECMO, multi-organ failure needing hemodialysis, and profuse bleeding from puncture sites in the context of disseminated intravascular coagulation, necessitating mass transfusions.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Amoebic liver abscess\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is an amoebic liver abscess, caused by Entamoeba histolytica. This is supported by the clinical triad of fever and tender hepatomegaly with right intercostal tenderness, imaging findings of a large solitary liver lesion with an elevated hemidiaphragm, and the aspiration of characteristic 'brownish pus'. The diagnosis was further confirmed by the patient's rapid clinical response to metronidazole therapy and the relevant epidemiological risk factor of consuming locally brewed alcohol known to be associated with amoebiasis.\\nVitals: On examination, the patient's temperature was 38.3 °C (100.8 °F), blood pressure was 100/80 mmHg, pulse was 102 bpm, and respiratory rate was 24 breath cycles per minute.\\nContent: For the past week, the patient experienced fever, chills, headache, and body aches, along with severe right-hypochondrial pain. The abdominal pain is described as constant, dull, radiating to the right shoulder, and exacerbated by coughing and resting on the right side.

What could be causing these symptoms and their prolonged duration?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Tuberculous Lymphadenitis with Paradoxical IRIS\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was tuberculous lymphadenitis with superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis, complicated by paradoxical immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). The initial diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis was confirmed by an AFB-positive fine-needle aspirate from a neck gland. The paradoxical IRIS was diagnosed clinically based on his worsening condition after starting ART, despite evidence of a good virologic and immunologic response. The superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis, likely with Staphylococcus aureus, was confirmed by the second aspirate showing purulent material with coccoid bacteria and the patient's rapid improvement following incision, drainage, and antibiotics.\\nVitals: On presentation, he was febrile with a temperature of 39.2 °C (102.56° F). His pulse was 112 bpm, respiratory rate was 28 breaths per minute, and he had a normal blood pressure.\\nContent: For six weeks, the patient has experienced a productive cough and chest pain, associated with systemic symptoms including weight loss, fevers, and night sweats. During this period, he also developed a painful swelling in his neck. He has no other reported symptoms.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Stevens-Johnson syndrome\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), a severe drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction. This clinical diagnosis is based on the patient's generalized maculopapular rash with extensive mucous membrane involvement (oral, conjunctival, genital), which appeared approximately four weeks after starting nevirapine and co-trimoxazole, both of which are highly implicated drugs. The diagnosis is further supported by the much higher incidence of SJS in HIV-positive individuals. Infectious causes like malaria were ruled out with negative testing.\\nVitals: Temperature is 37.7°C (99.9°F), blood pressure is 120/68 mmHg, pulse is 90 bpm, and respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute.\\nContent: The patient developed a productive cough with whitish sputum, followed one day later by a generalized skin rash that started on her trunk and spread to the extremities and mucosal membranes. Over the past two days, she also developed a sore throat and dysuria. The rash involves her lips, oral mucosa, conjunctivae, and genital mucosa, and has made talking and eating difficult and painful.\\n---\\n[FEVER]\\nContent: Prolonged fever is common, especially among patients with low CD4 cell counts (e.g. < 200 cells/ml) who are not receiving ART [151], and differential  diagnosis  is  broad  and  varies  geographically.  Infectious etiologies are responsible for the majority of fevers.\\nTuberculosis should be considered in all patients with fever especially if cough, shortness of breath, weight loss, night sweats, or lymphadenopathy are present (see Chapter 39, ' Tuberculosis ') [131]. Other causes of fever are cryptococcal disease (e.g. C. neoformans bloodstream infection),  bacteremia  (e.g. Salmonella , Rhodococcus ),  pneumonia,  both bacterial (e.g. S.  pneumoniae )  and  fungal (e.g. PCP), malaria, CMV, and lymphoma. Multiple concurrent etiologies occur.\\nThe  diagnostic  work-up  for  fever  should  be  driven  by  the  clinical presentation and availability of diagnostic tests. Blood cultures, blood smear for malaria, mycobacterial blood cultures and serum cryptococcal antigen testing can be helpful. Chest radiography, urine culture, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, and other radiologic studies (e.g. brain imaging, abdominal imaging) may be necessary. Certain etiologies such as mycobacterial disease, Pneumocystis , Bartonella , lymphoma and certain fungal infections can be particularly difficult to diagnose and  should  be  considered  when  fever  persists  despite  a  diagnostic work-up.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Histoplasmosis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is disseminated histoplasmosis caused by the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. This was confirmed by the identification of the organism in a submandibular lymph node biopsy via both PCR and subsequent culture. The clinical presentation of disseminated abscesses, osteomyelitis, and generalized lymphadenopathy, along with the patient's travel history to an endemic region in northern Thailand, supported the diagnosis. The dramatic clinical and laboratory response to specific antifungal therapy further confirmed the etiology.\\nVitals: On admission, the patient was afebrile with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg and a pulse of 80 bpm.\\nContent: The patient developed recurrent skin and subcutaneous abscesses, progressive lymphadenopathy, and weight loss over a two-month period. Her symptoms began 6 to 8 weeks after she returned from a family visit to northern Thailand. During that trip, she had experienced an illness with high fever, dry cough, and fatigue, which may have represented acute pulmonary histoplasmosis. Despite various antibiotic therapies prior to transfer, her clinical symptoms and inflammatory markers deteriorated. Initial pus and blood cultures were sterile, and a lymph node biopsy showed non-specific lymphadenitis.\\n---\\n[SYMPTOMS]\\nContent: - Fever, fatigue, chills, sweats, headache, myalgia, anorexia, non-productive cough, arthralgia and nausea\\n- Less common: emotional lability and depression, hyperesthesia, sore throat, abdominal pain, conjunctival injection, photophobia and weight loss\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

While fever and sore throat usually subside within a couple of weeks, the prolonged fatigue and enlarged lymph nodes, as described, are characteristic of mono and can last for several weeks.

They also report persistent perianal itching and increasing shortness of breath, suggesting a potential cardiac involvement. Which diseases could be causing these symptons?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[VASCULAR DISORDERS]\\nContent: The range of arterial and venous syndromes includes diseases of the aorta, atherosclerotic diseases of medium-sized arteries, and unusual vascular disorders of the tropics (Table 2-3).\\nAtheroma and dissection of the aorta is present in communities with an  accumulation  of  risk  factors,  including  hypertension.  Similarly, atheroma and aortic aneurysm is becoming more common in people living  in  tropical  environments  as  their  cardiovascular  risk  profile worsens. By contrast, aortitis resulting from syphilis is less common due  to  the  early  use  of  penicillin.  Idiopathic  tropical  aortitis  or Takayasu's disease is found in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. The clinical manifestations depend on the stage and anatomy of the disease. The disease may present with angina, cerebral ischemic symptoms, absent pulses, and hypertension - a common presentation in children [6].\\nAtherosclerotic disease of the medium-sized vessels presents with a number of clinical syndromes including cardiac pain and coronary thrombosis, intermittent claudication and gangrene of the legs, and mesenteric artery  occlusion. These ischemic syndromes are particularly common in people of Asian, Melanesian and Polynesian origin (who also have a high incidence of diabetes mellitus). Angina in the tropical environment may also be due to valvular heart disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dysrhythmias, syphilitic arteritis or anemia.\\nHemoglobin disorders (such as sickle cell disease) contribute to the cardiovascular disease burden either by exacerbating existing cardiac disease with anemia, or by causing peripheral vascular occlusion or pulmonary hypertension.\\nIdiopathic gangrene of the extremities, gangrene associated with tropical  phlebitis,  and  gangrene  associated  with  acquired  hemolytic anemia are unusual vascular disorders encountered  in Africa.  Idiopathic  gangrene  of  the  extremities  presents  mainly  in  infants  and children  with  bilateral  symmetrical  gangrene.

This was confirmed by two positive serological tests for IgG antibodies against T. cruzi. The diagnosis was further supported by her clinical presentation of progressive dyspnoea and palpitations, combined with objective findings of sinus bradycardia with right bundle branch block on ECG and moderate cardiomegaly on chest X-ray, all consistent with chronic Chagas disease in a patient from an endemic region of Bolivia. The patient's desire to become pregnant also supported the decision for antitrypanosomal therapy to prevent vertical transmission.\\nVitals: On examination, blood pressure was 110/65 mmHg. The pulse was regular at 40 bpm. SpO2 was 99% on ambient air.\\nContent: Given the patient's origin as a recent migrant from Bolivia, a highly endemic country, the initial differential included common migrant-associated pathologies such as active and latent tuberculosis, HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and strongyloidiasis, with particular emphasis on Chagas disease due to its high prevalence and potential for asymptomatic chronic infection in Latin American migrants. The patient's progressive dyspnoea and palpitations, combined with ECG findings of sinus bradycardia with right bundle branch block and CXR showing cardiomegaly, strongly suggested chronic Chagasic cardiomyopathy.\\n---\\n[COMMON SYNDROMES OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE IN THE TROPICS]\\nContent: TABLE 2-1 Causes of Heart Failure in the Tropics, 1 = TABLE 2-1 Causes of Heart Failure in the Tropics.

The diagnosis was established based on the characteristic clinical presentation of progressive, indurated ulcers with undermined edges on the extremity of a child from an endemic region in West Africa. It was definitively confirmed by a positive PCR result for M. ulcerans from a wound swab. The paradoxical enlargement of one ulcer during therapy is a known phenomenon and not indicative of treatment failure.\\nVitals: On presentation, the patient had a pulse of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 100/70 mmHg, and a temperature of 37.9 °C (100.2 °F).\\nContent: The most likely diagnosis was considered to be Buruli ulcer, based on the geographical region, young age of the patient, location of the lesions on an extremity, and classic clinical picture.

For  specific  clinical  manifestations  of  nutritional  deficiencies,  see  Table  8-2  and  corresponding chapters.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Thinness  and  short  stature  may  be  the  only  features  of  moderate underweight, stunting and wasting. The manifestation of severe acute malnutrition can be quite dramatic and the major signs include severe wasting,  edema,  skin  changes  or  dermatosis,  and  eye  signs.  Severe wasting occurs when there is loss of body fat, subcutaneous tissues and muscles. In a severe case, the body appears to have only skin and bones with wrinkling of the skin, the head looks disproportionately large and the ribs are markedly visible (Fig. 138.3). The skin becomes redundant on the severely wasted buttocks, giving a 'baggy pants' appearance (Fig. 138.4). A WHZ of less than -3SD and a MUAC less than 1 1.5 cm indicate severe wasting.\\nIn the absence of other causes of edema, such as nephrotic syndrome, the presence of bilateral pedal edema is a sign of SAM. A decrease in serum albumin level is partly responsible for development of edema. Other factors that contribute to the development of edema in SAM include decreased body potassium and reduced inactivation of antidiuretic hormone. Edema is detected by pressing on the dorsum of the foot for 3-5 seconds; an indentation on release of pressure indicates pedal edema (Fig. 138.5).\\nBased on severity, there are three categories of edema:\\nMild: both feet (can include ankles), grade + ; Moderate:  both  feet,  lower  legs,  hands  or  lower  arms,  grade + + ; Severe: generalized bilateral pitting edema including both feet, legs, hands, arms and face, grade + + + .\\nDermatosis is a skin condition that is common in severe acute malnutrition.

The diagnosis was made clinically based on the characteristic triad of photosensitive dermatitis, watery diarrhoea, and neuropsychiatric symptoms ('dementia'). The diagnosis was confirmed by the rapid resolution of her confusion and diarrhoea following supplementation with a vitamin B-complex. Her poor, maize-based diet provided a strong epidemiological link, and other key differential diagnoses like HIV were ruled out by testing.\\nVitals: The patient is afebrile.

In adults, other causes of dysentery are more common than in children, but all patients with severe dysentery in the tropics still have a high probability of having shigellosis.\\nIn addition to the dysenteric stool, other features supportive of the diagnosis of shigellosis include abdominal tenderness, fever (though less common in malnourished children), and rectal prolapse. During a S.  dysenteriae type  1  epidemic,  the probability that dysentery  is  a result of Shigella infection is even greater.\\nThe laboratory test that is likely to be most immediately available in developing countries is microscopic examination of the stool using either a wet mount or Gram-stain. Either will show large numbers of polymorphonuclear cells and erythrocytes. Other supportive laboratory tests include a peripheral blood leukocyte count with leukocytosis. Though rapid bedside tests for identification of Shigella infection have been developed [18], none are commercially available. Rapid tests for the identification of Shiga toxin exist, and could, presumably, be of help in the diagnosis of S. dysenteriae type 1 infections.

Immediately after delivery, I started experiencing profuse, continuous vaginal bleeding, and my uterus feels soft and boggy, not firm. I am feeling extremely lightheaded, weak, and very pale. What should I be worried about given these symptoms after childbirth?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[HEMORRHAGE]\\nContent: Obstetric haemorrhage is the most commonly documented cause of maternal death. This can take the form of antepartum bleeding (e.g. as  a  result  of  placenta  praevia or placental abruption), intrapartum bleeding  (e.g.  as  a  result  of  rupture  of  the  uterus)  or  post-partum hemorrhage (e.g. as a result of atony of the uterus, associated with disseminated vascular coagulopathy, or trauma to the genital tract). Any bleeding during pregnancy and delivery should be considered a 'danger' or warning sign and requires urgent attention.\\nPlacental abruption can occur suddenly and unexpectedly. In many resource-poor settings, in the absence of ultrasonography, the warning signs of bleeding, coupled with the clinical sign of a 'uterus en bois' (woody hard uterus which feels contracted), will alert the healthcare provider to this emergency. In the case of placenta previa, a cesarean section is needed.\\nPost-partum hemorrhage is commonly defined as blood loss of more than 500 ml and severe post-partum hemorrhage as a loss of more than 1000 ml. Most cases are unpredictable and it is vital that there is  early recognition of excess blood loss and immediate action. The majority of cases are the result of uterine atony post-delivery, either after  vaginal  delivery  or  cesarean  section.  The  recommended  treatment  is  uterotonics  (drugs  to  stimulate  uterine  contraction)  and prompt replacement of volume lost to avoid hypovolemic shock.\\nThere are a number of uterotonics available, including oxytocin and ergometrine (the traditional and well-proven first-line approach), as well as more recent prostaglandins, such as carboprost and misoprostol. Blood transfusion is frequently needed and many women in\\nFIGURE 16.1 Causes of maternal deaths in Africa.\\nFIGURE 16.2 Causes of maternal deaths in Asia.\\nresource-poor areas do not survive hemorrhage because blood transfusion services are not available at all or insufficient blood is given. In addition, in cases of hemorrhage as a result of coagulopathy, such as is associated with abruption placenta and eclampsia, the availability of blood is crucial.\\n---\\n[SEPSIS]\\nContent: Most maternal deaths from infection occur in the postnatal period as a result of puerperal sepsis defined as 'a temperature rise above 38.5 degrees  Celsius  maintained  over  24  hours  or  recurring  during  the period  from  the  end  of  the  first  to  the  end  of  the  tenth  day  after childbirth  or  after  abortion' .  Clinical  signs  and  symptoms  include fever, lower abdominal pain and uterine tenderness, subinvolution of the uterus with foul smelling, sometimes purulent, discharge with or without vaginal bleeding. Failure to recognize and manage puerperal sepsis early on will lead to septic shock and coagulopathy.\\nThe  clinical  diagnosis  of  sepsis  is  relatively  simple  and  does  not require laboratory tests. In practice, fever in the post-partum period is  often  attributed  solely  to  malaria,  especially  in  malaria-endemic areas. Full clinical examination and a thick film slide will help with the differential diagnosis, as will the realization that, in many postpartum women, such fever is more likely to be associated with puerperal  sepsis  than  malaria.  Parenteral  antibiotics  are  needed  and generally  given  for  24-48  hours.  There  are  various  recommended regimens but in the absence of availability of blood-culture testing (as in  most  resource-poor  areas),  the  best  combination  is  ampicillin, gentamycin  and  metronidazol.  The  presence  of  retained  placental fragments and/or fetal tissue in the case of abortion must be considered. Poor hygiene during delivery, during obstetric surgery, such as cesarean section or evacuation of the uterus (for termination of pregnancy or removal of retained products after an incomplete abortion), can  all  lead  to  puerperal  sepsis.  Good  hand-washing  practice  and adequate sterilization of equipment used during surgical procedures are  crucial  preventive  measures.  Prophylactic  antibiotics  should  be given in all cases of cesarean section. Infection with HIV is associated with reduced immunity, an increased risk of opportunistic infections and reported increased difficulty in treating post-partum sepsis, either after delivery or cesarean section.\\n---\\n[COMPLICATIONS OF OBSTRUCTED LABOR]\\nContent: Obstructed labor is a condition contributing to maternal death in a number of ways, for example via haemorrhage as a result of rupture of the uterus or via sepsis. Morbidity associated with obstructed labor includes obstetric fistulae (vesico-vaginal and/or rectal). Obstructed labor is said to occur when there are good uterine contractions but there  is  no  descent  of  the  fetus  through  the  pelvis.  This  may  be because the fetus is too large for the pelvis (fetopelvic disproportion) and/or there are pelvic abnormalities  (e.g.  associated with  rickets). Malposition of the fetus or congenital fetal abnormalities (e.g. hydrocephalus) can also be associated with obstructed labor. Clinical signs of rupture of the uterus include vaginal bleeding, hypovolemic shock, tender abdomen, an abnormal uterine contour, absent fetal heart and easily palpable fetal parts. A 'Bandl's' ring can often be seen prior to rupture  of  the  uterus  and  is  a  visible  horizontal  depression  in  the lower  abdominal  contour  near  the  umbilicus  which  indicates  the marcation between the thick muscular upper uterine segment and a very thin, stretched out lower uterine segment.\\nIn  cases  of  obstructed labor,  in order to save both  the mother and baby's lives, a timely cesarean section is needed. For this, the woman will need to be delivered in a health facility providing all the nine signal functions of Comprehensive Essential Obstetric Care (see Box 16.2) and referral may be needed if she is laboring at a lower-level facility. Such referral must be well organized and requires transport and communication systems to be in place.\\nObstructed  labor  can  be  detected  by  using  a  partograph.  This  is  a simple structured graphical one-page representation of the progress of a woman's labor and is recommended as a tool to monitor progress in all women during labor, as well as a documentation of the fetal condition. It consists of a graph depicting cervical dilatation in relation to time-in most cases also the degree of descent of the fetal presenting part-the strength and frequency of contractions and the\\n---\\n[HEMORRHAGE]\\nContent: It may be necessary to explore the uterus for retained placental tissue. Retained placenta is a common problem leading to post-partum hemorrhage and all skilled birth attendants need to be able to carry out a manual removal of placenta under suitable analgesia (or anesthesia) and/or refer a woman with this condition to a higher level facility in good time. Retained placental tissue and/or membranes can lead to prolonged bleeding and high risk of infection. This requires careful exploration of the uterus under anesthesia and curettage. For hemorrhage occurring after a cesarean section, re-laparotomy may be necessary to check that this is not the result of unrecognized tears in the uterus and/or faulty surgical technique. In some cases with unstoppable hemorrhage, the only solution may be to perform a (subtotal) hysterectomy.\\nPost-partum hemorrhage can be prevented-it is recommended that all women have active management of the third stage of labor. This consists of administering a uterotonic (preferably oxytocin intramuscularly) at the time of delivery, together with clamping and cutting the  cord  and  controlled  cord  traction  (gentle  cord  traction  with manual support of the uterus) to deliver the placenta. The oxytocin is given at the time of birth of the anterior shoulder; if it is not known whether this could be a multiple pregnancy, it should be given at the time of the birth of the baby, after checking there is no second baby. In some cases, this is combined with uterine massage or fundal pressure  after  delivery  of  the  placenta.  The  routine  administration  of oxytocin  reduces  the  risk  of  hemorrhage  by  more  than  half  when compared with 'physiologic' or expectant management (i.e. no oxytocic, no controlled cord traction, with the cord being clamped and cut after the placenta has been delivered by maternal effort only).\\n---\\n[MALARIA IN PREGNANCY]\\nContent: The effects of malaria infection in pregnancy are visited on the expectant mother via peripheral parasitemia and on the fetus/newborn via parasite sequestration in the intervillous spaces of the placenta.\\nIn general, pregnant woman are more susceptible to malaria infection than their non-pregnant counterparts; this is most noticeable in areas of  low  transmission,  where  few  adults  have  acquired  anti-disease immunity. Susceptibility to infection decreases with each succeeding pregnancy.\\nThe placenta provides a new site for sequestration, a phenomenon unique  to  infections  with P.  falciparum ,  and,  as  with  peripheral\\nparasitemia, semi-immune women are less likely to have placental sequestration than non-immune women, and the placentae of multigravidae are less likely to contain evidence of parasite sequestration than those of primigravidae. The receptor on the syncytiotrophoblast lining the intervillous spaces of the placenta is chondroitin sulfate A, and binding is mediated by a specific variant surface antigen, var2csa [17].\\nClinical manifestations in the mother are determined by the extent of acquired immunity. In sub-Saharan Africa, where most studies have been  carried  out,  mild  febrile  illnesses  and  anemia  are  the  most common features. In relatively non-immune pregnant women, severe and complicated malaria, often characterized by hypoglycemia and pulmonary edema, can occur. Pregnancy-induced immune suppression generally results in more severe disease, especially in the group at highest risk, primigravid, non-immune women. Parasitemia rates are  at  their  highest  during  the  second  trimester,  and  the  period  of increased risk can extend into the post-partum period for 1-2 months [18].\\nAdverse  maternal  and  perinatal  outcomes  of  malaria  in  pregnancy include anemia, miscarriage, fetal growth restriction (small for gestational age), low birth weight ( < 2500 g at birth), pre-term births and congenital  infection.  Again,  the  likelihood  of  these  outcomes  is related  to  maternal  gravidity  and  degree  of  acquired  anti-malarial immunity.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

What might be happening?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[OSTEOMYELITIS (OSM)]\\nContent: the host response will attempt to reabsorb all the necrotic material, including the dead cortical bone, or sequestrum. The periosteum will lay down new living bone, called involucrum (Fig. 13.3). If the resorption process is incomplete, some of the sequestrum may be incorporated within the involucrum. This piece of dead bone acts as a foreign body  that  harbors  bacteria,  and  cannot  be  sterilized  by  antibiotics alone. This is the stage of chronic OSM, with recurrent intermittent episodes of acute OSM-like symptoms that are relieved by antibiotics and/or  spontaneous  drainage  from  a  re-opened  fistula.  Chronic drainage from permanently patent sinuses prevent pressure build-up within the bone and patients are less likely to have acute symptoms of pain and fever, but these longstanding fistulas are at increased risk of sarcomatous degeneration. Joints where the metaphyses are intraarticular (shoulder, elbow, hip and ankle) very often also have septic arthritis.\\nAcute OSM should always be suspected in a sick child complaining of limb pain, even if x-rays are normal. Fever, local swelling and tenderness,  and  guarding are  common physical findings.  Leukocytosis with a left shift, a very elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and  a  negative  malaria  test  are  usual  laboratory  findings.  Because malaria is a common cause of fever, patients with acute OSM often present late. Another reason for late presentation, as demonstrated in a study from Uganda, is that more than half of patients have first seen a traditional healer [7]. Thus, abnormal x-ray findings are common even at initial assessment.\\n---\\n[SEPTIC ARTHRITIS]\\nContent: Bacterial septic arthritis can affect any joint, but hip, knee and shoulder  are  the  most  common,  either  as  an  isolated  pathology  or  in conjunction  with  an  intra-articular  metaphyseal  osteomyelitis.  Late presentation is common. Parents often give a history of trauma: the patient fell a few days ago and has refused to bear weight ever since on the involved extremity. Examination usually reveals a septic child, with localized swelling over the involved joint, which is painful on palpation or passive mobilization. Basic laboratory findings are nonspecific: elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and ESR. Plain x-rays can appear normal early on, or show only soft tissue swelling, but there will eventually be a widening of the joint space when compared to the contralateral side, which can lead to complete dislocation.\\nThe differential diagnosis should include tuberculosis, inflammatory arthropathies,  transient  synovitis,  post-traumatic  hemarthrosis,  and avascular necrosis. Joint aspiration can be very useful. S. aureus is the most common pathogen, but other bacteria can be involved, such as gonococcus in adolescents, Haemophilus influenzae in newborns and very young infants, and Salmonella enterica in patients with sickle cell disease. Surgical drainage should be considered whenever there is a clinical suspicion, and performed as early as possible. The downsides of a negative arthrotomy are far outweighed by the dire consequences of a neglected septic arthritis, particularly in a weight-bearing joint.\\nOther nonbacterial  pathogens can involve the musculoskeletal system: fungi (histoplasmosis, actinomycosis, blastomycosis, aspergillosis),  treponema  (yaws,  syphilis)  or  parasites  (dracunculiasis  or guinea worm, onchocerciasis). Their diagnosis and treatment are discussed in other sections of this text.\\n---\\n[OSTEOMYELITIS (OSM)]\\nContent: There are three ways in which bones can become infected: hematogenous dissemination of pathogens, a contiguous focus of infection (e.g. discitis), or direct contact with the 'outside world' from an open fracture or a surgical procedure. Acute OSM occurs more commonly in children, usually through hematogenous seeding. Any bone can be affected, but the femur and tibia account for around 50% of cases [6]. In the adult, infection usually follows an open fracture or as a complication from an orthopedic procedure. Chronic OSM is the result of untreated or poorly treated acute OSM, with residual foci of avascular  bone  and  soft  tissue  debris  leading  to  recurrent  episodes  of infections, with or without chronic sinus formation.\\nAcute  hematogenous OSM  starts in  the  metaphysis  of  long  bones, where the microcirculation is sluggish (Fig. 13.2). As pressure builds up in the purulent material, the endosteal circulation is destroyed. If pus finds its way through the cortical bone, the periosteum is separated from the cortex, which then becomes completely avascular. The periosteum  remains  viable  and  attempts  to  wall-off  the  infectious process. This becomes visible on plain x-rays as a periosteal reaction within 10 to 20 days. The pus itself may perforate the periosteum and follow planes of least resistance to create soft tissue abscesses, and can even break through the skin to create a sinus or fistula. Eventually,\\n\\nTABLE 13-1 The 20 Leading Non-fatal Injuries* Sustained as a Result of Road TraEc Collisions, World, 2002\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Cutaneous myiasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The diagnosis is cutaneous furuncular myiasis caused by the larva of the Tumbu fly, *Cordylobia anthropophaga*.

Extensive investigations, including serologies and CSF analysis, ruled out common infectious causes like HIV, syphilis, tuberculosis, and schistosomiasis. Normal spinal x-rays made a compressive lesion unlikely.\\nVitals: On presentation, vital signs were normal.\\nContent: The patient was well until two days prior to presentation, when she developed acute back pain that radiated in a band-like fashion to her umbilicus.

This  deficiency  often results when there is a decrease or absence of breastfeeding, feeding on diluted milk formula or a delay in introducing solid foods in the diet. In marasmus, the body generally adapts itself to the deficiency of energy and protein. The muscles provide amino acids leading to the  production  of  proteins  including  albumin  and β -lipoprotein. Adequate amounts of albumin and β -lipoprotein prevent the development of edema and fatty enlargement of the liver in marasmus.\\nKwashiorkor, which occurs mostly in children 1-3 years of age, results from a deficiency of dietary protein and is usually associated with an infection. Typically, there are skin lesions (pigmented or de-pigmented areas with or without ulceration), scanty lustre-less hair, loss of interest in the surroundings and loss of appetite (Fig. 138.6). The edema is usually noticed in the feet, but can also occur in other parts of the body. β -lipoprotein is not produced in adequate amounts, resulting in impaired transport of fat and an enlarged fatty liver.\\n---\\n[PHYSICAL EXAM]\\nDisease: Hepatosplenic schistosomiasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The diagnosis is hepatosplenic schistosomiasis causing periportal fibrosis, portal hypertension, and subsequent bleeding from gastro-oesophageal varices. This was established based on the patient's residence in an endemic area, the clinical triad of haematemesis, massive splenomegaly, and pancytopenia, and confirmed by ultrasound findings of 'pipestem fibrosis'. Endoscopy identified the varices as the source of bleeding, while negative hepatitis serologies helped exclude other common causes.\\nVitals: On admission, her blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg, pulse was 110 bpm, and respiratory rate was 28 breaths per minute. She was afebrile.\\nContent: The patient was a slim woman with slightly pale conjunctivae, but no jaundice or subconjunctival effusions. Abdominal examination revealed no distension or tenderness. The spleen was palpable at 10 cm below the left costal margin, and the liver was slightly enlarged. There were no stigmata of chronic liver disease, no shifting dullness, and no peripheral oedema or enlarged lymph nodes.\\n---\\n[PHYSICAL EXAM]\\nDisease: Talaromycosis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is disseminated Talaromycosis caused by the dimorphic fungus Talaromyces marneffei. The diagnosis was established by the characteristic clinical syndrome of fever, wasting, pancytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, and umbilicated papules in a patient with severe immunosuppression from previously undiagnosed AIDS (CD4 count 2/μL). It was definitively confirmed by the isolation of the organism from cultures of blood, skin, and lymph node tissue.\\nVitals: On presentation, the patient was febrile with a temperature of 38.2°C (100.76°F). No other vital signs were reported.\\nContent: Physical examination revealed a very wasted man with pale conjunctivae. He had a generalized, non-pruritic rash consisting of small umbilicated papules, predominantly on his face and trunk. There was generalized lymphadenopathy, including swollen supraclavicular, inguinal, and axillary nodes. Abdominal examination showed hepatosplenomegaly, with a liver span of 15 cm and a spleen palpable two fingers below the left costal margin.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES ACHILDREN AND NEONATESB]\\nContent: The clinical spectrum encountered in congenital syphilis shows some notable departures from syphilis in adults. Many infections result in abortion, stillbirth, or hydrops fetalis. Infants born alive with severe infection show  low  birth weight, failure to  thrive,  and  multi-organ involvement,  including  hepatosplenomegaly,  rhinitis,  and  anemia.\\nFIGURE  53.7 Severe  congenital  syphilis  in  a  neonate  showing  bullous lesions present from birth (photo courtesy of D. McGregor).\\nSkin  lesions  may  display  an  atypical  bullous  character  (Fig.  53.7). More commonly, congenital syphilis presents some weeks after birth. Desquamating plantar and palmar lesions similar to those of adults are common. Painful periostitis presenting as 'pseudoparalysis' of a limb  may  develop.  Late  congenital  syphilis  is  rarely  encountered nowadays.

Over the years, I've developed symptoms of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and have recently been diagnosed with diabetes. I'm also experiencing some weight loss. What could be the cause of these issues?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[ABDOMINAL PAIN]\\nContent: Upper abdominal pain is commonly due to peptic ulcer disease, and worsening of the symptoms may herald a complication such as perforation or penetration. The differential diagnosis of upper abdominal symptoms with ulceration in the stomach or duodenum includes infections (e.g. tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium intracellulare , cytomegalovirus,  herpes  simplex  virus),  neoplasms  (either  primary tumor or metastatic disease) and infiltrative diseases. Acute pancreatitis is another cause of acute upper abdominal pain; gallstones and alcohol are the most common causes worldwide, though infectious etiologies are important in the immunocompromised. Chronic pancreatitis is characterized by abdominal pain, steatorrhea and diabetes mellitus. Alcohol abuse accounts for the majority of cases worldwide; however, in several parts of the tropics, the most common cause of chronic  pancreatitis  is  tropical  calcific  pancreatitis,  a  condition  of unknown etiology that commonly affects children. Pancreatic calcifications may be seen on plain film of the abdomen, and ductal dilatation may be evident on ultrasonography or computed tomography.\\nRight upper quadrant pain may be seen in biliary colic, acute cholecystitis, acute cholangitis, acute hepatitis, and liver abscess (see hepatobiliary  chapter).  Left  upper  quadrant  pain  may  be  caused  by disorders of the spleen such as splenomegaly or splenic abscess or infarction. In evaluating the patient with upper abdominal pain, it is important to consider supradiaphragmatic causes such as pneumonia and myocardial infarction.\\nA number of parasitic worms may cause nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms including epigastric pain. In addition, parasitic infections of the biliary tract may lead to acute pancreatitis, as exemplified by adult Ascaris lumbricoides worms, which can migrate from the jejunum and invade the papilla, obstructing the pancreatic and bile ducts.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is HTLV-1-associated Strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfection syndrome. This was confirmed by the presence of a high load of S. stercoralis rhabditiform larvae in both stool (via Baermann testing) and respiratory secretions, following initial suspicion from a duodenal biopsy. The diagnosis is supported by the clinical presentation of severe chronic diarrhoea and wasting, the patient's origin from an endemic area for both pathogens, confirmed HTLV-1 co-infection (a known risk factor for hyperinfection), and the excellent clinical and parasitological response to ivermectin therapy.\\nVitals: The patient was afebrile on examination. No other vital signs were reported.\\nContent: The patient reports a 6-month history of severe chronic diarrhoea, colicky abdominal pain, and a 20 kg weight loss. This is an exacerbation of a long-standing issue, as he has suffered from recurrent episodes of diarrhoea and abdominal cramps for over 12 years, with a notable increase in frequency over the past 2 years.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Amoebic liver abscess\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is an amoebic liver abscess, caused by Entamoeba histolytica. This is supported by the clinical triad of fever and tender hepatomegaly with right intercostal tenderness, imaging findings of a large solitary liver lesion with an elevated hemidiaphragm, and the aspiration of characteristic 'brownish pus'. The diagnosis was further confirmed by the patient's rapid clinical response to metronidazole therapy and the relevant epidemiological risk factor of consuming locally brewed alcohol known to be associated with amoebiasis.\\nVitals: On examination, the patient's temperature was 38.3 °C (100.8 °F), blood pressure was 100/80 mmHg, pulse was 102 bpm, and respiratory rate was 24 breath cycles per minute.\\nContent: For the past week, the patient experienced fever, chills, headache, and body aches, along with severe right-hypochondrial pain. The abdominal pain is described as constant, dull, radiating to the right shoulder, and exacerbated by coughing and resting on the right side. Over the last few days, he also developed a dry cough, has vomited twice, and has lost his appetite.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Tuberculous pericarditis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was HIV-associated tuberculous pericarditis with cardiac tamponade. This was established based on the clinical signs of cardiac tamponade (hypotension, tachycardia, pulsus paradoxus, elevated JVP), radiographic evidence of a large pericardial effusion ('globular heart'), and the patient's HIV-positive status in a tuberculosis-endemic region. The diagnosis was functionally confirmed by the dramatic clinical improvement following pericardiocentesis and the successful outcome after initiating antituberculous and antiretroviral therapy.\\nVitals: The patient's pulse was regular at 130 bpm with a pronounced pulsus paradoxus of 15 mmHg. His blood pressure in the supine position was 90/60 mmHg. He was noted to be slightly breathless in the supine position.\\nContent: The patient was well until one month prior to presentation when he began experiencing a feeling of fullness in his upper abdomen. In the week before admission, he developed pain in the right upper abdomen, which was worse when sleeping on his right side. He more recently began to feel breathless on lying down and faint upon standing up.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Thinness  and  short  stature  may  be  the  only  features  of  moderate underweight, stunting and wasting. The manifestation of severe acute malnutrition can be quite dramatic and the major signs include severe wasting,  edema,  skin  changes  or  dermatosis,  and  eye  signs.  Severe wasting occurs when there is loss of body fat, subcutaneous tissues and muscles. In a severe case, the body appears to have only skin and bones with wrinkling of the skin, the head looks disproportionately large and the ribs are markedly visible (Fig. 138.3). The skin becomes redundant on the severely wasted buttocks, giving a 'baggy pants' appearance (Fig. 138.4). A WHZ of less than -3SD and a MUAC less than 1 1.5 cm indicate severe wasting.\\nIn the absence of other causes of edema, such as nephrotic syndrome, the presence of bilateral pedal edema is a sign of SAM. A decrease in serum albumin level is partly responsible for development of edema. Other factors that contribute to the development of edema in SAM include decreased body potassium and reduced inactivation of antidiuretic hormone. Edema is detected by pressing on the dorsum of the foot for 3-5 seconds; an indentation on release of pressure indicates pedal edema (Fig. 138.5).\\nBased on severity, there are three categories of edema:\\nMild: both feet (can include ankles), grade + ; Moderate:  both  feet,  lower  legs,  hands  or  lower  arms,  grade + + ; Severe: generalized bilateral pitting edema including both feet, legs, hands, arms and face, grade + + + .\\nDermatosis is a skin condition that is common in severe acute malnutrition. A child with dermatosis may have patches of skin that are abnormally light or dark in color, shedding of skin in scales or sheets, and ulceration of the skin of the perineum, groin, limbs, behind the ears and in the armpits. There may be weeping lesions. There may be severe  rash in the  distribution of a  diaper.  Secondary infection can occur.\\nFIGURE  138.4 'Baggy  pants'  appearance  in  severe  wasting  or  severe acute malnutrition.\\nFIGURE 138.5 Detection of pedal edema.\\nThe extent of dermatosis is described in the following way:\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

Some of these blood disorders are genetic, whereas others are caused by nutritional disorders such as  iron,  B12 or  folate deficiency,  or chronic diseases  such as hookworm infestation, HIV, lead intoxication, kidney  disease,  or malignancy.  In the future, it is likely that  immigrants  will  bear  a disproportionate  burden  of disease  due to infection-associated cancers, such as hepatoma from chronic hepatitis B and C, carcinoma of  the  cervix  caused  by  human  papillomavirus,  Epstein-Barr  virusassociated Burkitt lymphoma, human herpesvirus-8-associated Kaposi sarcoma, and HIV-associated lymphomas.\\nMalnutrition and stunting of growth can be especially severe in immigrant children and refugees as a result of food deprivation and infections. Malabsorption can result from intestinal protozoan infections or,  rarely,  tropical  sprue;  lactose  intolerance  is  common  among African and certain Asian immigrant groups. Immigrants may present with  specific  nutritional  disorders  such  as  bowing  of  the  legs  in children or osteomalacia in adults with vitamin D deficiency, xerophthalmia secondary to vitamin A deficiency, endemic goiter associated with iodine deficiency, or acrodermatitis with zinc deficiency.\\nDepression  and  stress  are  common  among  immigrants  who  are adapting to a new culture and language.

The  onset  of  clinical disease is insidious, with malaise, anorexia, chills, headache, myalgias and  fever  (38-39°C).  A  few  days  later,  patients  develop  constitutional,  gastrointestinal,  neurologic  and  cardiovascular  signs  and symptoms.  Low  backache,  retro-orbital  pain,  nausea  or  vomiting, epigastric  pain,  photophobia,  dizziness,  and  constipation  or  mild diarrhea might be present in patients. Common absence of productive cough or nasal congestion is helpful in distinguishing the initial symptoms of Argentine hemorrhagic fever from those of influenza or other acute respiratory infections.\\nAs with many other infectious diseases, the first  clinical  manifestations of South American hemorrhagic fevers are nonspecific and can be confused with several acute febrile conditions, therefore the history of potential exposure to infected rodents is critical in the case of South American hemorrhagic fevers. Among the infectious diseases, the differential diagnosis includes typhoid fever, hepatitis, infectious mononucleosis,  leptospirosis,  hantavirus  pulmonary  syndrome,  dengue, dengue hemorrhagic fever and rickettsioses. Malaria should also be considered in endemic areas. Diseases presenting with hematologic or  neurologic  alterations,  such  as  intoxications,  rheumatic  diseases and blood dyscrasias may also be mistaken for hemorrhagic fever. In the respective endemic areas, or in patients with a history of travel to the specific geographic regions, a febrile syndrome with proteinuria, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia is suspicious of one of the South American hemorrhagic fever [6, 7].\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

The diagnosis was confirmed by the rapid and complete resolution of symptoms after a single dose of ivermectin.\\nContent: The patient developed three intensely itchy skin eruptions on both upper thighs just after arriving in Australia, one week prior to presentation. The itch was so severe that it kept him awake at night. He reported no fever, cough, or wheeze and was otherwise completely well.\\n---\\n[DIAGNOSIS]\\nContent: The  differential  diagnosis  of  heat  illness  requires  a  history  of  heat exposure,  a  detailed  physical  exam  and  bedside  studies.  Infectious etiologies and rare causes of hyperthermia need to be ruled out. The differential diagnosis should include malignant hyperthermia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, endocrine and hypothalamic disorders, and fictitious hyperthermia. Heat edema and heat syncope are suggested by advanced patient age, deconditioning, low cardiac reserve and recent arrival in the tropics from cooler regions. Miliaria, a distinct heat dermatosis, is differentiated from other tropical skin maladies  by  the  timing,  distribution  and  physical  appearance  of  skin vesicles.  Miliaria  responds  promptly  to  antihistamines  or  dilute topical chlorhexidine. Heat cramps are a second common malady in unacclimatized individuals;  diagnosis  is  suggested  by  resolution  of cramps with rest and cool treatment, stretching and fluids, and electrolyte  repletion.

The diagnosis was confirmed by the direct microscopic detection of pathognomonic sclerotic cells (Medlar bodies) in skin scrapings. PCR and sequencing from skin tissue identified the causative agent as a Fonsecaea species (F. pedrosoi, F. monophora, or F. nubica). The clinical presentation was complicated by a secondary bacterial superinfection with Escherichia coli. The patient's excellent response to combination antifungal therapy and surgical debridement further supports the diagnosis.\\nVitals: On admission, vital signs were normal and the patient was afebrile.\\nContent: The left lower leg and foot were grossly swollen, with hyperaemic and warm skin. Examination revealed several cauliflower-like masses and oval plaque-like lesions on the left lower leg and foot. The lesions were partly erythematous, fungating, and purulent, with a malodorous discharge.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Tungiasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is tungiasis, an infestation caused by the burrowing female sand flea, Tunga penetrans. The diagnosis was made clinically based on the pathognomonic appearance of a dark nodule on the toe with a central ulceration, the history of white oval granules (eggs) emerging with pressure, and strong epidemiological links, including living on a farm in an endemic region of Bolivia with a similarly affected family member.\\nContent: The patient presented with a slowly growing nodule on the fifth toe of her right foot over several days, causing moderate pain when wearing shoes. Her parents reported that when they tried to squeeze the lesion, they observed white oval granules emerging from the nodule.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Chikungunya is an acute infection of abrupt onset, heralded by fever and severe arthralgia, and followed by other constitutional symptoms and rash lasting for a period of 1-7 days. The incubation period is usually 2-3 days, with a range of 1-12 days. Fever rises abruptly, often reaching 39-40°C accompanied by intermittent shaking chills. This acute phase lasts 2-3 days. The temperature may remit for 1-2 days after a gap of 4-10 days, resulting in a 'saddle back' fever curve that is characteristic of arthropod-borne virus infections.\\nThe arthralgias are polyarticular, migratory and predominantly affect the small joints of the hands, wrists, ankles and feet (Fig. 32.2.2) with lesser involvement of larger joints. During the acute phase, patients complain bitterly of pain when asked to move. They characteristically lie still in the attitude of flexion. Pain on movement is worse in the morning, improved by mild exercise and exacerbated by strenuous exercise. Swelling may occur but fluid accumulation is uncommon. Patients with milder articular manifestation are usually symptom-free within a few weeks, but more severe cases require months to resolve entirely [1, 3]. A study indicated that over 12% of patients develop chronic joint symptoms. Generalized myalgias, as well as back and shoulder pain is common [4].\\nCutaneous  manifestations  are  typical  with  many  patients.  Initially, many present with facial and trunk flushing. This is usually followed by a maculopapular rash. The trunk and limbs are commonly involved (Fig. 32.2.3), but the face, palms and soles may also show lesions. The rash may simply fade or desquamate. Petechiae may occur alone or in association with the rash.\\nDuring the acute phase, most patients will have headache, but it is not  usually  severe.

The initial diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis was confirmed by an AFB-positive fine-needle aspirate from a neck gland. The paradoxical IRIS was diagnosed clinically based on his worsening condition after starting ART, despite evidence of a good virologic and immunologic response. The superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis, likely with Staphylococcus aureus, was confirmed by the second aspirate showing purulent material with coccoid bacteria and the patient's rapid improvement following incision, drainage, and antibiotics.\\nVitals: On presentation, he was febrile with a temperature of 39.2 °C (102.56° F). His pulse was 112 bpm, respiratory rate was 28 breaths per minute, and he had a normal blood pressure.\\nContent: For six weeks, the patient has experienced a productive cough and chest pain, associated with systemic symptoms including weight loss, fevers, and night sweats. During this period, he also developed a painful swelling in his neck. He has no other reported symptoms.\\n---\\n[CHIEF COMPLAINT]\\nDisease: Human Monkeypox\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was human monkeypox. This was a clinical diagnosis based on the patient's acute febrile illness, accompanied by a disseminated, uniform vesiculopustular skin rash involving the face, palms, soles, and oral mucosa, along with prominent generalized and cervical lymphadenopathy. This presentation is highly characteristic of monkeypox and distinguishes it from alternative diagnoses such as varicella, which typically presents with a heterogeneous rash and less prominent lymphadenopathy.\\nVitals: Temperature 38 °C (100.4 °F), pulse 110 beats per minute, blood pressure 105/82 mmHg.\\nContent: Acute febrile illness accompanied by malaise, headache, dry cough, neck swelling, and a disseminated skin rash, which appeared 2 days after initial symptoms.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Visceral leishmaniasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar), caused by a Leishmania protozoan. This diagnosis is supported by the patient's presentation with chronic undulating fever, severe malnutrition, splenomegaly, generalized lymphadenopathy, and pancytopenia. Epidemiological risk was high, as she was from a known endemic area with a family history of the disease. Although an initial rK39 RDT was negative, the diagnosis was confirmed by a positive Direct Agglutination Test (DAT) with a high titre of 1:6400 and a definitive clinical response to treatment with liposomal amphotericin B.\\nVitals: On presentation, her vital signs were: temperature 39.6°C (103.3°F), pulse 96 bpm, and blood pressure 100/60 mmHg.\\nContent: For the past four weeks, the patient has experienced an undulating fever, occurring mainly in the afternoon, accompanied by chills and occasional convulsions. Initially, she was well between febrile episodes and played normally. However, over time she has developed progressive anorexia, a dry cough, chest pain, and joint and back pain.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Histoplasmosis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is disseminated histoplasmosis caused by the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. This was confirmed by the identification of the organism in a submandibular lymph node biopsy via both PCR and subsequent culture. The clinical presentation of disseminated abscesses, osteomyelitis, and generalized lymphadenopathy, along with the patient's travel history to an endemic region in northern Thailand, supported the diagnosis. The dramatic clinical and laboratory response to specific antifungal therapy further confirmed the etiology.\\nVitals: On admission, the patient was afebrile with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg and a pulse of 80 bpm.\\nContent: The patient developed recurrent skin and subcutaneous abscesses, progressive lymphadenopathy, and weight loss over a two-month period. Her symptoms began 6 to 8 weeks after she returned from a family visit to northern Thailand. During that trip, she had experienced an illness with high fever, dry cough, and fatigue, which may have represented acute pulmonary histoplasmosis. Despite various antibiotic therapies prior to transfer, her clinical symptoms and inflammatory markers deteriorated. Initial pus and blood cultures were sterile, and a lymph node biopsy showed non-specific lymphadenitis.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Kaposi's sarcoma\\nDiagnosis Details: The patient was diagnosed with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), an HIV-associated malignancy caused by human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8). The diagnosis was made clinically based on the characteristic widespread dark-purplish plaques on the skin and palate. Pulmonary KS was strongly suspected given his chronic respiratory symptoms, exam findings, and typical chest radiograph changes, in the context of a low CD4 count (134 cells/μL). Tuberculosis, a key differential, was reasonably excluded by negative sputum and GeneXpert testing.\\nVitals: The patient's temperature was 36 °C (96.8 °F), respiratory rate was 32 breaths per minute, and pulse was 102 bpm. He appeared comfortable at rest.\\nContent: The patient presented with a one-month history of dark spots on his arm and leg, which were progressing, accompanied by new facial swelling.

They can lead to cellulitis, or superficial and deep abscesses. Some deep infections, such as hand flexor tendon\\nFIGURE 13.2 Osteomyelitis pathway.\\nsheaths, require early surgical debridement, or significant functional impairment can result.\\nOther soft tissue infections that can be seen in tropical environments are:  atypical  bacteria  (tularemia,  brucellosis),  fungi  (aspergillosis, cryptococcosis), and parasites (echinococosis, trichinosis).\\nTropical  pyomyositis  was  first  described  in  Uganda  in  1968  and presents with single to multiple suppurative lesions within skeletal muscle. It is more common in HIV-positive patients. Large muscles of the lower extremities and pelvic girdle are common sites of infection. Studies suggest up to 50% of patients report a previous injury. Examination usually reveals fever, diffuse fusiform swelling, and significant tenderness on palpation or passive stretching of the involved muscle, but usually no palpable fluid collection or fluctuation. The abscess is subfascial, within the muscle tissue itself, and poorly contained. S. aureus accounts for near 90% of cases. Multiple attempts at aspiration  with  a  large-bore  needle  are  often  necessary  to  retrieve purulent material,  and  should  be done  when  the  diagnosis  is  suspected.

The diagnosis aligns with the patient's travel history to the Amazon Basin, the preceding dengue-like febrile illness, and the characteristic prolonged symmetrical polyarthralgias primarily affecting small peripheral joints, while other common travel-related viral and bacterial causes were ruled out by serology.\\nVitals: No specific vital signs were reported other than the occurrence of an acute febrile illness with chills.\\nContent: During the second week of a 3.5-week trip to the Amazon Basin of northern Peru, the patient developed an acute febrile illness with chills, malaise, frontal headache, generalized myalgia, and a transient, non-pruritic maculopapular rash. The rash began on the forearms about 1 week after fever onset, spread to the trunk, neck, and face, and faded after 3 days. Slowly progressive, debilitating polyarthralgias affecting peripheral joints, with transient joint swelling, also developed. Painful cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy lasted for about 1 week. Fever and other acute symptoms subsided within 1 week, but polyarthralgias persisted, showing a symmetrical pattern mainly affecting the small joints of the hands and feet, wrists, ankles, and knees. Upon return to Switzerland a few weeks later, the patient reported stiffness of the affected joints, mainly in the morning and after immobility, and the joint pains did not improve for two more months.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Chikungunya is an acute infection of abrupt onset, heralded by fever and severe arthralgia, and followed by other constitutional symptoms and rash lasting for a period of 1-7 days.

Weeks after the procedure, they developed a persistent fever, profound fatigue, significant weight loss, abdominal discomfort, and noticeable yellowing of the skin and eyes. What could be the underlying issue?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[SEVERE ANEMIA]\\nContent: Life-threatening  anemia  can  develop  rapidly;  children  who  have adjusted to a low hemoglobin or hematocrit can rapidly decompensate when challenged by a febrile illness such as malaria. Decisions regarding  blood  transfusion  are  difficult,  particularly  in  malariaendemic areas where HIV infection is common. Decisions to transfuse are generally made on the basis of hemodynamic grounds (signs of high-output heart failure include hypotension, poor capillary refill, systolic  murmurs and hepatosplenomegaly), level of consciousness and evidence of acidosis. Estimates of parasite density are helpful in predicting the  need for blood transfusion (see  below, ' Treatment '). Anemic children who are clinically stable may be treated conservatively, but close observation is recommended.\\n---\\n[ANEMIA]\\nContent: The  evidence  base  for  treating  severe  malarial  anemia  is  scanty. 'Transfusion  triggers'  are  difficult  to  develop  because  the  rate  at which an anemia develops is as important as the absolute value of the hemoglobin concentration but, in general, transfusions begin to be considered when the hemoglobin drops below 5 gm/dL [packed cell volume (PCV) = 15%]. Clinical clues include signs of hemodynamic  instability  (passive  congestion  of  the  liver, systolic  flow murmurs, extra heart sounds, rales, tachycardia) and cerebral hypoperfusion.  The  clinical  decision  regarding  transfusion  should  take into account the peripheral parasitemia, as well as the hemoglobin concentration (or hematocrit): the higher the parasitemia, the lower the hemoglobin or hematocrit are likely to drop. The usual practice is  to  transfuse  whole  blood (20 ml/kg) or  packed cells (10 ml/kg), irrespective  of  the  degree  of  the  anemia  or  the  intensity  of  the parasitemia.  About  5%  of  pediatric patients require a  second transfusion.\\n---\\n[OUTCOMES OF BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS]\\nContent: In-hospital  case-fatality  rates  following  blood  transfusions  in  lowincome African countries range from 6% to 20% [7,54-56]. In children, prostration, respiratory distress and profound anemia\\n(hemoglobin < 4 g/dL)  are  all  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of death. Around a third of these deaths occur within 6 hours of admission to hospital, so appropriate emergency management is crucial [9]. Recent studies have indicated that the respiratory distress and cardiovascular changes associated with acute severe anemia in children are due to hypovolemia rather than heart failure [57-59], and studies are underway to determine the optimal emergency management procedures for these children. In some children in malaria-endemic regions, anemia may fail to resolve or severe anemia may recur within a few weeks after  discharge  from  hospital,  possibly  due  to  persistence  of low-level malaria parasitemia [60,61].\\n---\\n[MALARIA]\\nContent: Anemia can occur with all species of malaria but is especially common with Plasmodium  falciparum infection.  The  cause  of  the  anemia  is multifactorial and includes intracellular parasites, hypersplenism and dyserythropoiesis  caused  by  cytokine  imbalance  [9].  In  malariaendemic areas, anemia is most common in those with the highest prevalence of infection, such as young children and pregnant women. Anemia caused by malaria generally responds to antimalarial treatment but children need careful follow-up as anemia may recur or only improve slowly. Blood transfusion should be limited to those who have signs of life-threatening complications of anemia, such as cardiac failure  and  severe  tissue  under-perfusion,  and  are  unresponsive  to other resuscitation measures.\\nHyper-reactive malarial splenomegaly occurs particularly in women in malaria-endemic areas and has a familial tendency. It is characterized by massive splenomegaly ( ≥ 10 cm) with hypersplenism, hepatomegaly and raised IgM levels [10]. Treatment is malarial prophylaxis  (usually  proguanil  100 mg/day)  though  other  anti-malarials appropriate for long-term administration can be tried. The presence of a lymphocytosis may suggest an underlying lymphoma and should prompt referral to a specialist.\\n---\\n[N O N I N FE CTI O U S  DI S E A S E S O F I M M I G RA N TS]\\nContent: Fatigue, bruising, and nonhealing sores can suggest blood disorders, including anemias and thalassemias, particularly among people from the Mediterranean, Africa, and Asia. Some of these blood disorders are genetic, whereas others are caused by nutritional disorders such as  iron,  B12 or  folate deficiency,  or chronic diseases  such as hookworm infestation, HIV, lead intoxication, kidney  disease,  or malignancy.  In the future, it is likely that  immigrants  will  bear  a disproportionate  burden  of disease  due to infection-associated cancers, such as hepatoma from chronic hepatitis B and C, carcinoma of  the  cervix  caused  by  human  papillomavirus,  Epstein-Barr  virusassociated Burkitt lymphoma, human herpesvirus-8-associated Kaposi sarcoma, and HIV-associated lymphomas.\\nMalnutrition and stunting of growth can be especially severe in immigrant children and refugees as a result of food deprivation and infections. Malabsorption can result from intestinal protozoan infections or,  rarely,  tropical  sprue;  lactose  intolerance  is  common  among African and certain Asian immigrant groups. Immigrants may present with  specific  nutritional  disorders  such  as  bowing  of  the  legs  in children or osteomalacia in adults with vitamin D deficiency, xerophthalmia secondary to vitamin A deficiency, endemic goiter associated with iodine deficiency, or acrodermatitis with zinc deficiency.\\nDepression  and  stress  are  common  among  immigrants  who  are adapting to a new culture and language. Post-traumatic stress disorder and other psychiatric problems are not uncommon among refugees, especially those who have experienced torture, rape, and other physical trauma in war-torn countries. Those who care for immigrants may find  that  disclosures  of  trauma  occur  only  after  development  of  a trusting  relationship  with  the  healthcare  provider.

This susceptibility is  greatest  when  the  CD4  cell count  declines  below  200 cells/ μ l. In high-income countries, the term 'AIDS' describes the most advanced stage of HIV-infection characterized by severe immunodeficiency (e.g. CD4 cell count < 200 cells/ μ l in the USA) and development  of  opportunistic  illnesses.  In  addition,  HIV  causes  chronic inflammation  and  has  direct  effects  on  a  variety  of  organs;  many patients suffer from enteropathy, myopathy, neuropathy, or encephalopathy. Disease progression in the absence of ART varies with characteristics of the infecting virus, the host immune response and other factors. In general, disease progression is more rapid in children and older adults. Among infants, acquisition of HIV in utero predicts more rapid disease progression in the absence of treatment [89].\\n---\\n[REACTIVATION CHAGAS DISEASE IN HIV/AIDS PATIENTS]\\nContent: Reactivation  of T.  cruzi infection  in  HIV/AIDS  patients  can  cause severe clinical disease with high risk of mortality [27, 28]. However, reactivation is not universal, even in those with low CD4 + lymphocyte counts.  The  only  published  prospective  cohort  study  followed  53 HIVT. cruzi co-infected patients in Brazil for 1-190 months; 1 1 (21%) had T.  cruzi reactivation  diagnosed  based  on  symptoms  and/or microscopically-detectable parasitemia [28]. Even in the absence of clinical  reactivation,  parasitemia  levels  are  higher  among  HIV-coinfected patients compared with HIV-negative patients. Symptomatic T. cruzi reactivation in AIDS patients is most commonly reported to cause meningoencephalitis and/or T. cruzi brain abscesses; the presentation may be confused with CNS toxoplasmosis and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of mass lesions on imaging or  CNS  syndromes  in  AIDS  patients.  The  second  most  commonly reported sign is acute myocarditis, sometimes superimposed on preexisting chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy. Patients may present with new arrhythmias, pericardial effusion, acute cardiac decompensation or  accelerated  progression  of  chronic  heart  disease.  Less  common manifestations  of  reactivation  in  HIV/AIDS  patients  include  skin lesions, erythema nodosum and parasitic invasion of the peritoneum, stomach or intestine.\\n---\\n[PATIENT INFORMATION]\\nDisease: Talaromycosis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is disseminated Talaromycosis caused by the dimorphic fungus Talaromyces marneffei. The diagnosis was established by the characteristic clinical syndrome of fever, wasting, pancytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, and umbilicated papules in a patient with severe immunosuppression from previously undiagnosed AIDS (CD4 count 2/μL). It was definitively confirmed by the isolation of the organism from cultures of blood, skin, and lymph node tissue.\\nVitals: On presentation, the patient was febrile with a temperature of 38.2°C (100.76°F). No other vital signs were reported.\\nContent: A 34-year-old man from Phuket, Thailand, who presented in a very wasted state with a body mass index of 14 kg/m^2.

He had experienced a weight loss of 7 kg in the preceding three months.\\n---\\n[NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS AND PATHOLOGY]\\nContent: In response, the host generates both a humoral and cellular adaptive immune response and HIV viremia declines. This decline results primarily from the immune response (particularly the development of cytotoxic  CD8 + T  lymphocytes  against  HIV)  but  also,  to  a  lesser degree, from the depletion of available target cells. Within 6 months, an individual's viral load will reach a set-point; many individuals will be asymptomatic for years, although they remain infectious. The HIV viral load set-point varies greatly among individuals (in one study of 74  HIV-infected  adults,  the  median  HIV  viral  load  set-point  was 36,000 copies/mL (range: 200-717,000 copies/ml) at 120 days after HIV infection [81]) because of host and viral factors (Table 27-2), and a higher viral set-point predicts more rapid disease progression [82, 83].

Rarely, patients may have pancreatitis  or  hepatitis.  In  contrast,  advanced  HIV  infection  commonly involves the gastrointestinal tract, with the main syndromes being esophageal disease and chronic diarrhea (Box 3.5). The causes of organ-specific disease in HIV-infected patients can usually be attributed to one of three causes: due to HIV infection itself; due to opportunistic  infection;  or  due  to  the  medications  used  to  treat  HIV  or prevent its complications [21]. The etiologies vary depending on the degree of immunosuppression.\\nChronic  diarrhea  is  a  common  problem  in  patients  with  AIDS, causing significant morbidity and mortality. While the CD4 cell count is preserved, the causes are similar to those in patients without HIV. As the infection becomes more advanced, parasitic, fungal and viral infections become more prevalent. Many of these pathogens can also be identified in AIDS patients without diarrhea, showing that asymptomatic  infection  is  common.  Workup  should  include  stool  specimens for bacterial culture and ova and parasite examinations. If these\\nare unrevealing, flexible sigmoidoscopy with biopsy may be helpful in the diagnosis, especially in  the identification of cytomegalovirus infection. Treatment should be directed at the specific enteric pathogen identified and antiretroviral therapy, which is the only treatment for some infections such as cryptosporidiosis and microsporidiosis, should be initiated.\\nIn a substantial proportion of AIDS patients with diarrhea, no enteric pathogens are isolated. Small intestinal biopsy specimens from these patients are notable for villous atrophy and lymphocytic infiltration into  the  lamina  propria.  This  idiopathic  condition  is  named  AIDS enteropathy,  and  may  represent  the  mucosal  response  to  atypical pathogens, including HIV.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

She was treated empirically with ceftriaxone and metronidazole for suspected pyogenic liver abscesses but showed no clinical improvement.\\n---\\n[ACUTE HEPATITIS]\\nContent: Characteristically, there are four phases of viral hepatitis. After exposure, the virus incubates for  from 2-6 weeks for HAV and HEV, and from 4-10 weeks for HBV and HCV [4, 22]. Then there may be  a prodromal  illness ,  characterized  by  fever,  chills,  headache,  fatigue, malaise, rash, arthritis, right upper quadrant pain and a tender liver. Several days later and often coincident with an improvement in systemic  symptoms ,  the  patient  will  have  more  pronounced  anorexia, nausea, vomiting, weight loss and right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Jaundice is usual and may persist for several weeks in association with dark urine, light (clay-colored) stools, and pruritus [2, 25, 26]. Often, the patient feels better following the onset of jaundice. Most  symptoms  of  viral  hepatitis  abate  within  1-3  weeks.  Acute HCV  infections  are  usually  anicteric  and  are  often  not  diagnosed. During  outbreaks  of  HAV,  and  particularly  HEV,  there  are  many asymptomatic, mild and anicteric cases. As the acute hepatitis continues to convalesce , the patient may, or may not, remain icteric, but they almost always have anorexia, nausea, weight loss, and, if they smoke cigarettes, lose their taste for smoking. Patients infected with HAV or  HEV are more likely to have intestinal symptoms, while  those  with  HBV  infections  may  have  rash,  arthralgias  and arthritis [2].\\n---\\n[SYMPTOMS]\\nContent: - Fever, fatigue, chills, sweats, headache, myalgia, anorexia, non-productive cough, arthralgia and nausea\\n- Less common: emotional lability and depression, hyperesthesia, sore throat, abdominal pain, conjunctival injection, photophobia and weight loss\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

In women, lesions of the cervix may masquerade as cervical carcinoma and pelvic lesions can mimic pelvic  cancers,  including  the  development  of  hydronephrosis.  The clinical  picture  of  congenitally  transmitted  donovanosis  is  unusual and appears to result from infectious material being squeezed into the external  auditory meatus during  birth. Involvement of the ears and  local  nodes  has  been  reported  several  times  and  may  take  a number of weeks to appear.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS]\\nContent: Subcutaneous  swelling  is  firm,  movable  and  well-defined;  satellite lesions may be palpable at the advancing margins [12].\\nThe  overlying  skin  is  usually  intact  and  may  be  tense,  edematous, hyperpigmented  or  normal  in  color. Ulceration occurs but is uncommon, and pain and tenderness are usually absent. Any part of the body may be affected, but the most common sites are the limbs, buttocks, and neck. Regional lymph nodes are rarely affected.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Cutaneous anthrax\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is cutaneous anthrax, caused by Bacillus anthracis. This was confirmed by multiple laboratory findings: blood cultures grew gram-positive rods, a skin biopsy demonstrated abundant bacilli positive for B. anthracis antigens by immunohistochemistry, and convalescent serology was positive for antibodies to protective antigen. The diagnosis was supported by the epidemiological context of his occupation as a postal worker handling contaminated mail during a bioterrorism event.\\nVitals: On examination, his temperature was 36.9 °C (98.4 °F), pulse was 118 bpm, blood pressure was 138/90mmHg, and respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute.\\nContent: The patient presented with a non-pruritic papule on his neck that evolved over two days, associated with significant non-painful swelling and a sensation of pressure. He denied fever but reported at least one episode of diaphoresis with mild confusion and headache. He recalled a break in the skin from shaving at the lesion site three days before symptom onset. After an initial clinic visit 24 hours prior where he was given a cephalosporin, he returned due to worsening malaise, increased neck swelling, and mild difficulty breathing.\\n---\\n[ULCERS/VERRUCOUS PLAQUES]\\nContent: Many diseases begin as an ulcer and later develop into a verrucous or warty plaque. Tuberculosis primarily affects the lung, although it can occasionally primarily involve the skin. Following direct inoculation into skin,  a  firm,  red-brown  papule may  develop which  ultimately ulcerates  into  a  chancre  and  is  covered  by  a  dark,  adherent  crust. Sometimes  the bacteria-rich ulcer is associated with erythema nodosum and may eventually spontaneously heal.\\nTuberculosis verrucosa cutis occurs by direct contact. A papule forming a verrucous plaque with centrifugal progression and central scarring is typical.\\nScrofula and scrofuloderma result when there is contiguous spread from underlying necrotic tuberculoid lymph nodes. The neck is the most common site of involvement. A firm, deep, adherent, purple-red nodule  may  become  fluctuant,  suppurate  or  ulcerate,  and  form  a fistula. Less commonly, self-inoculation near natural orifices can lead to tuberculosis cutis orificialis that appears as yellow-red nodules in or near the mucosa. These lesions frequently ulcerate and are tender.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: After an incubation period of 3-7 days, a rapidly eroding genital ulcer develops. About 50% of chancroid ulcers are classic and present as irregular, non-indurated, very painful lesions of variable depth with an undermined edge and  yellow-gray  purulent  exudative  base  that bleeds readily. The skin surrounding the ulcer is usually not inflamed. Other presentations include: giant ulcers formed when several smaller ones merge (Fig. 51.1); dwarf ulcers, which are tiny, shallow, round ulcers  that  mimic  genital  herpes;  transient  superficial  ulcers  that resemble  lymphogranuloma  venereum;  single,  painless  ulcers  that can  be  confused  with  syphilis;  and  beefy,  raised  indurated  lesions that clinically appear to be granuloma inguinale. The sensitivity and specificity of the clinical diagnosis depends on the relative proportion of genital ulcers caused by H. ducreyi in the population [12].\\nFIGURE 51.1 Chancr oi d .

(Courtesy of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Photograph Neg.

Kissing lesions are common on adjacent cutaneous surfaces. In women, the majority of lesions are on the fourchette, labia and perineal area (Fig. 51.2). About 40% of patients develop painful inguinal adenitis that can progress to bubo formation with overlying erythema; buboes may rupture and produce an inguinal abscess.\\nCareful, definitive laboratory studies suggest  that about 10-15% of patients  with  chancroid  also  have  a  second  ulcerating  pathogen, usually either herpes simplex or Treponema pallidum .\\nTwo recent reports, both from the South Pacific Islands, have identified H. ducreyi in children presenting with chronic cutaneous infections [13, 14].\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

She also reports vulval irritation, mild dysuria, and discomfort in her lower abdomen. What is the most likely cause of these symptoms?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS]\\nContent: Clinicians  often  manage  symptomatic  women  who  present  with some combination of vaginal discharge, vulvar irritation, and odor. The clinical and laboratory features that assist in differentiating trichomoniasis from bacterial vaginosis and candidiasis are presented in Table 95-1. A history of contact with a new partner supports the diagnosis of sexually transmitted vaginitis. Odor without much irritation is more consistent with bacterial vaginosis than with trichomoniasis, in  which irritation  is more prominent. After completing the physical  examination,  it  is  useful  to  determine  the  pH  of  vaginal secretions. This is conveniently accomplished by inserting a strip of indicator paper into the vaginal discharge pooled in the lower lip of the speculum. Normal vaginal pH of 4.7 or less is maintained in most patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis. Vaginal pH is elevated above 4.7 in most women with trichomoniasis, but an elevated pH is also found in most women with bacterial vaginosis and is not specific. The pH of vaginal material may be artifactually elevated if contaminated with cervical discharge or semen. After the pH has been determined, several drops of 10% to 20% potassium hydroxide should be added to the discharge in the speculum. The clinician then seeks the elaboration of a pungent, fishy, amine-like odor. This positive result of the whiff test is manifested by 75% of women with trichomoniasis but also by most women with bacterial vaginosis. The whiff test is not positive in vulvovaginal candidiasis. Such point-of-care testing is particularly useful in resource-poor venues [15].\\nDefinitive  diagnosis  is  based  on  demonstrating  the  parasite  (Fig. 95.1). A swab of vaginal material can be agitated in about 1 mL of saline and a drop transferred to a microscope slide to which a coverslip  is  then  applied.  This  wet  mount  is  observed  at  400 × with  the substage condenser racked down and the substage diaphragm closed. Its sensitivity for trichomoniasis is only about 60%. T. vaginalis culture systems are commercially available but expensive. Diagnosis in men is difficult and depends on newer molecular techniques [16]. The Pap smear can detect trichomonal infection, but the Gram stain is useless.\\n---\\n[PHYSICAL EXAMINATION]\\nContent: The  vulva  is  erythematous  in  less  than  one-third  of  patients.  On speculum examination, excessive discharge is noted in 50% to 75% of infected women. A yellow vaginal discharge suggests trichomoniasis, but the classically yellow or green, frothy discharge is seen in only a minority of patients. Indeed, bubbles are present in only 8% to 50% of  infected  women  in  various  series,  and  since  bubbles  are  also observed in bacterial vaginosis, their presence is nonspecific [9].\\nVaginal wall erythema, occasionally with edema, is observed in 20% to  75%  of  cases,  and  punctate  hemorrhages  are  observed  on  the vaginal  walls  or  the  exocervix  (strawberry  cervix)  in  about  2%  of women during routine physical examination, but the  characteristic hemorrhages are visualized in 45% by colposcopy.\\nIn my experience, mild adnexal tenderness is occasionally elicited on bimanual examination. This may be due to pelvic adenitis induced by the infection, but its presence should raise concerns for coincident salpingitis.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Cutaneous  irritation  in  the  perianal  region  is  the  most  prominent clinical feature. Local symptoms vary from a mild tickling sensation to pain [3]. Symptoms tend to be most troublesome at night and can produce  sleep  disturbances  and  restlessness. Pruritus  ani results  in scratching and trauma to the skin, and can lead to secondary bacterial infection. The eosinophil count in persons with E. vermicularis infection is usually normal.\\nE . vermicularis is  a  well-recognized cause of vulvovaginitis in prepubertal girls. It has also been incriminated as a potential cause of secondary enuresis  and  urinary  tract  infection.  Peritoneal  granulomas secondary  to  migrating E.  vermicularis have  been  associated  with abdominal  pain  in  adult  women.  More  commonly,  peritoneal nodules  are  found  incidentally  at  the  time  of  laparotomy  (Fig. 107.1B).\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Stevens-Johnson syndrome\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), a severe drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction. This clinical diagnosis is based on the patient's generalized maculopapular rash with extensive mucous membrane involvement (oral, conjunctival, genital), which appeared approximately four weeks after starting nevirapine and co-trimoxazole, both of which are highly implicated drugs. The diagnosis is further supported by the much higher incidence of SJS in HIV-positive individuals. Infectious causes like malaria were ruled out with negative testing.\\nVitals: Temperature is 37.7°C (99.9°F), blood pressure is 120/68 mmHg, pulse is 90 bpm, and respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute.\\nContent: The patient developed a productive cough with whitish sputum, followed one day later by a generalized skin rash that started on her trunk and spread to the extremities and mucosal membranes. Over the past two days, she also developed a sore throat and dysuria. The rash involves her lips, oral mucosa, conjunctivae, and genital mucosa, and has made talking and eating difficult and painful.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Spinal cord schistosomiasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The patient was diagnosed with spinal cord schistosomiasis complicating an infection with Schistosoma haematobium. The diagnosis was established based on the clinical presentation of a conus syndrome, a clear exposure history of swimming in Lake Malawi, the prior identification of S. haematobium eggs in his urine, significant peripheral eosinophilia, and characteristic MRI findings of a lesion in the conus medullaris and bladder wall thickening. His complete recovery following treatment with praziquantel and corticosteroids further supports the diagnosis.\\nVitals: He has normal vital signs; specific values were not reported.\\nContent: For three weeks, the patient experienced progressive difficulty urinating, requiring increasing abdominal pressure and only being able to pass small amounts at a time, associated with lower abdominal discomfort, abnormal sensations in the groins and genitals, and some erectile dysfunction. He also reports that walking did not feel normal, though he could not specify the abnormality. He denies weakness, dysaesthesia, or loss of sensation in his legs, and has no backache. Over the past two months, he had an unintentional weight loss of 8kg and fatigue without fever or night sweats. One week prior to presentation, he noticed a single episode of reddish urine discoloration without painful micturition or fever, for which he was treated at a local clinic.

Although trench fever often results in prolonged disability, it is rarely fatal.\\n---\\n[SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS]\\nContent: Typically, the disease begins with the abrupt onset of intense headache, fever, chills, and myalgia. Fever often exceeds 40°C (103°F) and is preceded by rigors. Muscle pain can be excruciating and occurs most commonly in the thighs, calves, lumbosacral region, and abdomen. Abdominal  wall  pain  accompanied  by  palpation  tenderness  can mimic an acute surgical abdomen. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and sore throat are other frequent symptoms. Cough and chest pain figure prominently in reports of patients from Korea and China.\\nConjunctival suffusion is a helpful diagnostic clue that usually appears two  or  three  days  after  the  onset  of  fever  and  involves  the  bulbar conjunctiva.  Pus  and  serous  secretions  are  absent  and  there  is  no matting  of  the  eyelashes  and  eyelids.  Mild  suffusion  can  easily  be overlooked. Less common and less distinctive signs include pharyngeal injection, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and skin  lesions.  Within  a  week,  most  patients  become  asymptomatic. After several days of apparent recovery, the illness resumes in some individuals. Manifestations of the second stage are more variable and mild than those of the initial illness and usually last 2-4 days. Leptospires  disappear  from  the  blood,  cerebrospinal  fluid  (CSF),  and tissues, but appear in the urine. Serum antibody titers rise - hence the term  'immune'  phase.  Meningitis  is  the  hallmark  of  this  stage  of leptospirosis. Pleocytosis of the CSF can be demonstrated in 80-90% of all patients during the second week of illness, although only about 50% will have clinical signs and symptoms of meningitis. Meningeal signs can last several weeks, but usually resolve within a day or two. Uveitis  is  a  late  manifestation  of  leptospirosis,  generally  seen  4-8 months after the illness has begun. The anterior uveal tract is most frequently affected and pain, photophobia, and blurring of vision are the usual symptoms.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Visceral leishmaniasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar), caused by a Leishmania protozoan.

I sustained multiple mosquito bites during the trip and, because it was planned last-minute, I didn't get my necessary vaccinations. For the past two days, I've been experiencing fevers, chills, muscle aches, and some vomiting. After I landed from my flight, I even had an episode where I threw up blood. When I was examined, the doctors noted I had a high fever, bleeding gums, and yellow skin and eyes. They also found that my liver and spleen were enlarged. I don't have any other existing health conditions. What is the most likely cause of these symptoms?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[UNCOMPLICATED MALARIA]\\nContent: Uncomplicated malaria illness  is  by  far the  most  common  clinical manifestation of a malaria infection and fever, or history of fever, is the most common symptom. There are no pathognomonic signs by which 'uncomplicated malaria' can be distinguished from common viral causes  of  fever  (Box  96.2).  The  presence  of  malaria  parasitemia increases the odds of a causal connection, especially in non-immune individuals, where peripheral parasitemia is nearly always associated with symptoms. Many semi-immune individuals (generally long-term residents  of  malaria-endemic  areas)  can  harbor  parasites  without becoming symptomatic and, in these individuals, peripheral blood parasitemia may well be 'incidental' to the symptoms [12]. In practical terms, symptomatic, parasitemic individuals who are alert enough to take oral medications are considered to have 'uncomplicated malaria' .\\nImportant  aspects  of  the  clinical  history  include  travel  itinerary, malaria precautions (chemoprophylaxis, use of bed nets and repellents) and recent prior treatment with anti-malarial drugs. The physical exam is useful for identifying other potential etiologies. In endemic areas,  the  presence  of  hepato-  or  splenomegaly  tilt  the  differential diagnosis  toward  malaria,  as  does  thrombocytopenia.  For  nonimmune travelers, the presence of fever, splenomegaly, hyperbilirubinemia and thrombocytopenia make malaria more likely [13].\\nCommon presenting signs are generalized constitutional symptoms including  fever,  chills,  dizziness,  backache,  myalgia,  malaise  and fatigue (frequently summarized as 'total body pain' by endemic-area adults). Gastrointestinal symptoms (i.e. anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea) can be prominent, causing confusion with  gastroenteritis.  Patients  may  have  nonproductive  cough  and dyspnea, consistent with acute respiratory infections. Young children and semi-immune adults may present with only fever and headache.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Following an incubation period of 2-6 days, most cases present with abrupt  onset  of  fever,  malaise,  myalgia  and  arthralgia.  A  high\\nFIGURE 33.7.1 Rift  Valley  fever  geographic distribution. Countries  highlighted in dark blue have periodic widespread epidemics of human and/ or  livestock  disease.  Countries  highlighted  in  mid-blue  have  occasional reports of Rift Valley fever virus infection.\\nproportion of patients report nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea;  symptoms can  clinically  resemble  other  acute  viral  infections, thus complicating early differential diagnosis [8]. (Fig. 33.7.2, Table 33.7-1). Upper respiratory signs are notably absent in Rift Valley fever cases. A small percentage of infected individuals (1-2%), may develop  jaundice,  hepatitis,  and/or  a  hemorrhagic  syndrome.  Case fatalities among hospitalized patients with coagulopathy range from 10-30%. In some patients, retinitis may develop with potential longterm sequelae including scotomas, other vision abnormalities or total blindness [9]. In the largest reported study of laboratory-confirmed hospitalized  patients  (n = 683,  Saudi  Arabia  2000-2001)  hemorrhagic complications included: thrombocytopenia (38.4%); hematemesis  (3.6%);  petechiae  (2.8%);  melena  (1.8%);  epistaxis  (1.2%); excessive  bleeding  from  puncture  sites  (2.4%);  and  disseminated intravascular coagulation with multiple organ dysfunction, including renal failure (7.5%) [10]. Laboratory abnormalities included marked elevations  of  serum  transaminases  [aspartate  transaminase  (AST), alanine  transaminase  (ALT),  gamma-glutamyl  transferase  (GGT)], lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) and creatinine with moderate-to-severe anemia and marked thrombocytopenia.  High  virus  loads  (mean  titer, > 1.0  X  10 6 plaque-forming units/mL  of  blood)  are  significantly  linked  to  fatal  outcomes  [1 1]. Resolution  of  the  acute  phase  can  be  followed  7-28  days  later  by delayed-onset encephalitis.\\n---\\n[FINAL DIAGNOSIS]\\nDisease: Yellow Fever\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was Yellow Fever, caused by a flavivirus, confirmed by a highly positive IgM capture ELISA for yellow fever (1:10000). This diagnosis aligned with his acute febrile illness, jaundice, bleeding, encephalopathy, seizures, liver failure, and occupation as a logger in an endemic Peruvian jungle area, coupled with his unvaccinated status. The sudden drop in liver transaminases prior to death was indicative of acute hepatic disintegration. Malaria, dengue, viral hepatitis, leptospirosis, typhoid fever, and brucellosis were effectively ruled out or deemed less likely based on specific negative tests and clinical course.\\nVitals: Temperature 38.8 °C (101.8 °C), blood pressure 110/70 mmHg, heart rate 110 beats per minute, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute.\\n---\\n[UNCOMPLICATED MALARIA]\\nContent: There are few specific symptoms or signs of malaria. Fever, or a history of fever, may be associated with nonspecific malaise, chills or rigors, respiratory symptoms, or gastrointestinal upset. A classic fever pattern, such as an every other day spike with P. vivax , is rarely seen. Practitioners should have a high index of suspicion for malaria in anyone who has returned from an endemic area in the last year: the minimum incubation  period  is  6  days.  Nearly  all  patients  with  falciparum malaria will present within 3 months of exposure and usually in the first month after return [2]. Presentation of infection by other species may occur later after exposure and can be delayed for over a year. In patients  with  a  history  of  fever,  the  presence  of  splenomegaly  or jaundice makes malaria  more likely  [3]  ;  hepatomegaly  or  splenomegaly are more common in children.\\nIndividuals who may have taken sub-optimal chemoprophylaxis regimens or were not completely adherent to their regimen may have a subacute,  or  even  insidious,  onset  of  clinical  symptoms.  They  may present  with atypical  symptoms [4-9] to include fatigue, low  back pain, nausea and anorexia, and depression. On occasion, these individuals will be afebrile. With long-acting drugs, such as mefloquine, atovaquone and choroquine-proguanil, the clinical presentation may be delayed by weeks after return. They often have very low and intermittent parasitemias, making conformation by microscopy difficult. In  addition,  patients  who  present  to  emergency  departments  with nonspecific febrile syndromes often get empirically treated with antibiotics such as azithromycin, tetracyclines, sulfa drugs and clindamycin,  that  have  significant  anti-malaria  activity.

She also recently experienced a miscarriage. Given her significant mosquito exposure in an endemic area, what could be causing these health issues?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[MALARIA IN PREGNANCY]\\nContent: The effects of malaria infection in pregnancy are visited on the expectant mother via peripheral parasitemia and on the fetus/newborn via parasite sequestration in the intervillous spaces of the placenta.\\nIn general, pregnant woman are more susceptible to malaria infection than their non-pregnant counterparts; this is most noticeable in areas of  low  transmission,  where  few  adults  have  acquired  anti-disease immunity. Susceptibility to infection decreases with each succeeding pregnancy.\\nThe placenta provides a new site for sequestration, a phenomenon unique  to  infections  with P.  falciparum ,  and,  as  with  peripheral\\nparasitemia, semi-immune women are less likely to have placental sequestration than non-immune women, and the placentae of multigravidae are less likely to contain evidence of parasite sequestration than those of primigravidae. The receptor on the syncytiotrophoblast lining the intervillous spaces of the placenta is chondroitin sulfate A, and binding is mediated by a specific variant surface antigen, var2csa [17].\\nClinical manifestations in the mother are determined by the extent of acquired immunity. In sub-Saharan Africa, where most studies have been  carried  out,  mild  febrile  illnesses  and  anemia  are  the  most common features. In relatively non-immune pregnant women, severe and complicated malaria, often characterized by hypoglycemia and pulmonary edema, can occur. Pregnancy-induced immune suppression generally results in more severe disease, especially in the group at highest risk, primigravid, non-immune women. Parasitemia rates are  at  their  highest  during  the  second  trimester,  and  the  period  of increased risk can extend into the post-partum period for 1-2 months [18].\\nAdverse  maternal  and  perinatal  outcomes  of  malaria  in  pregnancy include anemia, miscarriage, fetal growth restriction (small for gestational age), low birth weight ( < 2500 g at birth), pre-term births and congenital  infection.  Again,  the  likelihood  of  these  outcomes  is related  to  maternal  gravidity  and  degree  of  acquired  anti-malarial immunity.\\n---\\n[FEBRILE ILLNESSES]\\nContent: Priority  should  be  given  to  identifying  illnesses  that  can  be  fatal rapidly or pose a threat to public health. Delayed diagnosis of Plasmodium  falciparum malaria  can  be  lethal,  and  undiagnosed  TB  or measles can lead to secondary cases.\\nFever  soon  after  immigration  from  malarial  countries  could  be malaria; 90% of P. falciparum cases occur within 1 month of arrival. Fever with rash suggests dengue, while fever with rash and arthritis may  indicate  chikungunya  virus.  Early  fevers  may  also  be  due  to typhoid  and  paratyphoid  fevers,  rickettsial  infections,  and  amebic liver abscesses. Fever months after migration may be caused by TB, primary malarial infection, or relapse of P. vivax and P.  ovale. Many less  common infections can be associated with fever, though other accompanying  signs  and  symptoms  may  suggest  these  diagnoses. Other febrile illness with short incubation periods, such as influenza or meningococcemia, can occur in immigrants exposed after migration, but may be more relevant to returning travelers [8]. This chapter will focus on infectious diseases that can be seen by clinicians at any time following migration and that are likely to be related to the individual's country of origin or migration process.\\n---\\n[EXPOSURE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY]\\nDisease: Zika virus infection\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is Zika virus infection. This was confirmed by molecular and serological evidence, including a positive Zika virus RT-PCR in an early serum sample and subsequent documented seroconversion with a significant rise in Zika IgM and IgG antibody titers. The clinical presentation of rash, conjunctivitis, and peripheral oedema without fever was highly characteristic, and the travel history to an endemic region provided the epidemiological link.\\nVitals: The patient was afebrile. No other vital signs were reported.\\nContent: The patient had recently returned from a 2-week holiday to Guatemala and El Salvador, presenting 6 days after her return. Her clinical presentation and travel history are consistent with exposure to arboviruses, such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, which are endemic in Central and South America.\\n---\\n[EXPOSURE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY]\\nDisease: Bartonellosis (Oroya fever)\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is acute bartonellosis, also known as Oroya fever, caused by Bartonella bacilliformis. The diagnosis was definitively established by the thin blood film showing massive red blood cell infestation with cocco-bacillary structures characteristic of the organism. This was supported by the clinical presentation of severe haemolytic anaemia, fever, and neurologic impairment, along with a compatible exposure history in an endemic region of Peru. Malaria was ruled out by negative blood smears.\\nVitals: On admission, his blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg, pulse was 110 bpm and regular, temperature was 39.2 °C (102.6 °F), and respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute.\\nContent: The patient spent three weeks on vacation in a rural area in the highlands of northern Peru at an altitude of 2400m, three months prior to symptom onset. While there, he and his wife were bitten at night by tiny mosquitoes and used no personal protection. This region is endemic for sandflies, the vectors for bartonellosis. There was no reported animal contact.\\n---\\n[ARBOVIRUS]\\nContent: Dengue is the most prevalent arbovirus in travelers. Although widespread, it is a common cause of fever only in those returning from Asia, the Caribbean and South America [15]. Most travelers present with  a  febrile  illness  associated  with  headache,  retro-orbital  pain, myalgia, arthralgia (especially back pain) and rash [15]. The rash is initially erythrodermic, and becomes petechial with disease progression (Fig. 143.3). Hepatitis, myocarditis, encephalitis and neuropathy can  occur.  Bleeding  gums,  epistaxis  and  gastrointestinal  bleeding occur but are not necessarily indicative of dengue hemorrhagic fever, which like dengue shock syndrome is rare in travelers. Chikungunya is increasingly reported in returning travelers from the islands of the Indian Ocean, South and Southeast Asia [16]. The clinical presentation  is  similar  to  classic  dengue  fever;  however,  arthralgia  is  more prominent.  In  the  majority  of  cases,  the  arthralgia  settles;  5-30% develop chronic arthropathy with pain, stiffness and swelling lasting months to years [17,18].\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

Cases due to Cochliomyia hominivorax , Oestrus ovis , C. ruandae and C. rodhani have been seen [4].\\nTungiasis is caused by penetration of the gravid female sand flea Tunga penetrans , which burrows into the skin of its host, usually on the feet or a toe, where it appears as a slowly growing nodule. The infection is acquired via direct contact (e.g. bare feet) with infested soil or beach sand. Tungiasis (also called chigoe flea, jigger flea) is widely distributed throughout Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa and Asia up to the west coast of India [4].\\n---\\n[PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS [5]]\\nContent: The evaluation of fever in returned travelers requires an understanding of the epidemiologic factors which influence exposure to specific pathogens. These factors are reflected in the travel history and include geographic  destinations  visited,  dates  of  particular  risk  exposures, time  of  onset  and  duration  of  symptoms.  The  first  two  determine which infections the traveler may have been exposed to and the last two  allow  for  an  estimation  of  the  incubation  period  (see  Tables 143.1 & 143.2).\\nAs can be seen from Figure 143.1, the travel history is vital for determining the likely diagnosis, as many infections can have similar clinical presentations. Certain symptoms and signs may give further clues; relevant examination findings include rash, eschar, hepatosplenomegaly and jaundice (see Tables 143-3, 143-4 & 143-5). Table 143-6 lists  the  differential  diagnosis  in  patients  with  chronic  fever  ( > 2 weeks), and is a reminder that noninfectious causes of fever are seen in this group.\\nTravelers presenting with undifferentiated fever should have a number of initial recommended investigations performed (see Table 143-7). Following this, specific investigations may be appropriate, depending on the differential diagnosis (see Table 143-8). Where tuberculosis is considered, it is essential that adequate samples of sputum or tissue for  mycobacteria  culture  are  obtained.  Tuberculin  skin  tests  and interferon-gamma release assays have a limited role in evaluation of patients with chronic fever.\\nRarely, fever in the returned traveler may be due to a viral hemorrhagic fever such as Lassa, Ebola, Marburg or Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever.  The  diagnosis  should  be  considered  in  travelers  who  have visited endemic regions within 21 days of symptom onset [29,30], in particular, travel to rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa (particularly West Africa); contact with suspected cases, healthcare facilities, rats or wild animals  raises  the  index  of  suspicion.  Symptoms  and  signs  vary according to pathogen, with bleeding in  advanced  cases.  Although rare, these infections can be severe and have implications for nosocomial transmission. Malaria must be excluded; however, PCR of blood may be required, before further investigations (which might result in exposure of healthcare staff) are performed.

This is based on the chronic, progressive spastic paraparesis with a thoracic sensory level in a patient from a TB-endemic region who is also HIV-positive. The diagnosis is strongly supported by the spinal radiograph showing collapse of the T11 vertebral body and a paravertebral soft tissue mass, which are characteristic findings. Schistosomiasis was ruled out with negative stool and urine tests, and the insidious onset made acute transverse myelitis less likely.\\nVitals: On a visit three months after symptom onset, his temperature was slightly elevated at 37.5 °C (99.5 °F).

In travelers and migrants, a careful residence or travel history can help establish the diagnosis of schistosomiasis [31, 33]. In several sub-Saharan areas, both S. mansoni and S. haematobium, and even S. intercalatum, can be contracted. The patient who has lived in,\\n877\\nor  visited,  endemic  areas  must  be  asked  about  skin  contact  with freshwater of any kind, even if considered locally as safe or snail-free. Contacts of any type or duration can lead to infection. The patient may, or may not, report itching or rash shortly after the water contact. Visual  inspection  may help  diagnose  'swimmers'  itch'  after  recent exposure.\\nA medical history may reveal intermittent symptoms since the potential exposure, including flu-like syndromes in the weeks or months thereafter. Malaise, fatigue,  muscle pains, appetite loss, intermittent diarrhea, vague abdominal pain and red or dark urine are potential warning signs - partly depending on the suspected species. A neurologic history and examination is performed to exclude early cerebrospinal involvement.

He did report having a skin lesion on his left upper thigh which he had covered with a plaster.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Rabies\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was paralytic rabies, caused by the rabies lyssavirus. This was confirmed by the detection of rabies viral RNA through RT-PCR in a saliva sample collected at admission. The diagnosis was strongly supported by the patient's history of a WHO category III stray dog bite in a rabies-endemic country, the rapidly progressive febrile quadriparesis, the development of autonomic instability, and the critical omission of rabies immunoglobulin during post-exposure prophylaxis. The clinical course and confirmatory laboratory test ruled out other neurological conditions considered in the differential.\\nVitals: On admission, his blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, pulse 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute, and temperature 38.5°C (101.3°F).\\nContent: A 20-year-old man presented with fever for 4 days, followed by tingling and weakness that began in his left leg and then rapidly progressed to involve all four limbs over the next 2 days. The onset of symptoms occurred about one month after a stray dog bite. After admission, he developed autonomic instability, evidenced by increased perspiration and significant variability in heart rate and blood pressure. He also developed dysphagia and respiratory distress, requiring mechanical ventilation on the third day after hospitalization. The patient died due to sudden cardiac arrest on the fifth day of hospitalization, which was nine days post-onset of symptoms.\\n---\\n[TRENCH FEVER]\\nContent: Trench  fever  is  an  acute  disease  characterized  by  sudden  onset  of high-grade fever, headaches, dizziness, and a characteristic pain in the shins. Dizziness and headaches are sometime so sudden that soldiers have been known to fall over in the trenches. Other symptoms include post-orbital  pain  (typically  exacerbated by movement), pain in  the lower limbs and back, constipation, a rash on the face, and a loss of appetite [12]. The first episode of fever may last 2-4 days and may be followed  by  relapses  every  4-6  days,  giving  rise  to  trench  fever's\\nFIGURE  67. 1 Body  louse,  a  vector  for B.  quintana ,  sucking  blood  on  a homeless patient.\\nFIGURE 67. 2 Pediculosis and super infection in a homeless man seeking care during a snapshot intervention in shelters.

This is based on the chronic, progressive spastic paraparesis with a thoracic sensory level in a patient from a TB-endemic region who is also HIV-positive. The diagnosis is strongly supported by the spinal radiograph showing collapse of the T11 vertebral body and a paravertebral soft tissue mass, which are characteristic findings. Schistosomiasis was ruled out with negative stool and urine tests, and the insidious onset made acute transverse myelitis less likely.\\nVitals: On a visit three months after symptom onset, his temperature was slightly elevated at 37.5 °C (99.5 °F). Upon admission to the tertiary hospital, he was afebrile with normal vital signs.\\nContent: The illness began one year prior with back pain. Over the following weeks, he developed difficulty walking and a 'pins and needles' sensation in his legs. Three months after onset, he presented to a health centre with a temperature of 37.5 °C and was given antimalarials and praziquantel. He also consulted a traditional healer. His condition progressively deteriorated over the next six months, eventually leaving him bedridden. The patient denies constitutional symptoms such as fever, night sweats, weight loss, or chronic cough. He has no haematuria or diarrhoea and is continent for stool and urine.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

This was confirmed by the presence of a high load of S. stercoralis rhabditiform larvae in both stool (via Baermann testing) and respiratory secretions, following initial suspicion from a duodenal biopsy. The diagnosis is supported by the clinical presentation of severe chronic diarrhoea and wasting, the patient's origin from an endemic area for both pathogens, confirmed HTLV-1 co-infection (a known risk factor for hyperinfection), and the excellent clinical and parasitological response to ivermectin therapy.\\nVitals: The patient was afebrile on examination. No other vital signs were reported.\\nContent: A 34-year-old male immigrant from northern Peru, living in Chile for 9 years. He is described as cachectic with a BMI of 17. His HIV test was negative. There is a significant family history where his mother and one brother suffered from chronic abdominal symptoms of unknown origin, leading to wasting and death at ages 45 and 28, respectively.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Persistent infection in immunocompromised persons may progress from  asymptomatic  to  symptomatic  as  immune  status  declines. Biliary tract  involvement  may  lead  to  clinical  cholangitis  [16] and respiratory disease, to mild hypoxia and shortness of breath [13, 16]. Respiratory infection has been considered a rare HIV/AIDS complication, but recent data suggest it may be common in normal children with enteric infection, suggesting that respiratory transmission may  occur.  In  persons  with  HIV/AIDS,  cryptosporidiosis  causes increased mortality and shortened survival [22]. In people with the cholera-like form of the disease characterized by massive fluid loss, severe  abdominal  pain,  malabsorption,  anorexia  and  significant weight loss, survival may only be for days or several weeks. To summarize, variations in immune status and the extent and sites of infection contribute to differences in disease severity and survival [17, 18], as may the species of the parasite [1 1].\\n---\\n[HIV AND THE LIVER 8TABLE 4-59]\\nContent: The majority of people infected with HIV live in the lower-income world (see Chapter 27). HIV is associated with a number of specific diseases of the liver related to immunosuppression, immune reconstitution and drug effects. Broadly, the spectrum of liver disease relates to  CD4  count  and  antiretroviral  therapy  (ART)  exposure.  In  areas where ART is available, the burden of disease has shifted from opportunistic  infection  and  malignancy  to  chronic  diseases,  with  liver disease related to viral hepatitis becoming a leading cause of morbidity and mortality [30]. Chronic viral hepatitis and HIV co-infection is associated with reduced spontaneous clearance and accelerated progression of viral hepatitis to cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma [31]. However, in those who do not have access to ART, opportunistic infection and malignancy are still prevalent. Most conditions associated with liver disease are systemic and have  spread  hematogenously  from  other  sites  to  involve  the  liver. These can be stratified by CD4 count, as most serious opportunistic infections  (OIs)  occur  with  severe  immunodeficiency  (CD4 < 100 cells/ μ L).  However,  tuberculosis,  non-Hodgkin  lymphoma  (NHL)\\n---\\n[KEY FEATURES]\\nContent: - Hepatobiliary abnormalities are common in resource limited and tropical settings\\n- Liver disease can be divided into: 'pre-hepatic', involving the portal vein or hepatic artery; 'hepatic', involving the parenchymal lobule, including hepatocytes, biliary and vascular sinusoids; and 'post-hepatic', involving the hepatic vein or biliary systems\\n- Characterizing liver abnormalities involves a combination of clinical, biochemical, serologic, microbiologic, radiologic and histologic investigations\\n- Hepatitis is common, and most frequently due to viral infections and toxins\\n- Parasitic infection of the liver may be seen during echinococcosis, schistosomiasis and liver *uke infection, among other processes\\n- Many tropical diseases may result in cholestasis and jaundice, through varied mechanisms\\n- Focal liver diseases may be due to infection or neoplasia\\n- Hepatitis B and hepatitis C can lead to chronic liver disease, especially in setting of HIV co-infection\\n- Chronic liver disease can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, and cancer\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: The  course  of  HEV  infection  is  similar  to  that  of  hepatitis  A.  The incubation  period  averages  40  days  (range  15-60  days).  After  oral inoculation, the virus principally replicates in the liver and produces cytopathic  changes.  HEV  can  be  detected  in  stool  and  blood  3-4 weeks after ingestion, prior to the onset of symptoms, and for 1-2 weeks afterwards. Like hepatitis A, there are many more asymptomatic and anicteric infections with HEV than diagnosed cases of acute viral hepatitis.  Children  often  have  asymptomatic,  anicteric  infections, while the clinical attack rate is higher in the 15-40 year age group, and severity of illness increases with age.\\nSymptoms and signs are similar to those caused by other types of viral hepatitis: malaise, fatigue,  anorexia,  nausea  and  vomiting, jaundice and dark urine, abdominal pain, fever and hepatomegaly. The most common  laboratory  findings  include  elevated  bilirubin,  ALT,  AST, and alkaline phosphatase. Histopathologic findings in biopsies from patients with HEV hepatitis have included both cholestatic hepatitis and classic acute viral hepatitis changes.\\nClinical  symptoms,  hyperbilirubinemia  and  elevated  aminotransferase levels generally resolve 1-6 weeks after onset of illness. Jaundice may be prolonged with HEV infection, which may also cause fulminant hepatitis; 10-20% of pregnant women in the third trimester who are hospitalized with acute HEV infection during outbreaks in India were  reported  to  have  fatal  fulminant  hepatitis  [107,  108].  HEV very  rarely  causes  chronic  infection  in  immunosuppressed  patients [109, 1 10].\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

Toxin-induced  secretory  diarrhea  continues  independent  of  food intake. Malabsorption of carbohydrate in the small intestine leads to fermentation of unabsorbed substrates by colonic bacteria; this may cause bloating, the passage of much rectal gas and frothy stools, which are all characteristic of giardiasis. Cryptosporidiosis can involve both small and large bowel, causing short-lived and self-limiting diarrhea; however, the infection can be prolonged in patients with impaired immune responses. Cyclospora cayetanensis can also cause  acute and more chronic diarrhea with abnormalities of intestinal absorption.\\nFrequent  bowel  movements  with  small  volumes  of  stool  and  the passage  of  blood  and  mucus  suggest  colonic  infection.  Causes  of bloody diarrhea (dysentery) include invasive bacteria such as Campylobacter spp., enterohemorrhagic E. coli , and Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia spp.; nonbacterial causes include Entamoeba histolytica (amebic dysentery) and Balantidium coli , which is spread by close contact with pigs. Colicky abdominal pain is common in many gut infections and is especially severe in campylobacteriosis and yersiniosis, mimicking acute appendicitis.

The patient's rapid clinical improvement on doxycycline therapy further supported the diagnosis.\\nVitals: On presentation, after taking 1g of paracetamol, his tympanic temperature was 37.5 °C (99.5 °F), pulse was 80 bpm, and blood pressure was 130/70 mmHg.\\nContent: A 52-year-old man presented to a tropical medicine clinic with a two-day history of fever, night sweats, and a frontal headache. The symptoms began ten days after he returned from a trip to South Africa. He denied any joint pains and had not noticed a rash. He did report having a skin lesion on his left upper thigh which he had covered with a plaster.\\n---\\n[SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS]\\nContent: Typically, the disease begins with the abrupt onset of intense headache, fever, chills, and myalgia. Fever often exceeds 40°C (103°F) and is preceded by rigors. Muscle pain can be excruciating and occurs most commonly in the thighs, calves, lumbosacral region, and abdomen. Abdominal  wall  pain  accompanied  by  palpation  tenderness  can mimic an acute surgical abdomen. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and sore throat are other frequent symptoms. Cough and chest pain figure prominently in reports of patients from Korea and China.\\nConjunctival suffusion is a helpful diagnostic clue that usually appears two  or  three  days  after  the  onset  of  fever  and  involves  the  bulbar conjunctiva.  Pus  and  serous  secretions  are  absent  and  there  is  no matting  of  the  eyelashes  and  eyelids.  Mild  suffusion  can  easily  be overlooked. Less common and less distinctive signs include pharyngeal injection, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and skin  lesions.  Within  a  week,  most  patients  become  asymptomatic. After several days of apparent recovery, the illness resumes in some individuals. Manifestations of the second stage are more variable and mild than those of the initial illness and usually last 2-4 days. Leptospires  disappear  from  the  blood,  cerebrospinal  fluid  (CSF),  and tissues, but appear in the urine. Serum antibody titers rise - hence the term  'immune'  phase.  Meningitis  is  the  hallmark  of  this  stage  of leptospirosis. Pleocytosis of the CSF can be demonstrated in 80-90% of all patients during the second week of illness, although only about 50% will have clinical signs and symptoms of meningitis. Meningeal signs can last several weeks, but usually resolve within a day or two. Uveitis  is  a  late  manifestation  of  leptospirosis,  generally  seen  4-8 months after the illness has begun. The anterior uveal tract is most frequently affected and pain, photophobia, and blurring of vision are the usual symptoms.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Rabies\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was paralytic rabies, caused by the rabies lyssavirus. This was confirmed by the detection of rabies viral RNA through RT-PCR in a saliva sample collected at admission. The diagnosis was strongly supported by the patient's history of a WHO category III stray dog bite in a rabies-endemic country, the rapidly progressive febrile quadriparesis, the development of autonomic instability, and the critical omission of rabies immunoglobulin during post-exposure prophylaxis. The clinical course and confirmatory laboratory test ruled out other neurological conditions considered in the differential.\\nVitals: On admission, his blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, pulse 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute, and temperature 38.5°C (101.3°F).\\nContent: A 20-year-old man presented with fever for 4 days, followed by tingling and weakness that began in his left leg and then rapidly progressed to involve all four limbs over the next 2 days. The onset of symptoms occurred about one month after a stray dog bite. After admission, he developed autonomic instability, evidenced by increased perspiration and significant variability in heart rate and blood pressure. He also developed dysphagia and respiratory distress, requiring mechanical ventilation on the third day after hospitalization. The patient died due to sudden cardiac arrest on the fifth day of hospitalization, which was nine days post-onset of symptoms.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Spinal tuberculosis (Pott's disease)\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is presumed spinal tuberculosis (Pott's disease). This is based on the chronic, progressive spastic paraparesis with a thoracic sensory level in a patient from a TB-endemic region who is also HIV-positive. The diagnosis is strongly supported by the spinal radiograph showing collapse of the T11 vertebral body and a paravertebral soft tissue mass, which are characteristic findings. Schistosomiasis was ruled out with negative stool and urine tests, and the insidious onset made acute transverse myelitis less likely.\\nVitals: On a visit three months after symptom onset, his temperature was slightly elevated at 37.5 °C (99.5 °F). Upon admission to the tertiary hospital, he was afebrile with normal vital signs.\\nContent: The illness began one year prior with back pain. Over the following weeks, he developed difficulty walking and a 'pins and needles' sensation in his legs. Three months after onset, he presented to a health centre with a temperature of 37.5 °C and was given antimalarials and praziquantel. He also consulted a traditional healer. His condition progressively deteriorated over the next six months, eventually leaving him bedridden. The patient denies constitutional symptoms such as fever, night sweats, weight loss, or chronic cough. He has no haematuria or diarrhoea and is continent for stool and urine.\\n---\\n[TRENCH FEVER]\\nContent: Trench  fever  is  an  acute  disease  characterized  by  sudden  onset  of high-grade fever, headaches, dizziness, and a characteristic pain in the shins. Dizziness and headaches are sometime so sudden that soldiers have been known to fall over in the trenches. Other symptoms include post-orbital  pain  (typically  exacerbated by movement), pain in  the lower limbs and back, constipation, a rash on the face, and a loss of appetite [12]. The first episode of fever may last 2-4 days and may be followed  by  relapses  every  4-6  days,  giving  rise  to  trench  fever's\\nFIGURE  67. 1 Body  louse,  a  vector  for B.  quintana ,  sucking  blood  on  a homeless patient.\\nFIGURE 67. 2 Pediculosis and super infection in a homeless man seeking care during a snapshot intervention in shelters.

Fever may gradually increase over the first week of illness. Headache, anorexia, malaise, and other nonspecific,  flu-like  symptoms  are  common  and  may  precede  fever. Abdominal complaints  including  diarrhea,  constipation,  and  nonlocalizing abdominal pain each occur in less than a third of cases, but may raise clinical suspicion [16].\\nPhysical findings are also nonspecific. Relative bradycardia, or pulsetemperature dissociation, is considered a classic sign of enteric fever, but there is no widely accepted definition of relative bradycardia and little evidence that it is a useful predictor [17]. Rose spots are small, blanching pink macular lesions, typically 2-4 mm, that usually occur on the chest, abdomen and/or back during the second week of illness, but are infrequently observed. A white, yellow or brown coating of the tongue that spares the tongue's edges is common. Mild abdominal tenderness may be present.

For those with clinical disease, the incubation period is usually 3-6 days. In its mildest form, yellow fever is a self-limited infection characterized by acute onset of fever and headache. A subset of patients experience other symptoms, including chills, myalgias, lumbosacral pain, anorexia, nausea, vomiting and dizziness [3]. Physical examination may demonstrate  relative  bradycardia  in  relation  to  elevated  body temperature (Faget's sign). The patient is usually viremic during this period, which lasts for approximately 3 days. Most have an uneventful recovery but, in approximately 15% of cases, the illness recurs in a more  severe  form  within  48  hours  following  the  viremic  period. Symptoms  include  fever,  vomiting,  epigastric  pain,  jaundice,  renal insufficiency  and  cardiovascular  instability.  The  virus  is  generally absent from the blood during this phase of symptom recrudescence.

A  high\\nFIGURE 33.7.1 Rift  Valley  fever  geographic distribution. Countries  highlighted in dark blue have periodic widespread epidemics of human and/ or  livestock  disease.  Countries  highlighted  in  mid-blue  have  occasional reports of Rift Valley fever virus infection.\\nproportion of patients report nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea;  symptoms can  clinically  resemble  other  acute  viral  infections, thus complicating early differential diagnosis [8]. (Fig. 33.7.2, Table 33.7-1). Upper respiratory signs are notably absent in Rift Valley fever cases. A small percentage of infected individuals (1-2%), may develop  jaundice,  hepatitis,  and/or  a  hemorrhagic  syndrome.  Case fatalities among hospitalized patients with coagulopathy range from 10-30%. In some patients, retinitis may develop with potential longterm sequelae including scotomas, other vision abnormalities or total blindness [9]. In the largest reported study of laboratory-confirmed hospitalized  patients  (n = 683,  Saudi  Arabia  2000-2001)  hemorrhagic complications included: thrombocytopenia (38.4%); hematemesis  (3.6%);  petechiae  (2.8%);  melena  (1.8%);  epistaxis  (1.2%); excessive  bleeding  from  puncture  sites  (2.4%);  and  disseminated intravascular coagulation with multiple organ dysfunction, including renal failure (7.5%) [10]. Laboratory abnormalities included marked elevations  of  serum  transaminases  [aspartate  transaminase  (AST), alanine  transaminase  (ALT),  gamma-glutamyl  transferase  (GGT)], lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) and creatinine with moderate-to-severe anemia and marked thrombocytopenia.  High  virus  loads  (mean  titer, > 1.0  X  10 6 plaque-forming units/mL  of  blood)  are  significantly  linked  to  fatal  outcomes  [1 1].

During the next few days,  these  symptoms continue and may be  accompanied  by anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, photophobia and cough. The fever is typically high (39-41°C) and associated with a severe  frontal  headache.  Rash,  considered  the  hallmark  feature  of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, appears on day three of fever as small, pink,  blanching  macules  (typically  on  the  wrists,  ankles  and  forearms) that evolve maculopapules. Within 24 hours, it spreads centrally to involve the legs, buttocks, arms, axillae, trunk, neck and face. The entire body may be involved, including the mucous membranes of the palate and pharynx [1 1]. Characteristic of the rash are petechial lesions,  in  a  distribution  that  includes  the  palms  and  soles,  which occur in 36% to 82% of patients. In some severe cases, petechiae may coalesce to form large ecchymoses. No eschar at the inoculation site is visible. Severe manifestations may include pulmonary edema and hemorrhage, cerebral edema, myocarditis, renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and gangrene. Three factors are independent predictors of failure by the physician to initiate therapy the first time a patient is seen: absence of a rash, presentation between August 1 and April 30, and presentation within the first three days of illness. In untreated patients who survive their illness, the natural course of fever terminates after two to three weeks.\\n---\\n[FINAL DIAGNOSIS]\\nDisease: Yellow Fever\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was Yellow Fever, caused by a flavivirus, confirmed by a highly positive IgM capture ELISA for yellow fever (1:10000).

It  erupts  as  weals  with  visible puncta and progresses to papules surmounted by vesicles or bullae that may become excoriated and infected. It is associated with chronic superficial infestations by fleas (e.g. cat fleas Ctenocephalides felis ) and bedbugs (see below), and with bites by mosquitoes, mites and other arthropods [2, 3].\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Chikungunya is an acute infection of abrupt onset, heralded by fever and severe arthralgia, and followed by other constitutional symptoms and rash lasting for a period of 1-7 days. The incubation period is usually 2-3 days, with a range of 1-12 days. Fever rises abruptly, often reaching 39-40°C accompanied by intermittent shaking chills. This acute phase lasts 2-3 days. The temperature may remit for 1-2 days after a gap of 4-10 days, resulting in a 'saddle back' fever curve that is characteristic of arthropod-borne virus infections.\\nThe arthralgias are polyarticular, migratory and predominantly affect the small joints of the hands, wrists, ankles and feet (Fig. 32.2.2) with lesser involvement of larger joints. During the acute phase, patients complain bitterly of pain when asked to move. They characteristically lie still in the attitude of flexion. Pain on movement is worse in the morning, improved by mild exercise and exacerbated by strenuous exercise. Swelling may occur but fluid accumulation is uncommon. Patients with milder articular manifestation are usually symptom-free within a few weeks, but more severe cases require months to resolve entirely [1, 3]. A study indicated that over 12% of patients develop chronic joint symptoms. Generalized myalgias, as well as back and shoulder pain is common [4].\\nCutaneous  manifestations  are  typical  with  many  patients.  Initially, many present with facial and trunk flushing. This is usually followed by a maculopapular rash. The trunk and limbs are commonly involved (Fig. 32.2.3), but the face, palms and soles may also show lesions. The rash may simply fade or desquamate.

This was confirmed by serological testing showing a positive Mayaro IgM-IFA (1280 on 29 August, 40 on 12 September) and IgG-IFA (2560 on both dates) with a confirmatory plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) that rose from 40 to 160. The diagnosis aligns with the patient's travel history to the Amazon Basin, the preceding dengue-like febrile illness, and the characteristic prolonged symmetrical polyarthralgias primarily affecting small peripheral joints, while other common travel-related viral and bacterial causes were ruled out by serology.\\nVitals: No specific vital signs were reported other than the occurrence of an acute febrile illness with chills.\\nContent: During the second week of a 3.5-week trip to the Amazon Basin of northern Peru, the patient developed an acute febrile illness with chills, malaise, frontal headache, generalized myalgia, and a transient, non-pruritic maculopapular rash. The rash began on the forearms about 1 week after fever onset, spread to the trunk, neck, and face, and faded after 3 days. Slowly progressive, debilitating polyarthralgias affecting peripheral joints, with transient joint swelling, also developed. Painful cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy lasted for about 1 week. Fever and other acute symptoms subsided within 1 week, but polyarthralgias persisted, showing a symmetrical pattern mainly affecting the small joints of the hands and feet, wrists, ankles, and knees. Upon return to Switzerland a few weeks later, the patient reported stiffness of the affected joints, mainly in the morning and after immobility, and the joint pains did not improve for two more months.\\n---\\n[FOOT INFECTIONS]\\nContent: Athlete's  foot or  tinea  pedis  is  a  term  used  to  describe  scaling  and maceration accompanied by itching between the toes, particularly the fourth  interdigital  space.

In dermatophyte infections, the area between the toes may be wet or dry and, in some infections, particularly those caused by Trichophyton interdigitale , vesicular. Involvement of the dorsum of the foot or the sole may occur. The commonest cause is T. rubrum .\\nSymptoms may be minimal. It is more common in people who wear shoes and socks and is therefore associated with urban areas in the tropics.\\nTinea pedis in tropical areas must be distinguished from eczema and, less commonly, plantar psoriasis [4]. The interplay between bacteria and fungi is poorly understood but, in the tropics, secondary Gramnegative bacterial infection on top of interdigital dermatophytosis can occur.\\n---\\n[FIXED LOCALIZED PAPULES AND NODULES]\\nContent: There are several causes of fixed papules and nodules (Box 147.3). Myiasis  and  tungiasis  are  among  the  most  common.  Myiasis  is infestation of human tissue by larvae or maggots of flies ( Diptera ).

The initial diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis was confirmed by an AFB-positive fine-needle aspirate from a neck gland. The paradoxical IRIS was diagnosed clinically based on his worsening condition after starting ART, despite evidence of a good virologic and immunologic response. The superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis, likely with Staphylococcus aureus, was confirmed by the second aspirate showing purulent material with coccoid bacteria and the patient's rapid improvement following incision, drainage, and antibiotics.\\nVitals: On presentation, he was febrile with a temperature of 39.2 °C (102.56° F). His pulse was 112 bpm, respiratory rate was 28 breaths per minute, and he had a normal blood pressure.\\nContent: For six weeks, the patient has experienced a productive cough and chest pain, associated with systemic symptoms including weight loss, fevers, and night sweats. During this period, he also developed a painful swelling in his neck. He has no other reported symptoms.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Stevens-Johnson syndrome\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), a severe drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction. This clinical diagnosis is based on the patient's generalized maculopapular rash with extensive mucous membrane involvement (oral, conjunctival, genital), which appeared approximately four weeks after starting nevirapine and co-trimoxazole, both of which are highly implicated drugs. The diagnosis is further supported by the much higher incidence of SJS in HIV-positive individuals. Infectious causes like malaria were ruled out with negative testing.\\nVitals: Temperature is 37.7°C (99.9°F), blood pressure is 120/68 mmHg, pulse is 90 bpm, and respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute.\\nContent: The patient developed a productive cough with whitish sputum, followed one day later by a generalized skin rash that started on her trunk and spread to the extremities and mucosal membranes. Over the past two days, she also developed a sore throat and dysuria. The rash involves her lips, oral mucosa, conjunctivae, and genital mucosa, and has made talking and eating difficult and painful.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Infection usually results from exposure to respiratory secretions from cases or carriers, or exudates from cutaneous lesions. The incubation period is usually from 1-5 days, but occasionally can be longer. The frequency and severity of clinical symptoms and signs depend on the site  of  infection,  size  of  the  pseudomembrane  and  the  patient's immunization history.  However,  regardless  of  the  site  of  infection, systemic manifestations are similar and consequent to absorption of diphtheria toxin from these sites. The disease is usually localized to mucous membrane in the upper respiratory tract, the skin, or both. Symptoms and signs can develop at multiple sites in the upper respiratory tract, including the nose, pharynx, tonsils and larynx [5]. The characteristic feature of diphtheria is the formation of a tough, dirtygray, leather-like pseudomembrane at the site of infection.\\nThe most common site for respiratory diphtheria is the faucial area including  the  posterior  pharynx,  soft  palate,  periglottal  area,  uvula and tonsillar mucosa (Fig. 37.2). The onset is usually insidious and patients usually present with a low-grade fever ( < 103°F), sore throat, pain on swallowing, hoarseness of voice, pharyngeal injection, nasal discharge, cough, malaise and prostration [5, 6]. The pulse is usually more rapid than the fever would justify. On initial examination, the pharynx is injected, but patches of exudates may appear a day after illness onset. These patches may expand and coalesce to form a whiteto-dirty-gray,  tenacious  membrane  over  one  or  both  tonsils,  the nasopharynx, uvula and soft palate, and can extend downward into the larynx and trachea. The edge of the membrane is surrounded by a narrow zone of erythema and a broader zone of mucosal edema. Cervical lymph nodes are usually tender and enlarged and, along with cervical soft tissue edema, gives rise to the so-called bull-neck appearance and may cause respiratory stridor. Extension of the pseudomembrane from the pharynx to the larynx can result in life-threatening airway obstruction.\\n---\\n[CHIEF COMPLAINT]\\nDisease: Human Monkeypox\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was human monkeypox. This was a clinical diagnosis based on the patient's acute febrile illness, accompanied by a disseminated, uniform vesiculopustular skin rash involving the face, palms, soles, and oral mucosa, along with prominent generalized and cervical lymphadenopathy. This presentation is highly characteristic of monkeypox and distinguishes it from alternative diagnoses such as varicella, which typically presents with a heterogeneous rash and less prominent lymphadenopathy.\\nVitals: Temperature 38 °C (100.4 °F), pulse 110 beats per minute, blood pressure 105/82 mmHg.\\nContent: Acute febrile illness accompanied by malaise, headache, dry cough, neck swelling, and a disseminated skin rash, which appeared 2 days after initial symptoms.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Group A Streptococcus pharyngitis may be mild or associated with high fever,  tender  anterior  cervical  lymphadenopathy,  tonsillar  exudates and raised peripheral white cell count. Symptoms usually resolve after 3-5  days,  although  suppurative  complications  (which  are  now uncommon in industrialized settings) include peritonsillar and retropharyngeal  abscess,  suppurative  lymphadenitis,  otitis  media,  mastoiditis and  meningitis. Non-suppurative  complications  include scarlet fever, acute rheumatic fever or acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Scarlet fever is characterized by a diffuse blanching rash that spreads from the chest to the abdomen and extremities leaving a  sandpaper-like  texture  to  the  skin.  Desquamation  of  the  fingers, toes, groin and axilla occurs one or more weeks later. The tongue is frequently coated in a white film (white strawberry tongue) that eventually gives way to a beefy red appearance (red strawberry tongue). While most cases are benign, scarlet fever was often lethal in the preantibiotic era. Many cases likely represented what would be regarded today as streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS).\\nIn simple impetigo, infection is confined to the epidermis with the formation of superficial crusted lesions on the face or other exposed body  parts.  In  tropical  and  impoverished  settings  'pyodermatous' lesions may be pustular and ulcerative. Children are usually afebrile and otherwise well, although resolution of pyoderma may take many days and result in scarring. Erysipelas, which typically affects the face or  an  extremity,  is  a  painful  infection  of  the  dermis  resulting  in  a clearly  demarcated  red  and  raised  area  of  inflammation  and  often formation of superficial bullae. Cellulitis involves the deeper subcutaneous tissues  causing  a  more  diffuse  and  less  clearly  demarcated area of inflammation. Infection of the draining lymphatic tracts (lymphangitis) results in tender linear streaks extending from the site of infection. Unlike impetigo, cellulitis and erysipelas are usually associated with fever and systemic toxicity.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

This diagnosis is supported by the patient's presentation with chronic undulating fever, severe malnutrition, splenomegaly, generalized lymphadenopathy, and pancytopenia. Epidemiological risk was high, as she was from a known endemic area with a family history of the disease.

Initially, she was well between febrile episodes and played normally. However, over time she has developed progressive anorexia, a dry cough, chest pain, and joint and back pain.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Tuberculous Lymphadenitis with Paradoxical IRIS\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was tuberculous lymphadenitis with superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis, complicated by paradoxical immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).

During this period, he also developed a painful swelling in his neck. He has no other reported symptoms.\\n---\\n[MILD ILLNESS]\\nContent: Enteric fever is usually insidious. Fever may gradually increase over the first week of illness. Headache, anorexia, malaise, and other nonspecific,  flu-like  symptoms  are  common  and  may  precede  fever. Abdominal complaints  including  diarrhea,  constipation,  and  nonlocalizing abdominal pain each occur in less than a third of cases, but may raise clinical suspicion [16].\\nPhysical findings are also nonspecific. Relative bradycardia, or pulsetemperature dissociation, is considered a classic sign of enteric fever, but there is no widely accepted definition of relative bradycardia and little evidence that it is a useful predictor [17]. Rose spots are small, blanching pink macular lesions, typically 2-4 mm, that usually occur on the chest, abdomen and/or back during the second week of illness, but are infrequently observed. A white, yellow or brown coating of the tongue that spares the tongue's edges is common. Mild abdominal tenderness may be present. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, if present, are usually modest.\\n---\\n[SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS]\\nContent: Typically, the disease begins with the abrupt onset of intense headache, fever, chills, and myalgia. Fever often exceeds 40°C (103°F) and is preceded by rigors. Muscle pain can be excruciating and occurs most commonly in the thighs, calves, lumbosacral region, and abdomen. Abdominal  wall  pain  accompanied  by  palpation  tenderness  can mimic an acute surgical abdomen. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and sore throat are other frequent symptoms. Cough and chest pain figure prominently in reports of patients from Korea and China.\\nConjunctival suffusion is a helpful diagnostic clue that usually appears two  or  three  days  after  the  onset  of  fever  and  involves  the  bulbar conjunctiva.  Pus  and  serous  secretions  are  absent  and  there  is  no matting  of  the  eyelashes  and  eyelids.  Mild  suffusion  can  easily  be overlooked. Less common and less distinctive signs include pharyngeal injection, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and skin  lesions.  Within  a  week,  most  patients  become  asymptomatic. After several days of apparent recovery, the illness resumes in some individuals. Manifestations of the second stage are more variable and mild than those of the initial illness and usually last 2-4 days. Leptospires  disappear  from  the  blood,  cerebrospinal  fluid  (CSF),  and tissues, but appear in the urine. Serum antibody titers rise - hence the term  'immune'  phase.  Meningitis  is  the  hallmark  of  this  stage  of leptospirosis. Pleocytosis of the CSF can be demonstrated in 80-90% of all patients during the second week of illness, although only about 50% will have clinical signs and symptoms of meningitis. Meningeal signs can last several weeks, but usually resolve within a day or two. Uveitis  is  a  late  manifestation  of  leptospirosis,  generally  seen  4-8 months after the illness has begun. The anterior uveal tract is most frequently affected and pain, photophobia, and blurring of vision are the usual symptoms.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

Involvement and abscess formation and edema can result in obstruction  (swallowing  and  breathing),  pain,  tenderness,  trismus and neck stiffness. Visible soft tissue swelling can result from infections  of  the  peritonsillar,  parapharyngeal,  parotid,  submandibular, suprahyoid, periauricular and masseteric spaces. Peritonsillar abscess formation, also known as Quinsy, presents with unilateral swelling of  the  soft  palate  above  the  tonsil.  Abscess  formation  beneath  the floor of the mouth, called Ludwig's angina, produces tense and tender swelling behind the chin and between the angles of the jaw. Vincent's angina, or trench mouth, presents with localized or multiple necrotic mucosal  ulcerations  and  foul  breath.  Retropharyngeal  and  retroesophageal abscesses produce dysphagia and neck rigidity. Mediastinal spread is a potential complication that can lead to sepsis; rupture may lead to respiratory obstruction.  Erosion of the  great vessels of the neck can lead to catastrophic hemorrhage. Soft tissue lateral views of  the  head  and  neck  may  aid  in  diagnosing  retropharyngeal  and retroesophageal abscesses. Purulent material that is drained or aspirated from deep neck abscesses should be submitted for culture and sensitivity studies and the results used to adjust the selection of antibiotics. Treatment  should include aggressive antibiotic therapy against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms (including anaerobes), prompt incision and drainage of abscesses, and adequate nutrition and fluid therapy. Respiratory obstruction should be proactively addressed with consideration of artificial airways.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Tetanus\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is tetanus.

The clinical course, with worsening spasms despite initial treatment, is characteristic of the disease as the toxin continues to affect the nervous system.\\nVitals: On initial presentation, her pulse, blood pressure, and respiratory rate were all within normal limits. No fever was reported.\\nContent: The patient developed difficulty chewing and stiffness of the mouth three days after arriving in Europe from her home in rural Ethiopia. She reported that this symptom had never occurred before. The initial symptom was trismus, which is a common early presentation for tetanus as the muscles of mastication have the shortest motor neurons.\\n---\\n[WOUND BOTULISM]\\nContent: Wound botulism follows the absorption of toxin produced by organisms contaminating a wound site, so clinical incubation periods are longer than for botulism caused by food which contains preformed toxin.  Cases  have  increased  in  developed  countries  in  recent  years, driven by an epidemic among injecting drug-users and strongly associated with the practice of injecting into the subcutaneous tissues or muscle, known as 'skin-' or 'muscle-popping' . The majority of cases occur  in  the  USA  [7].  Sporadic  cases  of  botulism  associated  with contaminated compound fractures are occasionally reported.\\n---\\n[FINAL DIAGNOSIS]\\nDisease: Tetanus\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is tetanus.

Slowly progressive, debilitating polyarthralgias affecting peripheral joints, with transient joint swelling, also developed. Painful cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy lasted for about 1 week. Fever and other acute symptoms subsided within 1 week, but polyarthralgias persisted, showing a symmetrical pattern mainly affecting the small joints of the hands and feet, wrists, ankles, and knees. Upon return to Switzerland a few weeks later, the patient reported stiffness of the affected joints, mainly in the morning and after immobility, and the joint pains did not improve for two more months.\\n---\\n[TRENCH FEVER]\\nContent: Trench  fever  is  an  acute  disease  characterized  by  sudden  onset  of high-grade fever, headaches, dizziness, and a characteristic pain in the shins.

During the next few days,  these  symptoms continue and may be  accompanied  by anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, photophobia and cough. The fever is typically high (39-41°C) and associated with a severe  frontal  headache.  Rash,  considered  the  hallmark  feature  of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, appears on day three of fever as small, pink,  blanching  macules  (typically  on  the  wrists,  ankles  and  forearms) that evolve maculopapules. Within 24 hours, it spreads centrally to involve the legs, buttocks, arms, axillae, trunk, neck and face. The entire body may be involved, including the mucous membranes of the palate and pharynx [1 1]. Characteristic of the rash are petechial lesions,  in  a  distribution  that  includes  the  palms  and  soles,  which occur in 36% to 82% of patients. In some severe cases, petechiae may coalesce to form large ecchymoses. No eschar at the inoculation site is visible. Severe manifestations may include pulmonary edema and hemorrhage, cerebral edema, myocarditis, renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and gangrene. Three factors are independent predictors of failure by the physician to initiate therapy the first time a patient is seen: absence of a rash, presentation between August 1 and April 30, and presentation within the first three days of illness. In untreated patients who survive their illness, the natural course of fever terminates after two to three weeks.\\n---\\n[CHIEF COMPLAINT]\\nDisease: Human Monkeypox\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was human monkeypox. This was a clinical diagnosis based on the patient's acute febrile illness, accompanied by a disseminated, uniform vesiculopustular skin rash involving the face, palms, soles, and oral mucosa, along with prominent generalized and cervical lymphadenopathy. This presentation is highly characteristic of monkeypox and distinguishes it from alternative diagnoses such as varicella, which typically presents with a heterogeneous rash and less prominent lymphadenopathy.\\nVitals: Temperature 38 °C (100.4 °F), pulse 110 beats per minute, blood pressure 105/82 mmHg.\\nContent: Acute febrile illness accompanied by malaise, headache, dry cough, neck swelling, and a disseminated skin rash, which appeared 2 days after initial symptoms.\\n---\\n[CHIEF COMPLAINT]\\nDisease: Severe Fever With Thrombocytopenia Syndrome\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (SFTS), caused by the SFTS virus.

Some people also experience confusion, changes in mental state, or a rash (though this is more common in children) as the illness progresses. Ehrlichiosis is caused by various species of Ehrlichia bacteria, which spread primarily through the bite of an infected Lone Star tick, commonly found in south-central, southeastern, and eastern coastal states. These symptoms can mimic the flu or other tick-borne diseases like anaplasmosis, so a medical evaluation is needed to confirm the diagnosis.

In untreated patients who survive their illness, the natural course of fever terminates after two to three weeks.\\n---\\n[NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, PATHOLOGY, AND CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Pain and other symptoms may lessen with the rupture of the blister, but, at this time, pyogenic organisms invariably invade the superficial lesion and worm tract and aggravate the condition (Fig. 1 14.4). If the worm breaks during extraction and the remaining part retracts into the tissue, an intense inflammatory reaction occurs, with pain, swelling, and cellulitis along the worm tract, and usually the formation of an abscess. The reported period of incapacitation ranges from 2 to 16 weeks (average 8.5 weeks) [7-14] and more than half of a village's population may be affected at the same time. In addition to the blisters and skin lesions, the secondary bacterial infections usually exacerbate local inflammation and often lead to sepsis, abscesses, septic arthritis, contracture of muscles near joints, or even tetanus [15].\\nChronic manifestations are due to inflammation of the joints, with signs  and  symptoms  of  arthritis,  synovitis  [16],  and  muscle  and tendon contractures with resultant ankylosis of the limb [17]. Migration of the worms to the retroperitoneum and from the retroperitoneum  to  the  subcutaneous  tissue  in  the  leg  sometimes  results  in aberrant  (ectopic)  locations  such  as  the  pancreas,  lung,  periorbital tissues, testis, pericardium [18], and the spinal cord, producing compression [19] as well as focal abscess formation.\\n---\\n[VESICLES/BULLAE]\\nContent: Vesicles and  bullae  are fluid-filled  lesions. Herpetic involvement of the skin classically includes a vesicular phase, and is among the most common dermatoses encountered by the clinician. Herpetic vesicles lay on an erythematous base, and the lesions ulcerate and eventually heal  with  crusting.  Traditionally,  herpetic  ulcers  show  a  scalloped border with serosanguineous drainage, pain at the site, and, occasionally, ipsilateral lymphadenopathy. Chronic disease may lead to scarring. The patient experiences early dysesthesias at the site of a future eruption in recurrent disease. Most importantly, the diagnosis should be  suspected  in  those  with  chronic  ulcers,  particularly  if  they  are immunosuppressed.  Though  HSV-1  is  more  common  in  orofacial disease and HSV-2 in genital lesions, both strains can be seen in either location. Often a fixed location in the body is noted; however, primary disease can affect any area of the body.\\nZoster  infection  is  caused  by  reactivation  of  varicella  (chickenpox) virus  that  has  laid  dormant  in  basal  root  ganglia.  Zoster  usually presents with crop-like vesicles  along a dermatome. Zoster can disseminate, especially in immunocompromised patients. Greater than 20 lesions outside a dermatome should raise suspicion for dissemination. Ulcerations may be chronic, especially in immunocompromised patients. It is important to remember this diagnosis, particularly when steroid-responsive  diagnoses  such  as  pseudo-vesicular  Sweet's  syndrome (or idiopathic neutrophilic dermatosis) are considered, as oral steroid  use  in  patients  with  disseminated  zoster can be  lethal.  The occasionally  necrotic  center  of  evolving  lesions  may  easily  be  confused for a primary vasculitis. It is important to note, however, that vasculitis  seen in  the  setting  of  zoster  is  usually  reactive  and  not  a primary disease requiring steroids or cytotoxic medication, even when it is clearly present on skin biopsy.\\n---\\n[TRENCH FEVER]\\nContent: Trench  fever  is  an  acute  disease  characterized  by  sudden  onset  of high-grade fever, headaches, dizziness, and a characteristic pain in the shins.

       "    'content': \"PATIENT QUESTION:\\nI went hiking in a wooded area about three weeks ago and pulled a tiny tick off my leg afterwards. I didn't think much of it, but now I have a red rash on that spot that is clearing up in the middle, looking almost like a target or a bull's-eye. I also feel awful—I have a fever, chills, a stiff neck, and my whole body aches like I have the flu. Is this just a reaction to the bite or an infection?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[ROCKY MOUNTAIN SPOTTED FEVER]\\nContent: Around one week after being bitten by an infected tick, the disease begins with fever, chills, myalgia and headache. During the next few days,  these  symptoms continue and may be  accompanied  by anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, photophobia and cough. The fever is typically high (39-41°C) and associated with a severe  frontal  headache.  Rash,  considered  the  hallmark  feature  of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, appears on day three of fever as small, pink,  blanching  macules  (typically  on  the  wrists,  ankles  and  forearms) that evolve maculopapules. Within 24 hours, it spreads centrally to involve the legs, buttocks, arms, axillae, trunk, neck and face. The entire body may be involved, including the mucous membranes of the palate and pharynx [1 1]. Characteristic of the rash are petechial lesions,  in  a  distribution  that  includes  the  palms  and  soles,  which occur in 36% to 82% of patients. In some severe cases, petechiae may coalesce to form large ecchymoses. No eschar at the inoculation site is visible. Severe manifestations may include pulmonary edema and hemorrhage, cerebral edema, myocarditis, renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and gangrene. Three factors are independent predictors of failure by the physician to initiate therapy the first time a patient is seen: absence of a rash, presentation between August 1 and April 30, and presentation within the first three days of illness. In untreated patients who survive their illness, the natural course of fever terminates after two to three weeks.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Human African Trypanosomiasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is first-stage East African Trypanosomiasis caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. This was definitively confirmed by the microscopic demonstration of 5 to 10 trypanosomes per high power field on a thick blood film. The diagnosis is supported by the epidemiological link to a national game park in Malawi with tsetse fly exposure, and the clinical signs of fever, rash, and a trypanosomal chancre. The normal CSF confirmed the disease was in the first stage, without neurological involvement.\\nVitals: On presentation, his vital signs were: temperature 38 °C, pulse rate 130 bpm, and systolic blood pressure 60 mmHg. He later developed a sustained fever of 38 to 39 °C during his hospital stay.\\nContent: Two days prior to admission, the patient sustained a possible tick bite on his ankle while walking in the countryside. Twenty-four hours later, he developed a painless, indurated lesion on his left ankle, accompanied by fever and arthralgia. A blood film for malaria was negative, and he was treated with paracetamol. On the day of admission, his condition worsened with the development of a widespread itchy rash, followed by progressive difficulty breathing and faintness, consistent with anaphylactic shock.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Bites,  for  example  by  the  large  aggressive  flies  variously  known  as horse flies, gadflies or cleggs (Tabanidae), may be immediately painful and traumatic but the commonest problem is delayed local swelling and itching from exposure to insects' salivary allergens incurred by previous bites. A small, intensely itchy, reddish lump with a central (hemorrhagic)  punctum  develops  immediately  or  after  a  delay  of 24-48 hours. A papule, urticarial weal, blister or bulla may develop (e.g.  after  'Blandford  fly' Simulium posticatum bites  in  Oxfordshire, UK), or bites may provoke a more generalized erythema multiforme or,  especially  in  children,  papular  urticaria,  and  sometimes  even systemic  anaphylaxis  may  be  provoked.  Triatomine  bug  bites  are usually multiple - often near the eye or angle of the mouth. They are painful, swollen, ooze blood and may be surrounded by black staining from the bug's feces (see Chapter 98, 'Chagas' Disease'). Scratching may lead to secondary infection, an inflamed, painful pustule or carbuncle, or a demarcated, hot, bright red, raised area of erysipelas or cellulitis. Causative bacteria include Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes . The risk of secondary infection seems to be higher under humid tropical conditions. It may be difficult to distinguish between  envenoming  or  allergy,  resulting  in  early  symptoms  after minutes or a few hours, and infection, resulting in late symptoms after many hours or even days.\\nFIGURE 136.2.1 Bug bite, São Paulo, Brazil (© David A. Warrell).\\n---\\n[SYMPTOMS OF ENVENOMING [6-9]]\\nContent: Envenoming by H. suspectum and H. horridum causes identical clinical syndromes. Pain may start immediately and is described as throbbing or burning. It may radiate up the bitten limb to the shoulder, chest and epigastrium, and is often excruciating in intensity, persisting for 24 hours or more. Swelling also develops rapidly, extending, in some cases, to involve the whole limb, but although it may be tense, compartment  syndrome  has  never  been  described.  The  bite  site  is  erythematous  or  cyanosed  with  traumatic  ecchymoses  and  persistent bleeding, but tissue necrosis does not develop. Red lymphangitic lines extend up the limb and regional lymph glands may become tender and enlarged. Local paresthesia, hyperesthesia and even paralysis have been  described.  The  earliest  systemic  symptoms  start  within  five minutes of the bite: dizziness, weakness, nausea, vomiting, profuse generalized sweating, breathlessness and weakness. Hypotension and tachycardia are commonly recorded. These symptoms may be transient or recurrent. Less commonly, there is angioedema (swelling of lips,  tongue,  throat  and  upper  airway)  [10],  increased  secretions, chills, fever and tinnitus.\\n---\\n[TRENCH FEVER]\\nContent: Trench  fever  is  an  acute  disease  characterized  by  sudden  onset  of high-grade fever, headaches, dizziness, and a characteristic pain in the shins. Dizziness and headaches are sometime so sudden that soldiers have been known to fall over in the trenches. Other symptoms include post-orbital  pain  (typically  exacerbated by movement), pain in  the lower limbs and back, constipation, a rash on the face, and a loss of appetite [12]. The first episode of fever may last 2-4 days and may be followed  by  relapses  every  4-6  days,  giving  rise  to  trench  fever's\\nFIGURE  67. 1 Body  louse,  a  vector  for B.  quintana ,  sucking  blood  on  a homeless patient.\\nFIGURE 67. 2 Pediculosis and super infection in a homeless man seeking care during a snapshot intervention in shelters.

I have constant diarrhea that is pale and smells terrible. I’ve also lost a lot of weight without trying, and I feel incredibly tired and weak all the time. My tongue also feels sore and burns. I thought it was just traveler’s diarrhea, but it's been weeks and isn't going away. What could be wrong?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[INTRODUCTION]\\nContent: Diarrheal disease is common among populations in tropical regions of the world and is a frequent illness in returned travelers. Acute and chronic  diarrhea  were  the  most  common  reasons  for  individuals seeking  post-travel  medical  care  in  the  GeoSentinel  surveillance network  of  17  tropical  and  travel  medicine  clinics  throughout  the world [1]. Presentation with acute diarrhea occurred at a rate of 222 visits  per  1000  travelers  seeking  medical  care,  and chronic  diarrhea occurred at a rate of 1 13 per 1000 visits, with the highest relative rates from  South  Asia  [1,  2].  At  the  Hospital  for  Tropical  Diseases  in London,  gastrointestinal  complaints  were  responsible  for  39%  of attendances at the walk-in clinic over the course of a year in which over 3000 patients used the service. Following an episode of diarrhea during travel, approximately 2% of individuals will go on to chronic illness [3].\\n---\\n[TRAVELER'S DIARRHEA]\\nContent: Campylobacter species  is  an  important  cause  of  traveler's  diarrhea. Most Campylobacter infections in travelers cause symptoms, although frank dysentery is rare. In a study of Spanish travelers with Campylobacter enteritis acquired in developing countries, only 4% had dysentery. Abdominal cramps were present in 83% of cases, fever in 46%, nausea and vomiting in 42%, and grossly bloody diarrhea in only 3% of cases [6, 7].\\n---\\n[EPIDEMIOLOGY]\\nContent: The  differential  diagnosis,  at  the  beginning  of  the  illness,  would include pathogenic enteric bacteria or viruses. However, as the illness progresses, the differential would include other intestinal protozoa, including Giardia lamblia .  A  rare  cause  of  illness  in  travelers, Cystoisospora  belli ,  can  produce  a  prolonged  diarrhea  after  travel,  and  is sensitive to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Fatigue and weight loss can be caused by Entamoeba histolytica , but anorexia is not as prominent. Dientamoeba fragilis can cause prolonged, low-grade intestinal symptoms, but without anorexia or weight loss. Fatigue and weight loss can be due to tropical sprue, which is a rare cause of prolonged diarrhea  in  travelers.  Celiac  sprue  occasionally  manifests  during foreign travel.\\n---\\n[ETIOLOGY]\\nContent: Etiologies of diarrhea in returned travelers can be divided into infectious, usually parasitic and  bacterial [4-6], post-infectious, for example lactose intolerance and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) [7], and non-infectious, such as inflammatory bowel disease (Table 1461). There is a wide range of microbial agents that cause diarrhea. Many episodes of  travelers' diarrhea  caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli will be self-limiting; however, invasive bacterial infections, such as Shigella spp., can produce more serious infections that will need antimicrobial  treatment.  For  diarrhea that lasts  more  than  14  days post-travel, protozoan parasites are more common: Giardia , the most\\n---\\n[DIARRHEA]\\nContent: Travelers' diarrhea has a reported incidence of at least 200 cases/1000 ill  returned travelers [3].  Fever is self-reported in one-third of these patients, making it an important underlying etiology in febrile travelers.  Specific  pathogens  vary  according  to  destination,  setting  and season; however, enteric bacteria including Escherichia coli , Campylobacter , Salmonella , and Shigella are the most common. In up to 50%, no  pathogen  is  identified.  The  combination  of  fever  and  bloody diarrhea is suggestive of bacterial or amebic dysentery, with the latter (uncommon in the returning traveler) often having a more indolent onset. In both cases, empiric  antibiotics should be considered (see below). It should be noted that any systemic febrile infection may have  diarrhea  at  presentation;  for  example,  severe  sepsis,  malaria, pneumococcal pneumonia.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

I thought it was just allergies or dry skin, but it's getting worse. What could this be?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Onchocerciasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is onchocerciasis (river blindness), caused by the filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus. The diagnosis was established based on the highly typical clinical triad of chronic pruritic dermatitis, subcutaneous nodules over bony prominences, and characteristic corneal opacities (sclerosing keratitis). This is strongly supported by the patient's lifelong residency in an endemic region of Togo near a fast-flowing river, the known breeding site for the Simulium blackfly vector.\\nContent: The patient has noticed changes in both eyes over the past 4 years, without current visual disturbances, but he is worried because adults in his village have gone blind after similar changes. For the past two decades, he has developed multiple painless bumps under his skin. He also suffers from intense itching of his skin that is severe enough to keep him awake at night.\\n---\\n[EDEMA]\\nContent: web spaces, genital involvement, and evidence of the causative mite on a mineral oil preparation can usually readily diagnose the latter condition. Of note, hyperpigmentation is not a distinguishing feature in differentiating among these diseases, as chronic infection in both may  lead to atopic dermatitis-like disease and patchy  hypo/ hyperpigmentation.  Plate-like  ichthyosis  over  leathery  skin  with hypo/hyperpigmentation,  commonly  referred  to  as  leopard  skin, would point to the diagnosis of chronic onchocerciasis. Loss of elasticity of skin can lead to 'hanging groin' .\\nTrichinosis can also be the cause of edema, though in this case, periorbital, nondependent edema is most commonly noted. Other dermatologic findings may include a hypersensitivity-like petechial rash, xerosis and subconjunctival hemorrhage.\\nAmerican trypanosomiasis can be difficult to diagnose acutely given its  nonspecific  systemic  and  dermatologic  manifestations.  Distinguishing features  of acute disease include the so-called 'chagoma', where the protozoal inoculum causes subcutaneous swelling, induration and erythema accompanied by local lymphadenopathy. When the eye is the portal of entry, Romañ a's sign may develop, comprised of  unilateral, painless, periorbital edema and conjunctival swelling. African trypanosomiasis also includes skin manifestations. A chancre can develop at the site of a bite from an infecting tsetse fly. The lesion can  rapidly  enlarge  and  ulcerate,  and  can  be  associated  with  local lymphadenopathy.  In  East  African  trypanosomiasis,  caused  by T. rhodesiense , high fever and toxemia are common, and patients often present  for  clinical  attention.  A  diffuse  macular  rash  may  also  be present.  In  West  African  trypanosomiasis,  caused  by T.  gambiense ,\\n---\\n[MEDICAL HISTORY AND EXAMINATION]\\nContent: Within  endemic  areas,  schistosomiasis  must  be  suspected  in  all patients presenting any symptom, however vague, that can be related to the infection. In travelers and migrants, a careful residence or travel history can help establish the diagnosis of schistosomiasis [31, 33]. In several sub-Saharan areas, both S. mansoni and S. haematobium, and even S. intercalatum, can be contracted. The patient who has lived in,\\n877\\nor  visited,  endemic  areas  must  be  asked  about  skin  contact  with freshwater of any kind, even if considered locally as safe or snail-free. Contacts of any type or duration can lead to infection. The patient may, or may not, report itching or rash shortly after the water contact. Visual  inspection  may help  diagnose  'swimmers'  itch'  after  recent exposure.\\nA medical history may reveal intermittent symptoms since the potential exposure, including flu-like syndromes in the weeks or months thereafter. Malaise, fatigue,  muscle pains, appetite loss, intermittent diarrhea, vague abdominal pain and red or dark urine are potential warning signs - partly depending on the suspected species. A neurologic history and examination is performed to exclude early cerebrospinal involvement. Abdominal palpation may reveal hepatomegaly or  splenomegaly  of  varying  degrees  and  abdominal  tenderness  or distention, but also may be entirely negative.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Bites,  for  example  by  the  large  aggressive  flies  variously  known  as horse flies, gadflies or cleggs (Tabanidae), may be immediately painful and traumatic but the commonest problem is delayed local swelling and itching from exposure to insects' salivary allergens incurred by previous bites. A small, intensely itchy, reddish lump with a central (hemorrhagic)  punctum  develops  immediately  or  after  a  delay  of 24-48 hours. A papule, urticarial weal, blister or bulla may develop (e.g.  after  'Blandford  fly' Simulium posticatum bites  in  Oxfordshire, UK), or bites may provoke a more generalized erythema multiforme or,  especially  in  children,  papular  urticaria,  and  sometimes  even systemic  anaphylaxis  may  be  provoked.

The rash began on the forearms about 1 week after fever onset, spread to the trunk, neck, and face, and faded after 3 days. Slowly progressive, debilitating polyarthralgias affecting peripheral joints, with transient joint swelling, also developed. Painful cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy lasted for about 1 week. Fever and other acute symptoms subsided within 1 week, but polyarthralgias persisted, showing a symmetrical pattern mainly affecting the small joints of the hands and feet, wrists, ankles, and knees.

Some deep infections, such as hand flexor tendon\\nFIGURE 13.2 Osteomyelitis pathway.\\nsheaths, require early surgical debridement, or significant functional impairment can result.\\nOther soft tissue infections that can be seen in tropical environments are:  atypical  bacteria  (tularemia,  brucellosis),  fungi  (aspergillosis, cryptococcosis), and parasites (echinococosis, trichinosis).\\nTropical  pyomyositis  was  first  described  in  Uganda  in  1968  and presents with single to multiple suppurative lesions within skeletal muscle. It is more common in HIV-positive patients. Large muscles of the lower extremities and pelvic girdle are common sites of infection. Studies suggest up to 50% of patients report a previous injury. Examination usually reveals fever, diffuse fusiform swelling, and significant tenderness on palpation or passive stretching of the involved muscle, but usually no palpable fluid collection or fluctuation. The abscess is subfascial, within the muscle tissue itself, and poorly contained. S. aureus accounts for near 90% of cases. Multiple attempts at aspiration  with  a  large-bore  needle  are  often  necessary  to  retrieve purulent material,  and  should  be done  when  the  diagnosis  is  suspected. Orthopedic management is incision and drainage of abscesses or debridement of necrotic tissue if involvement is extensive. Antibiotics are necessary.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Cutaneous larva migrans\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is cutaneous larva migrans (CLM), caused by the accidental infestation of human skin by larvae of dog and cat hookworms.

The rash began on the forearms about 1 week after fever onset, spread to the trunk, neck, and face, and faded after 3 days. Slowly progressive, debilitating polyarthralgias affecting peripheral joints, with transient joint swelling, also developed. Painful cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy lasted for about 1 week. Fever and other acute symptoms subsided within 1 week, but polyarthralgias persisted, showing a symmetrical pattern mainly affecting the small joints of the hands and feet, wrists, ankles, and knees.

This was confirmed by direct microscopic identification of Giardia trophozoites and cysts in stool samples. The clinical presentation of greasy, foul-smelling stools, bloating, and evidence of carbohydrate malabsorption (positive reducing substances in stool) is classic for this infection.\\nVitals: The patient has no fever; no other vital signs are reported.\\nContent: For the past two weeks, the patient has experienced four to five episodes of loose stools per day, accompanied by weight loss, anorexia, malaise, flatulence, and abdominal cramping during defecation. For the last three days, he has noted bloating and distension after consuming milk products. While he has mild nausea, he reports no fever. His stools were initially watery, but after a 5-day course of ciprofloxacin from a local pharmacy (which ended two days ago), they are now three to four per day and described as mushy, greasy, and foul-smelling.\\n---\\n[ABDOMINAL DISTENSION]\\nContent: Abdominal distension may be due to gas, either within or outside the  bowel  lumen.  Extraluminal  gas  is  seen  in  bowel  perforation, which is a surgical emergency. Gaseous distension of the bowel may be due to mechanical obstruction or motility disorder. Bloating is a common symptom in lactose malabsorption, which is commonplace among Africans and Asians after childhood, and in irritable bowel syndrome.\\n---\\n[SMALL BOWEL]\\nContent: A  wide  variety  of  disease  processes  give  rise  to  similar  histologic abnormalities in the mucosa of the small intestine, resulting in predictable  clinical  manifestations.  The  first  event  is  infiltration  of lymphocytes into the epithelium, resulting in an intraepithelial lymphocytosis. Next, there is increased crypt cell proliferation, resulting in  crypt  hyperplasia.  Then,  loss  of  villous  cells  leads  to  increasing degrees of villous atrophy, eventually leading to a flat mucosa. As a consequence of  mucosal malabsorption, patients present with diarrhea,  steatorrhea  and  weight  loss.  Laboratory  studies  may  be helpful in defining the extent of the malabsorption syndrome. Anemia may result from deficiencies of iron, folate and/or vitamin B12 - the latter implying that the mucosal damage extends to involve the terminal ileum. Prolongation of the prothrombin time may be due to a deficiency of vitamin K (one of the fat-soluble vitamins, along with A, D and E), which occurs in fat malabsorption. Hypophosphatemia, hypocalcemia  and  an  elevated  alkaline  phosphatase  are  seen  in vitamin D deficiency, which may cause osteomalacia or osteoporosis. Conditions that cause these histologic abnormalities and present with these  clinical  and  laboratory  features  include  parasitic  infections, celiac disease, tropical sprue, bacterial overgrowth and Crohn's disease (Box 3.4). Similar clinical manifestations may be seen in other disorders with specific pathologic findings, such as intestinal lymphoma and amyloidosis. The general principles of treating disorders of the small intestinal mucosa include treating the underlying disease and correcting any nutrient deficiencies that may be present. In addition, a lactose-free, low-fat diet may be beneficial.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Spinal cord schistosomiasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The patient was diagnosed with spinal cord schistosomiasis complicating an infection with Schistosoma haematobium. The diagnosis was established based on the clinical presentation of a conus syndrome, a clear exposure history of swimming in Lake Malawi, the prior identification of S. haematobium eggs in his urine, significant peripheral eosinophilia, and characteristic MRI findings of a lesion in the conus medullaris and bladder wall thickening. His complete recovery following treatment with praziquantel and corticosteroids further supports the diagnosis.\\nVitals: He has normal vital signs; specific values were not reported.\\nContent: For three weeks, the patient experienced progressive difficulty urinating, requiring increasing abdominal pressure and only being able to pass small amounts at a time, associated with lower abdominal discomfort, abnormal sensations in the groins and genitals, and some erectile dysfunction. He also reports that walking did not feel normal, though he could not specify the abnormality. He denies weakness, dysaesthesia, or loss of sensation in his legs, and has no backache. Over the past two months, he had an unintentional weight loss of 8kg and fatigue without fever or night sweats. One week prior to presentation, he noticed a single episode of reddish urine discoloration without painful micturition or fever, for which he was treated at a local clinic. There is no history of trauma.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Intestinal capillariasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is intestinal capillariasis caused by the nematode Capillaria philippinensis. The diagnosis was established based on the patient's clinical presentation of severe chronic diarrhoea, profound malabsorption with weight loss and oedema, and electrolyte abnormalities. Definitive confirmation was made by the identification of characteristic peanut-shaped ova on stool microscopy. The patient's residence in an endemic region and her positive clinical response to albendazole therapy further substantiated the diagnosis.\\nVitals: On presentation, the patient was afebrile, with a heart rate of 100 bpm and blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg.\\nContent: Symptoms began two months prior with stomach rumbles and colicky abdominal pain, which later progressed to anorexia and vomiting.

Some people also experience unintentional weight loss, muscle wasting, or signs of vitamin deficiencies such as anemia, dry skin, or bruising easily as the condition progresses. Malabsorption is caused by damage to the small intestine lining (from conditions like Celiac or Crohn's disease), enzyme deficiencies (like lactose intolerance), or issues with the pancreas, liver, or gallbladder that prevent the proper breakdown of food. These symptoms can arise from various underlying digestive disorders, so medical tests like stool analysis or hydrogen breath tests are needed to identify the specific cause.

A small, intensely itchy, reddish lump with a central (hemorrhagic)  punctum  develops  immediately  or  after  a  delay  of 24-48 hours. A papule, urticarial weal, blister or bulla may develop (e.g.  after  'Blandford  fly' Simulium posticatum bites  in  Oxfordshire, UK), or bites may provoke a more generalized erythema multiforme or,  especially  in  children,  papular  urticaria,  and  sometimes  even systemic  anaphylaxis  may  be  provoked.  Triatomine  bug  bites  are usually multiple - often near the eye or angle of the mouth. They are painful, swollen, ooze blood and may be surrounded by black staining from the bug's feces (see Chapter 98, 'Chagas' Disease'). Scratching may lead to secondary infection, an inflamed, painful pustule or carbuncle, or a demarcated, hot, bright red, raised area of erysipelas or cellulitis. Causative bacteria include Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes . The risk of secondary infection seems to be higher under humid tropical conditions. It may be difficult to distinguish between  envenoming  or  allergy,  resulting  in  early  symptoms  after minutes or a few hours, and infection, resulting in late symptoms after many hours or even days.\\nFIGURE 136.2.1 Bug bite, São Paulo, Brazil (© David A.

The envenomation was most likely caused by an African puff-adder (*Bitis arietans*), based on the snake's distinct physical description, its behavior, the geographic location in Malawi, and the clinical presentation of severe local cytotoxic effects (haemorrhagic bullae, massive swelling, extensive necrosis) and initial systemic haematotoxicity (bleeding gums). The patient's septic shock on arrival was a late complication of the untreated necrotic wound.\\nVitals: On admission, the patient appeared weak and was in respiratory distress. His temperature was 39.4 °C, pulse 126 bpm, blood pressure 85/60 mmHg, and respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute.\\nContent: Three weeks prior to presentation, the patient was bitten by a snake while playing in rocky grassland. The snake was described as brown with V-shaped black bands and approximately one metre long. Shortly after the bite, he developed haemorrhagic bullae on his right leg, bleeding gums, and extensive vomiting.

However, he subsequently developed intense pain and swelling at the bite site, which progressed to the current necrotic wound.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Snakebite envenomation\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is a severe cytotoxic and haemotoxic snakebite envenomation, complicated by secondary bacterial infection and sepsis. The causative agent was identified as most probably the African puff-adder (Bitis arietans), based on the snake's description, the endemic location, and the clinical manifestations of massive local tissue necrosis and initial systemic haemorrhage. The diagnosis was supported by laboratory findings of leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia, and the patient's septic clinical state upon late presentation.\\nVitals: The patient appears weak and is in respiratory distress.

In the case of an infection, a local reaction called trypanosomal chancre (Fig. 97.4) can develop at the site where the fly has injected parasites with its saliva. A small raised papule develops after about 5 days. It increases rapidly in size, surrounded by an intense erythematous tissue reaction with local edema and regional lymphadenopathy. Although some chancres have a very angry appearance, they are usually not very painful unless they become ulcerated and superinfected. They heal without treatment after several weeks,  leaving  a  permanent,  hyperpigmented  spot.  Trypanosomal chancres occur in more than half the cases of T. b. rhodesiense . In T. b. gambiense ,  they are much less common and often go undetected in endemic  populations.  Inexperienced  clinicians  might  misdiagnose chancres  as  cutaneous  manifestations  of  bacterial  diseases,  such  as superinfected insect bites, eschar or cutaneous anthrax.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

Her parents reported that when they tried to squeeze the lesion, they observed white oval granules emerging from the nodule.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Burrows most commonly occur in the interdigital clefts between the fingers  and  on  the  wrists,  but  may  be  widespread  (Fig.  136.4.1). Tracks  are  serpiginous,  extending  for  a  few  millimeters  up  to  one centimeter,  creating  linear  papulovescular  lesions  with  excoriation, secondary  infection,  eczematization,  lichenification  and  erythematous papules. Lesions are intensely itchy, especially at night and after a  hot  bath  or  shower, provoking scratching -  excoriation that promotes secondary infection. In about 7% of cases, very itchy reddish brown  nodules  occur  on  the  genitalia,  groin,  buttocks  and  axillae (nodular scabies). In infants, vesicular, pustular and nodular lesions are found on the axillae, head, face, diaper region, palms and soles. An exuberantly crusting form, Norwegian scabies, occurs in patients immunosuppressed by HIV, human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-1 or by drugs employed in organ transplantation, and in people with trisomy-21. Demarcated, hyperkeratotic, scaly plaques involve, in particular,  the  extremities,  scalp,  face,  neck  and  buttocks.  The  scales contain thousands of mites and the load per patient may exceed 1 million mites. This type of scabies is very infectious and a single case can give rise to nosocomial outbreaks.\\n---\\n[FOOT INFECTIONS]\\nContent: Athlete's  foot or  tinea  pedis  is  a  term  used  to  describe  scaling  and maceration accompanied by itching between the toes, particularly the fourth  interdigital  space.  It  is  a  syndrome  that  may  be  caused  by Candida species, erythrasma or Gram-negative bacteria, as well as by dermatophytes. In dermatophyte infections, the area between the toes may be wet or dry and, in some infections, particularly those caused by Trichophyton interdigitale , vesicular. Involvement of the dorsum of the foot or the sole may occur. The commonest cause is T. rubrum .\\nSymptoms may be minimal. It is more common in people who wear shoes and socks and is therefore associated with urban areas in the tropics.\\nTinea pedis in tropical areas must be distinguished from eczema and, less commonly, plantar psoriasis [4]. The interplay between bacteria and fungi is poorly understood but, in the tropics, secondary Gramnegative bacterial infection on top of interdigital dermatophytosis can occur.\\n---\\n[ONYCHOMYCOSIS]\\nContent: Dermatophyte invasion of the nails is uncommon in the tropics. The nail  plate  is  invaded  from  the  distal  border  and  lateral  surfaces, usually from the underside. The affected nail becomes thickened and opaque  with  a  varying  degree  of  onycholysis.  Patients  often  have infection of other sites, such as the soles or toe webs. In addition to psoriasis, other fungal infections, for example candida or Scytalidium , must be differentiated from onychomycosis caused by dermatophytes [7].\\n---\\n[FINAL DIAGNOSIS]\\nDisease: Tungiasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is tungiasis, an infestation caused by the burrowing female sand flea, Tunga penetrans. The diagnosis was made clinically based on the pathognomonic appearance of a dark nodule on the toe with a central ulceration, the history of white oval granules (eggs) emerging with pressure, and strong epidemiological links, including living on a farm in an endemic region of Bolivia with a similarly affected family member.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

This morning, I woke up with a cluster of small, red, itchy bumps on my ankles and feet. They look a bit like mosquito bites but are much itchier. Is this something I need to worry about, or will it go away on its own?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Human African Trypanosomiasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is first-stage East African Trypanosomiasis caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. This was definitively confirmed by the microscopic demonstration of 5 to 10 trypanosomes per high power field on a thick blood film. The diagnosis is supported by the epidemiological link to a national game park in Malawi with tsetse fly exposure, and the clinical signs of fever, rash, and a trypanosomal chancre. The normal CSF confirmed the disease was in the first stage, without neurological involvement.\\nVitals: On presentation, his vital signs were: temperature 38 °C, pulse rate 130 bpm, and systolic blood pressure 60 mmHg. He later developed a sustained fever of 38 to 39 °C during his hospital stay.\\nContent: Two days prior to admission, the patient sustained a possible tick bite on his ankle while walking in the countryside. Twenty-four hours later, he developed a painless, indurated lesion on his left ankle, accompanied by fever and arthralgia. A blood film for malaria was negative, and he was treated with paracetamol. On the day of admission, his condition worsened with the development of a widespread itchy rash, followed by progressive difficulty breathing and faintness, consistent with anaphylactic shock.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Bites,  for  example  by  the  large  aggressive  flies  variously  known  as horse flies, gadflies or cleggs (Tabanidae), may be immediately painful and traumatic but the commonest problem is delayed local swelling and itching from exposure to insects' salivary allergens incurred by previous bites. A small, intensely itchy, reddish lump with a central (hemorrhagic)  punctum  develops  immediately  or  after  a  delay  of 24-48 hours. A papule, urticarial weal, blister or bulla may develop (e.g.  after  'Blandford  fly' Simulium posticatum bites  in  Oxfordshire, UK), or bites may provoke a more generalized erythema multiforme or,  especially  in  children,  papular  urticaria,  and  sometimes  even systemic  anaphylaxis  may  be  provoked.  Triatomine  bug  bites  are usually multiple - often near the eye or angle of the mouth. They are painful, swollen, ooze blood and may be surrounded by black staining from the bug's feces (see Chapter 98, 'Chagas' Disease'). Scratching may lead to secondary infection, an inflamed, painful pustule or carbuncle, or a demarcated, hot, bright red, raised area of erysipelas or cellulitis. Causative bacteria include Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes . The risk of secondary infection seems to be higher under humid tropical conditions. It may be difficult to distinguish between  envenoming  or  allergy,  resulting  in  early  symptoms  after minutes or a few hours, and infection, resulting in late symptoms after many hours or even days.\\nFIGURE 136.2.1 Bug bite, São Paulo, Brazil (© David A. Warrell).\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Cutaneous myiasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The diagnosis is cutaneous furuncular myiasis caused by the larva of the Tumbu fly, *Cordylobia anthropophaga*. This was confirmed by the characteristic clinical presentation of a slowly evolving, itchy boil in a traveler returning from Ghana, and the successful extraction of the maggot after occlusive therapy. The pulsating appearance of the larva's respiratory spiracles upon close inspection was a key diagnostic feature, effectively ruling out a bacterial abscess or other causes of eschar.\\nVitals: The patient was afebrile. No other vital signs were reported.\\nContent: The patient presented with a localized swelling on her left leg which had developed slowly over the preceding 3 weeks following a trip abroad. The lesion was described as itchy but not painful. There was no history of fever or other systemic symptoms, and the patient was otherwise feeling fine. She did not recall any specific arthropod bites.\\n---\\n[ACUTE SCHISTOSOMIASIS (KATAYAMA FEVER)]\\nContent: This should be considered in febrile travelers returning from Africa. Travelers give a history of freshwater exposure 4-6 (up to 9) weeks prior  to  symptom  onset.  Some  describe  a  self-resolving  itchy  rash immediately  following  exposure  (swimmer's  itch).  Symptoms  and signs include fever, lethargy, myalgia, arthralgia, cough, wheeze, headache,  urticarial  rash,  diarrhea  and  hepatosplenomegaly  [19].  The\\nFIGURE 143.4 Patient returned 1 month previously from a 2-week holiday in Thailand. Two days ago, he developed fever, headache and rash.

He describes developing 'sunstroke' on the last day of his holiday (sunburn,  headache,  feverish).  Symptoms  have  not  settled.  Diagnosis: dengue.\\neosinophil count is usually elevated at presentation of acute schistosomiasis and provides supportive evidence for the diagnosis, but it may only appear a few days after symptom onset. Acute symptoms are self-limiting in most cases.\\n---\\n[PREVENTION]\\nContent: Be  prepared  for  insect  bites,  not  only  in  tropical  rain  forests  and beaches, but also in the arctic and in cool mountainous terrain such as  the  Californian  Sierra  Nevada,  Italian  Dolomites  and  Scottish Highlands. The risk of getting bitten varies geographically, seasonally and diurnally. Seek specific advice.\\n- Sensible clothing should be as ample and protective as comfort (but not vanity) demands. Long sleeves and long trousers should be worn after dusk. Light colors are less attractive to mosquitoes than dark ones. Blue color attracts African tsetse flies (see Chapter 97, 'Sleeping Sickness'). Hats and face veils may be necessary to protect against mass attacks on face and scalp by swarms of Scottish midges (Culicoides), or tropical blackflies (Simulium). This protection is recommended in places where there is a high risk of acquiring muco-cutaneous leishmaniasis by bites of tiny sandflies (Phlebotomus,  Lutzomyia),  for  example  Manu  National  Park in Peru.\\n- Effective repellents include diethyl-toluamide (DEET) and p-methane-diol. These can be applied to exposed skin or impregnated into cotton clothing and socks, and ankle, wrist and head bands.\\n- Clothes can be impregnated with pyrethroid insecticides but this may impair waterproofing.\\n- Protect sleeping quarters. Night bites by mosquitoes that transmit malaria,  cone-nosed  (triatomine)  'kissing'  bugs  (Central  and South America) that transmit Chagas' disease, bed bugs, soft ticks that  transmit  tick-borne  encephalitis  and  tick-borne  relapsing fever, and even vampire bats that transmit rabies (see Chapters 34.1 and 134.6), can be prevented by sleeping under a a well tucked-in pyrethroid-impregnated  mosquito  net.  Mosquito  proofing  of sleeping quarters and insecticide spraying at dusk reduces the risk. Pyrethroid-releasing mosquito coils can be burned or, if there is electricity,  plug-in  insecticide  vaporizers  can be used. Fans  may deter mosquitoes from biting.\\nAlthough  not  related  to  insect  bites,  beware  of  Chagas'  disease acquired through drinking raw jungle fruit and sugar cane juices (e.g. in Brazil and Venezuela) contaminated with infected triatomine bugs (see 'American trypanosomiasis').\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

       "    'content': \"PATIENT QUESTION:\\nI recently came back from a backpacking trip in Southeast Asia where I did a lot of hiking in muddy areas during the rainy season. Since I got home, I've developed a fever, a bad cough with some chest pain, and a headache that won't go away. I also noticed a painful sore on my leg that looks like an abscess and isn't healing. I have diabetes, so I'm worried about infection. Could this be related to my trip?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[INTRODUCTION]\\nContent: Up to 70% of travelers to developing countries report health problems,  the  majority  of  which  are  self-limiting;  however  8-15%  of travelers are ill enough to seek medical attention while abroad or on return home, with fever as a common presenting complaint [1-4]. While  for  many  the  underlying  cause  is  a  self-limiting  globally endemic infection, such as gastroenteritis, physicians are increasingly encountering conditions not normally seen in the patient's country of origin. In some cases these are potentially life-threatening, such as malaria, and others have potential public health consequences, such as enteric fever.\\nTo evaluate returned travelers presenting with fever, an understanding of the geographic distribution of infections, risk factors for acquisition, incubation periods and clinical presentations is required. With this understanding, a risk assessment can be undertaken, initial investigations  instigated,  and,  when  appropriate,  presumptive  therapy started.\\n---\\n[PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS [5]]\\nContent: The evaluation of fever in returned travelers requires an understanding of the epidemiologic factors which influence exposure to specific pathogens. These factors are reflected in the travel history and include geographic  destinations  visited,  dates  of  particular  risk  exposures, time  of  onset  and  duration  of  symptoms.  The  first  two  determine which infections the traveler may have been exposed to and the last two  allow  for  an  estimation  of  the  incubation  period  (see  Tables 143.1 & 143.2).\\nAs can be seen from Figure 143.1, the travel history is vital for determining the likely diagnosis, as many infections can have similar clinical presentations. Certain symptoms and signs may give further clues; relevant examination findings include rash, eschar, hepatosplenomegaly and jaundice (see Tables 143-3, 143-4 & 143-5). Table 143-6 lists  the  differential  diagnosis  in  patients  with  chronic  fever  ( > 2 weeks), and is a reminder that noninfectious causes of fever are seen in this group.\\nTravelers presenting with undifferentiated fever should have a number of initial recommended investigations performed (see Table 143-7). Following this, specific investigations may be appropriate, depending on the differential diagnosis (see Table 143-8). Where tuberculosis is considered, it is essential that adequate samples of sputum or tissue for  mycobacteria  culture  are  obtained.  Tuberculin  skin  tests  and interferon-gamma release assays have a limited role in evaluation of patients with chronic fever.\\nRarely, fever in the returned traveler may be due to a viral hemorrhagic fever such as Lassa, Ebola, Marburg or Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever.  The  diagnosis  should  be  considered  in  travelers  who  have visited endemic regions within 21 days of symptom onset [29,30], in particular, travel to rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa (particularly West Africa); contact with suspected cases, healthcare facilities, rats or wild animals  raises  the  index  of  suspicion.  Symptoms  and  signs  vary according to pathogen, with bleeding in  advanced  cases.  Although rare, these infections can be severe and have implications for nosocomial transmission. Malaria must be excluded; however, PCR of blood may be required, before further investigations (which might result in exposure of healthcare staff) are performed. A high index of suspicion and  close  liaison  with  specialists  are  necessary  to  manage  such patients appropriately.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Cutaneous myiasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The diagnosis is cutaneous furuncular myiasis caused by the larva of the Tumbu fly, *Cordylobia anthropophaga*. This was confirmed by the characteristic clinical presentation of a slowly evolving, itchy boil in a traveler returning from Ghana, and the successful extraction of the maggot after occlusive therapy. The pulsating appearance of the larva's respiratory spiracles upon close inspection was a key diagnostic feature, effectively ruling out a bacterial abscess or other causes of eschar.\\nVitals: The patient was afebrile.

The lesion was described as itchy but not painful. There was no history of fever or other systemic symptoms, and the patient was otherwise feeling fine. She did not recall any specific arthropod bites.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Mayaro fever\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was Mayaro fever, caused by Mayaro virus (MAYV). This was confirmed by serological testing showing a positive Mayaro IgM-IFA (1280 on 29 August, 40 on 12 September) and IgG-IFA (2560 on both dates) with a confirmatory plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) that rose from 40 to 160. The diagnosis aligns with the patient's travel history to the Amazon Basin, the preceding dengue-like febrile illness, and the characteristic prolonged symmetrical polyarthralgias primarily affecting small peripheral joints, while other common travel-related viral and bacterial causes were ruled out by serology.\\nVitals: No specific vital signs were reported other than the occurrence of an acute febrile illness with chills.\\nContent: During the second week of a 3.5-week trip to the Amazon Basin of northern Peru, the patient developed an acute febrile illness with chills, malaise, frontal headache, generalized myalgia, and a transient, non-pruritic maculopapular rash. The rash began on the forearms about 1 week after fever onset, spread to the trunk, neck, and face, and faded after 3 days. Slowly progressive, debilitating polyarthralgias affecting peripheral joints, with transient joint swelling, also developed. Painful cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy lasted for about 1 week. Fever and other acute symptoms subsided within 1 week, but polyarthralgias persisted, showing a symmetrical pattern mainly affecting the small joints of the hands and feet, wrists, ankles, and knees. Upon return to Switzerland a few weeks later, the patient reported stiffness of the affected joints, mainly in the morning and after immobility, and the joint pains did not improve for two more months.\\n---\\n[MALARIA]\\nContent: Malaria may become symptomatic after the initial post-travel period, and so all returned travelers from malaria-endemic areas should be educated  about  nonspecific  symptoms  and  signs,  especially  fever, during the first few months after return. They should be advised to seek  an  early  medical  opinion  and  inform  health  professionals  of their travel history, should these symptoms occur.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

Acute infectious  diarrhea  can  be  classified  into  watery  diarrhea  and  bloody diarrhea (dysentery) (Box 3.1). Noninfectious causes of acute diarrhea are less significant in the tropics, but causes that should be considered include toxin-induced (e.g. organophosphate poisoning), medicationrelated and ischemic colitis. The most important physical signs to be\\n---\\n[UNCOMPLICATED MALARIA]\\nContent: Uncomplicated malaria illness  is  by  far the  most  common  clinical manifestation of a malaria infection and fever, or history of fever, is the most common symptom. There are no pathognomonic signs by which 'uncomplicated malaria' can be distinguished from common viral causes  of  fever  (Box  96.2).  The  presence  of  malaria  parasitemia increases the odds of a causal connection, especially in non-immune individuals, where peripheral parasitemia is nearly always associated with symptoms. Many semi-immune individuals (generally long-term residents  of  malaria-endemic  areas)  can  harbor  parasites  without becoming symptomatic and, in these individuals, peripheral blood parasitemia may well be 'incidental' to the symptoms [12]. In practical terms, symptomatic, parasitemic individuals who are alert enough to take oral medications are considered to have 'uncomplicated malaria' .\\nImportant  aspects  of  the  clinical  history  include  travel  itinerary, malaria precautions (chemoprophylaxis, use of bed nets and repellents) and recent prior treatment with anti-malarial drugs. The physical exam is useful for identifying other potential etiologies. In endemic areas,  the  presence  of  hepato-  or  splenomegaly  tilt  the  differential diagnosis  toward  malaria,  as  does  thrombocytopenia.  For  nonimmune travelers, the presence of fever, splenomegaly, hyperbilirubinemia and thrombocytopenia make malaria more likely [13].\\nCommon presenting signs are generalized constitutional symptoms including  fever,  chills,  dizziness,  backache,  myalgia,  malaise  and fatigue (frequently summarized as 'total body pain' by endemic-area adults). Gastrointestinal symptoms (i.e. anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea) can be prominent, causing confusion with  gastroenteritis.  Patients  may  have  nonproductive  cough  and dyspnea, consistent with acute respiratory infections. Young children and semi-immune adults may present with only fever and headache.\\n---\\n[INTESTINAL OR ENTERAL PHASE]\\nContent: The initial consequences of infection occur within the first week after ingestion of larval worms in inadequately cooked meat (Table 1 15-2). The symptoms, reflecting mucosal irritation as adult worms develop in  the  small  intestine,  include  nausea,  abdominal  cramps,  loss  of appetite, vomiting, low-grade fever, and either mild diarrhea or constipation. Frontal headaches, dizziness, and weakness can also occur, especially in light to moderate infections. Severe diarrhea, persisting for weeks, can be seen in heavy infections. Infected Inuit Indians in North America experience an unusually high frequency of diarrhea and a low frequency of myalgia. This may reflect chronic exposure and the development of intestinal immunity [4].\\n---\\n[STEPHEN G WRIGHT]\\nContent: frequently identified agent and travel to South Asia, the highest risk [6]. Although parasites are considered more common with chronic disease, bacterial diarrhea can also persist beyond a week [8].\\nWhile Giardia is the commonest parasitic cause of persisting diarrhea, Cryptosporidium spp. and, less  commonly, Cyclospora cayetanensis are also  recognized.  Amebiasis  is  uncommon  in  short-term  travelers, being  typically  seen  in  long-term  travelers  or  expatriates.  Intestinal helminths usually do not cause diarrheal symptoms with low worm burdens. Acute hookworm infection can occasionally be associated\\nTABLE 146-1 Causes of Persistent Diarrhea in Returned Travelers*\\n\\nDiarrhea with weight loss, Possible causes = Giardiasis Cryptosporidosis Cyclospora Hookworm infection (uncommon) Whipworm infection Strongyloidiasis (less common with GI symptoms) Celiac disease (gluten sensitive enteropathy) HIV/AIDS Tropical sprue (rare) In=ammatory bowel disease Colonic cancer Pancreatic disease Anatomical causes (diverticula, strictures, blind loops).

H. pylori infection may be asymptomatic, but a wide range of symptoms, including abdominal pain,  weight  loss,  nausea,  dyspepsia,  vomiting,  and  bloating,  have been attributed to this infection. H. pylori does cause chronic gastritis and increases the risk of duodenal and gastric ulcers, and persistent infection  increases  the  risk  of  gastric  cancer.  Treatment  is  recommended for those with gastric ulcer disease or malignancy; treatment for  other  clinical  manifestations  associated  with H.  pylori infection remains controversial [1 1].\\nInfection with intestinal nematodes is common among immigrants from developing countries and may cause abdominal pain, though often  is  asymptomatic.  The  hookworms Ancylostoma  duodenale and Necator americanus may be associated with anemia and protein deficiency due to blood loss. Ascaris lumbricoides can cause an impaired nutritional status, especially in children. Trichuris trichiura can cause pus-filled, bloody stools and rectal prolapse.\\nDiarrhea in immigrants may be the result of bacterial, viral, or parasitic infection. Time since arrival, recent exposures, and specific clinical symptoms help focus the evaluation appropriately. Giardia lamblia , a common cause of diarrhea in children, is more often asymptomatic in  immigrants.  Chronic  diarrhea  or  epigastric  pain,  particularly  in the immunosuppressed, can suggest a diagnosis of Strongyloides stercoralis [12].\\nEntamoeba histolytica may be asymptomatic, but has the potential to cause invasive disease if not diagnosed and treated. This parasite is associated with a dysentery-like illness, with blood or pus in the stool along with abdominal pain and fever. Liver abscess can present with fever, right upper quadrant pain, weight loss, hepatomegaly, and jaundice.  It  usually  presents  within  several  months  of  departure  from endemic areas and occurs frequently in  young men. Most cases  of amebic dysentery or liver abscess in the US originate from Mexico, but other Latin American countries, South Africa, India, and Southeast Asia also have high rates of amebic disease.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

I haven't traveled recently, but I do a lot of gardening barefoot in the summer (I live in the rural Southern U.S.). Could this be an allergy or something else?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Cutaneous larva migrans\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is cutaneous larva migrans (CLM), caused by the accidental infestation of human skin by larvae of dog and cat hookworms. This was diagnosed clinically based on the pathognomonic finding of pruritic, serpiginous tracks on the skin, supported by a clear exposure history of skin contact with sand in an endemic area (Thailand/Australia). The diagnosis was confirmed by the rapid and complete resolution of symptoms after a single dose of ivermectin.\\nContent: The patient developed three intensely itchy skin eruptions on both upper thighs just after arriving in Australia, one week prior to presentation. The itch was so severe that it kept him awake at night. He reported no fever, cough, or wheeze and was otherwise completely well.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Stevens-Johnson syndrome\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), a severe drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction. This clinical diagnosis is based on the patient's generalized maculopapular rash with extensive mucous membrane involvement (oral, conjunctival, genital), which appeared approximately four weeks after starting nevirapine and co-trimoxazole, both of which are highly implicated drugs. The diagnosis is further supported by the much higher incidence of SJS in HIV-positive individuals. Infectious causes like malaria were ruled out with negative testing.\\nVitals: Temperature is 37.7°C (99.9°F), blood pressure is 120/68 mmHg, pulse is 90 bpm, and respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute.\\nContent: The patient developed a productive cough with whitish sputum, followed one day later by a generalized skin rash that started on her trunk and spread to the extremities and mucosal membranes. Over the past two days, she also developed a sore throat and dysuria. The rash involves her lips, oral mucosa, conjunctivae, and genital mucosa, and has made talking and eating difficult and painful.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Spinal tuberculosis (Pott's disease)\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is presumed spinal tuberculosis (Pott's disease). This is based on the chronic, progressive spastic paraparesis with a thoracic sensory level in a patient from a TB-endemic region who is also HIV-positive. The diagnosis is strongly supported by the spinal radiograph showing collapse of the T11 vertebral body and a paravertebral soft tissue mass, which are characteristic findings. Schistosomiasis was ruled out with negative stool and urine tests, and the insidious onset made acute transverse myelitis less likely.\\nVitals: On a visit three months after symptom onset, his temperature was slightly elevated at 37.5 °C (99.5 °F). Upon admission to the tertiary hospital, he was afebrile with normal vital signs.\\nContent: The illness began one year prior with back pain. Over the following weeks, he developed difficulty walking and a 'pins and needles' sensation in his legs. Three months after onset, he presented to a health centre with a temperature of 37.5 °C and was given antimalarials and praziquantel. He also consulted a traditional healer. His condition progressively deteriorated over the next six months, eventually leaving him bedridden. The patient denies constitutional symptoms such as fever, night sweats, weight loss, or chronic cough. He has no haematuria or diarrhoea and is continent for stool and urine.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Visceral leishmaniasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar), caused by a Leishmania protozoan. This diagnosis is supported by the patient's presentation with chronic undulating fever, severe malnutrition, splenomegaly, generalized lymphadenopathy, and pancytopenia. Epidemiological risk was high, as she was from a known endemic area with a family history of the disease. Although an initial rK39 RDT was negative, the diagnosis was confirmed by a positive Direct Agglutination Test (DAT) with a high titre of 1:6400 and a definitive clinical response to treatment with liposomal amphotericin B.\\nVitals: On presentation, her vital signs were: temperature 39.6°C (103.3°F), pulse 96 bpm, and blood pressure 100/60 mmHg.\\nContent: For the past four weeks, the patient has experienced an undulating fever, occurring mainly in the afternoon, accompanied by chills and occasional convulsions. Initially, she was well between febrile episodes and played normally. However, over time she has developed progressive anorexia, a dry cough, chest pain, and joint and back pain.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Amoebic liver abscess\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is an amoebic liver abscess, caused by Entamoeba histolytica. This is supported by the clinical triad of fever and tender hepatomegaly with right intercostal tenderness, imaging findings of a large solitary liver lesion with an elevated hemidiaphragm, and the aspiration of characteristic 'brownish pus'. The diagnosis was further confirmed by the patient's rapid clinical response to metronidazole therapy and the relevant epidemiological risk factor of consuming locally brewed alcohol known to be associated with amoebiasis.\\nVitals: On examination, the patient's temperature was 38.3 °C (100.8 °F), blood pressure was 100/80 mmHg, pulse was 102 bpm, and respiratory rate was 24 breath cycles per minute.\\nContent: For the past week, the patient experienced fever, chills, headache, and body aches, along with severe right-hypochondrial pain. The abdominal pain is described as constant, dull, radiating to the right shoulder, and exacerbated by coughing and resting on the right side.

It  is  a  syndrome  that  may  be  caused  by Candida species, erythrasma or Gram-negative bacteria, as well as by dermatophytes. In dermatophyte infections, the area between the toes may be wet or dry and, in some infections, particularly those caused by Trichophyton interdigitale , vesicular. Involvement of the dorsum of the foot or the sole may occur. The commonest cause is T. rubrum .\\nSymptoms may be minimal. It is more common in people who wear shoes and socks and is therefore associated with urban areas in the tropics.\\nTinea pedis in tropical areas must be distinguished from eczema and, less commonly, plantar psoriasis [4]. The interplay between bacteria and fungi is poorly understood but, in the tropics, secondary Gramnegative bacterial infection on top of interdigital dermatophytosis can occur.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Tungiasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is tungiasis, an infestation caused by the burrowing female sand flea, Tunga penetrans. The diagnosis was made clinically based on the pathognomonic appearance of a dark nodule on the toe with a central ulceration, the history of white oval granules (eggs) emerging with pressure, and strong epidemiological links, including living on a farm in an endemic region of Bolivia with a similarly affected family member.\\nContent: The patient presented with a slowly growing nodule on the fifth toe of her right foot over several days, causing moderate pain when wearing shoes. Her parents reported that when they tried to squeeze the lesion, they observed white oval granules emerging from the nodule.\\n---\\n[CHIEF COMPLAINT]\\nDisease: Human African Trypanosomiasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is first-stage East African Trypanosomiasis caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. This was definitively confirmed by the microscopic demonstration of 5 to 10 trypanosomes per high power field on a thick blood film. The diagnosis is supported by the epidemiological link to a national game park in Malawi with tsetse fly exposure, and the clinical signs of fever, rash, and a trypanosomal chancre.

The envenomation was most likely caused by an African puff-adder (*Bitis arietans*), based on the snake's distinct physical description, its behavior, the geographic location in Malawi, and the clinical presentation of severe local cytotoxic effects (haemorrhagic bullae, massive swelling, extensive necrosis) and initial systemic haematotoxicity (bleeding gums). The patient's septic shock on arrival was a late complication of the untreated necrotic wound.\\nVitals: On admission, the patient appeared weak and was in respiratory distress. His temperature was 39.4 °C, pulse 126 bpm, blood pressure 85/60 mmHg, and respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute.\\nContent: There was an extensive, foul-smelling necrosis affecting his right foot and ankle, with exposed tendons. The right lower leg was swollen, and he was unable to bend his right ankle. Inguinal lymph nodes on the right side were enlarged.

My doctor ruled out MS (Multiple Sclerosis), but the symptoms are getting worse. Could this be a virus I picked up years ago?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[GENERAL]\\nContent: HAM/TSP develops in 1-4% of individuals infected with HTLV-1 over their lifetime and is the most common neurologic manifestation of HTLV-1 infection. Although most cases are caused by HTLV-I, a small number of patients infected with HTLV-II have also developed HAM/ TSP.

For unknown reasons,  women  progress  faster  than  men,  especially  those  who develop disease prior to menopause. Other risk factors for more rapid progression include older age at disease onset and increased HTLV-1 proviral  loads  [6,  9,  10].  HTLV-II-associated  disease  appears  to  be milder and have a more slowly progressive course.\\nThe association of HTLV-1 and HAM/TSP was first noted in tropical regions  of  the  Caribbean  and  South  America  (hence  the  original name:  tropical  spastic  paraparesis).  While  HAM/TSP  is  most  commonly seen in the Caribbean, South America, and southern Japan, the relative risk of developing HAM/TSP seems to be higher in Latin America than in Japan [3, 1 1].\\n---\\n[KEY SYNDROMES AND CLINICAL APPROACH]\\nContent: Peripheral nerve syndromes are the most frequent of the neuromuscular disorders encountered. The most common causes are diabetes, HIV, leprosy, drugs, toxins and nutritional deficiencies [although the complete list is much longer (Box 10.12)]. Identifying drug, toxin and nutritional causes rapidly is important as it will obviate the need for extensive investigations, and removal of the offending drug or toxin will stop progression and result in recovery if identified early enough. Similarly, treatment with the appropriate vitamins and nutrients will stop progression and help with recovery, although this may not be complete. Nowadays, and especially in the tropics, HIV, which can affect all areas of the neuro-axis, including nerve and muscle, features high on every list of differential diagnosis. Furthermore, as much of the  developing  world  has  a  growing  middle  class  who  are  rapidly adopting Western lifestyles and diets with fast foods and less exercise, diabetes and obesity are an increasing problem with the well-known consequences.\\nThe prevalence of relatively common neuromuscular conditions such as Guillain-Barré  syndrome (GBS), chronic inflammatory demyelinating  polyneuropathy  (CIDP),  polymyositis  and  myasthenia  gravis (MG) is  unknown  in  the  'tropics' .  For  the  most  part,  there  is  no reason why they should be more or less prevalent; however, the acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) form of GBS, which is often associated with Campylobacter jejuni infection, was, at one time, especially common in China, probably because of the way domestic chickens were housed.\\nNeuro-anatomically, lesions may involve anterior horn cell (causing a  motor  neuronopathy),  nerve  root  (radiculopathy),  dorsal  root ganglion  (sensory neuronopathy), brachial or  lumbo-sacral plexus, sensory  and  motor  nerve,  motor  nerve  only,  sensory  nerve  only (large  and/or  small  fibers),  neuromuscular  junction  and  muscle (Fig. 10.2).\\n---\\n[OTHER CONDITIONS RELATED TO HTLV INFECTION]\\nContent: A myriad  of  infectious  diseases  including  Norwegian  scabies, molluscum  contagiosum,  extrapulmonary  histoplasmosis,  tuberculosis, leprosy, and strongyloidiasis are described in case reports and series of HTLV-1-infected persons. A review of over 1200 blood donors in the  USA  revealed  a  significantly  higher  incidence  of  kidney  and bladder infections with HTLV-I infection. HTLV-II-infection was associated with higher incidence of bronchitis, bladder or kidney infections, and oral herpes. There was also a trend toward higher incidence of pneumonia in HTLV-II patients [2].\\nDermatologic alterations are commonly seen in the setting of HTLV infection and include dermatophyte infections, seborrheic dermatitis, acquired  ichthyosis,  infective  dermatitis  (Fig.  34.9.4),  scabies,  and others.\\nPatients with HTLV-1 also have an increased incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium infections, as well as decreased skin response rates to purified protein derivative. Increased rates of HTLV-1 infections are also seen among residents of Hansen's disease sanatoriums in Africa [16].\\nOther neurologic syndromes, which do not meet the case definition of  HAM/TSP,  include  leg  weakness,  impaired  gait,  hyper-reflexia, impaired vibratory sense, and urinary tract abnormalities [1].\\nA  myriad  of  rheumatologic  conditions  are  described  with  HTLV-1 detected  in  target  tissues.  These  conditions  include  polymyositis, bronchioalveolar pneumonitis, Sjögren's syndrome autoimmune thyroiditis, uveitis, and arthropathy [6, 7].\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Approximately 80% of human WNV infections are asymptomatic [7]. In clinical infections, the incubation period usually is 2-6 days, but can be up to 21 days in immunocompromised people. Most symptomatic persons experience an acute systemic febrile illness that often includes headache, myalgia or arthralgia; gastrointestinal symptoms and a transient maculopapular rash also are commonly reported. Less than  1%  of  infected  people  develop  neuroinvasive  disease,  which typically manifests as meningitis, encephalitis, or acute flaccid paralysis.  Patients  with  encephalitis  may  present  with  seizures,  mental status changes, focal neurologic deficits or movement disorders. WNV acute flaccid paralysis is often clinically and pathologically identical to  poliomyelitis  caused  by  polioviruses,  with  damage  of  anterior horn cells in the spinal cord (anterior myelitis); it  may progress to respiratory paralysis requiring mechanical ventilation. WNVassociated Guillain-Barré syndrome has also been reported and can be distinguished from WNV myelitis by clinical manifestations and electrophysiologic testing. Cardiac dysrhythmias, myocarditis, rhabdomyolysis, optic neuritis, uveitis, chorioretinitis, orchitis, pancreatitis and hepatitis have been rarely described after WNV infection.\\nMost  patients  with  WNV  non-neuroinvasive  disease  or  meningitis recover completely, but fatigue, malaise and weakness can linger for weeks or months [7, 8]. Patients who recover from WNV encephalitis or  myelitis  often  have  residual  neurologic  deficits.  Among  patients with  neuroinvasive  disease,  the  overall  case-fatality  rate  is  approximately 10%, but it is significantly higher in WNV encephalitis and myelitis than in WNV meningitis. Risk factors for developing neuroinvasive disease include older age and history of solid organ transplantation;  other  immunocompromising  conditions,  diabetes,  and hypertension are suspected risk factors.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Neurolathyrism\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is neurolathyrism, a preventable toxic myelopathy caused by excessive ingestion of the grass pea, Lathyrus sativus. This is supported by the classic clinical presentation of an irreversible, acute-onset spastic paraparesis without sensory or sphincter involvement. The diagnosis is strongly corroborated by the epidemiological context: the patient's diet consisted almost exclusively of grass peas during a famine, he was a young male performing hard physical labor, and other young men in his village were similarly affected. Alternative diagnoses such as other tropical myelopathies were ruled out by the specific clinical features and exposure history.\\nContent: Ten years ago, the patient woke from sleep and noticed weakness in both legs, with no preceding trauma or prodromal symptoms. The weakness progressed rapidly over 4 to 5 days, after which he required a cane for mobility. The condition has been stable since. He reported no back pain, sensory complaints, sphincter disturbance, or upper limb symptoms.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

Toxin-induced  secretory  diarrhea  continues  independent  of  food intake. Malabsorption of carbohydrate in the small intestine leads to fermentation of unabsorbed substrates by colonic bacteria; this may cause bloating, the passage of much rectal gas and frothy stools, which are all characteristic of giardiasis. Cryptosporidiosis can involve both small and large bowel, causing short-lived and self-limiting diarrhea; however, the infection can be prolonged in patients with impaired immune responses. Cyclospora cayetanensis can also cause  acute and more chronic diarrhea with abnormalities of intestinal absorption.\\nFrequent  bowel  movements  with  small  volumes  of  stool  and  the passage  of  blood  and  mucus  suggest  colonic  infection.  Causes  of bloody diarrhea (dysentery) include invasive bacteria such as Campylobacter spp., enterohemorrhagic E. coli , and Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia spp.; nonbacterial causes include Entamoeba histolytica (amebic dysentery) and Balantidium coli , which is spread by close contact with pigs. Colicky abdominal pain is common in many gut infections and is especially severe in campylobacteriosis and yersiniosis, mimicking acute appendicitis. Fever, chills and generalized myalgia are usually associated with infection by invasive organisms; these patients appear ill and have generalized abdominal tenderness.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS]\\nContent: The onset of symptoms can vary from a few hours after ingesting food containing preformed toxins, to several days after ingesting bacterial pathogens, to two or more weeks in parasitic infections. Acute infectious  diarrhea  can  be  classified  into  watery  diarrhea  and  bloody diarrhea (dysentery) (Box 3.1). Noninfectious causes of acute diarrhea are less significant in the tropics, but causes that should be considered include toxin-induced (e.g. organophosphate poisoning), medicationrelated and ischemic colitis.

Diarrhea  may  sometimes  become  bloody. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance may follow and, in severe cases, renal dysfunction  might  ensue.  Occasionally,  cholinergic  symptoms  are observed.\\n---\\n[GASTROINTESTINAL IRRITANTS]\\nContent: Ingestion of  many  plants  may  cause  gastroenteritic  symptoms (abdominal colic, vomiting, and diarrhea) as the sole toxic manifestation.\\nOxalic acid and calcium oxalate crystals occur in a number of popular decorative  plants,  such  as  'dumb  cane'  ( Dieffenbachia spp.),  'elephant's ear' ( Philodenron spp.) and 'cuckoo pint' ( Arum maculatum ). The  crystals  cause  intense  irritation  of  mucous  membranes  in  the mouth, esophagus, stomach and intestine. Increased salivation, reddening, blistering, and dysphagia may ensue. Other decorative plants, for example Euphorbia and Daphne spp. contain highly irritating diterpene esters that cause burning sensations and pain in the mucous membranes  of  the  gastrointestinal  tract  and  are,  in  general,  most pronounced in mouth and pharynx. Other symptoms are increased salivation, reddening and blisters.\\nSome of these toxins may also cause skin lesions and minor renal damage (see below).\\nTreatment is with oral fluids to rinse and dilute the irritant material, together with symptomatic care as required.\\n---\\n[COMPLICATIONS]\\nContent: The leading cause of death in patients with acute diarrhea is dehydration, which requires prompt fluid and electrolyte replacement. The nutritional state of children  often  deteriorates  because of anorexia, nutrient malabsorption, and the practice of not feeding children who have diarrhea. Hypolactasia is a sequela of many gut infections and may cause persistent diarrhea. Dysentery can be associated with severe local complications such as hemorrhage, toxic megacolon and bowel\\nperforation.

They are mostly whitish and pinkish, and they look kind of scaly. I tried to tan them away at the beach, but the spots just stayed white while the rest of my skin got darker, making them look even more obvious. They also get a little itchy when I work out and get sweaty. What could be causing this?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[PHYSICAL EXAM]\\nDisease: Pellagra\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is Pellagra, a nutritional disorder caused by a deficiency of vitamin B3 (niacin). The diagnosis was made clinically based on the characteristic triad of photosensitive dermatitis, watery diarrhoea, and neuropsychiatric symptoms ('dementia'). The diagnosis was confirmed by the rapid resolution of her confusion and diarrhoea following supplementation with a vitamin B-complex. Her poor, maize-based diet provided a strong epidemiological link, and other key differential diagnoses like HIV were ruled out by testing.\\nVitals: The patient is afebrile. Her Glasgow Coma Scale is 14/15 due to confusion. Remaining vital signs are reported as normal.\\nContent: The patient is slim but not wasted. Her conjunctivae are pale. There is a noticeable, clearly demarcated skin rash on her neck ('Casal’s necklace'), forearms, hands, and feet, where the skin appears hyperpigmented, dry, and scaly. There is no neck stiffness, and the rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Stevens-Johnson syndrome\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), a severe drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction. This clinical diagnosis is based on the patient's generalized maculopapular rash with extensive mucous membrane involvement (oral, conjunctival, genital), which appeared approximately four weeks after starting nevirapine and co-trimoxazole, both of which are highly implicated drugs. The diagnosis is further supported by the much higher incidence of SJS in HIV-positive individuals. Infectious causes like malaria were ruled out with negative testing.\\nVitals: Temperature is 37.7°C (99.9°F), blood pressure is 120/68 mmHg, pulse is 90 bpm, and respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute.\\nContent: The patient developed a productive cough with whitish sputum, followed one day later by a generalized skin rash that started on her trunk and spread to the extremities and mucosal membranes. Over the past two days, she also developed a sore throat and dysuria. The rash involves her lips, oral mucosa, conjunctivae, and genital mucosa, and has made talking and eating difficult and painful.\\n---\\n[PHYSICAL EXAM]\\nDisease: Crusted scabies\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was crusted scabies with secondary community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) sepsis. The crusted scabies was confirmed by microscopy of skin scrapings showing numerous mites and eggs. The secondary MRSA bacteremia was confirmed by blood cultures. The diagnosis was further supported by her clinical presentation of a classic hyperkeratotic rash with signs of septic shock and her complete recovery following targeted anti-scabietic and antibiotic therapy.\\nVitals: On initial presentation, her temperature was 39.5 °C (103.1 °F), heart rate was 110 bpm, respiratory rate was 28 breaths per minute, and blood pressure was 85 mmHg systolic. Her oxygen saturation was 92% on room air.\\nContent: The patient was pale, clammy, and poorly responsive. She had a widespread exfoliative rash involving all limbs, with particular severity in the armpits, buttocks, and thighs. Numerous flakes of skin were present on her mattress. She also had fissures over her wrists and knees.\\n---\\n[DISSEMINATED PRURITUS WITH OR WITHOUT RASH]\\nContent: Scabies is the most common cause of diffuse pruritic skin disease [4]. The patient complains of generalized and intense itching, worsening at  night,  usually  sparing  the  face  and  head.  Specific  skin  findings include 5- to 10-mm burrows, and papulonodular genital lesions. The classic  distribution of lesions are the interdigital web spaces, flexor surfaces of the wrists, the elbows, the axillae, the buttocks and genitalia, and on the breasts of women. Other skin changes are secondary to pruritus and include excoriation and lichenification.\\nCiguatera is a cause of localized pruritic neurosensory manifestations (perioral and distal extremity paresthesias) without cutaneous manifestations. There should be a history of fish consumption, other cases among travelers sharing the  same  meal,  a  short  incubation  period\\n(2-30 hours), and the association of gastrointestinal and neurological signs. The latter can last for months after the initial event. This fish poisoning is acquired by the ingestion of fish containing the toxins produced by the dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus toxicus , which is found in damaged coral reef systems in tropical and subtropical regions.\\nSeabather's eruption (also called sea lice) is a highly pruritic maculopapular  eruption  that  occurs  after  swimming  in  the  ocean  and  is generally confined to the skin under swimwear. It is caused by larval forms of sea  anemones  (e.g. Edwardsiella  lineata )  and  jellyfish  (e.g. Linuche unguiculata ) that become trapped under swimwear.\\nCercarial dermatitis (swimmer's itch) is also a pruritic maculopapular eruption but is predominantly distributed on uncovered body areas. It  results  from  penetration  of  the  skin  by  cercariae  of  nonhuman schistosomes while swimming in fresh water. It can last for several days.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Cutaneous larva migrans\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is cutaneous larva migrans (CLM), caused by the accidental infestation of human skin by larvae of dog and cat hookworms. This was diagnosed clinically based on the pathognomonic finding of pruritic, serpiginous tracks on the skin, supported by a clear exposure history of skin contact with sand in an endemic area (Thailand/Australia). The diagnosis was confirmed by the rapid and complete resolution of symptoms after a single dose of ivermectin.\\nContent: The patient developed three intensely itchy skin eruptions on both upper thighs just after arriving in Australia, one week prior to presentation. The itch was so severe that it kept him awake at night.

Could this be dandruff or something else?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[TINEA CAPITIS (RINGWORM OF THE SCALP)]\\nContent: Invasion of scalp hairs is seen with certain dermatophytes. In some, particularly those spread from animals, scalp hairs often break several millimeters above  the  skin  surface.  There  can  be  considerable exudation  and  erythema.  In  other  infections,  including  many  of those spread from child to child, the onset is insidious. Hairs break at scalp level and inflammation can be minimal. Most cases present with hair loss, usually in patches, and a varying degree of scaling (Fig. 77.4).  However,  kerions  (very  inflammatory  pustular  lesions)  can develop.\\nFIGURE 77.4 Tinea capitis, caused by Microsporum audouinii , presents with multiple patches of alopecia with scaling in this boy (image courtesy of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Photograph Neg. 7-6860).\\nFavus,  a  scalp  infection  seen  in  some  parts  of  Africa,  for  example Ethiopia,  presents with hair loss accompanied by the formation of crusts  or  scutula.  These  tend  to  coalesce  to  form  a  dense  mat  in patches or large areas of the scalp. The diagnosis of tinea capitis is facilitated  by  filtered  ultraviolet  light  examination  (Wood's  light), although only Microsporum species fluoresce under these conditions. Ringworm of the scalp must be distinguished from seborrheic dermatitis,  psoriasis,  or  cicatricial  alopecia.  The  last  may  be  produced  in end-stage favus.\\n---\\n[PHYSICAL EXAM]\\nDisease: Measles\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is measles, caused by a paramyxovirus. This was determined clinically based on the pathognomonic triad of cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis, followed by the characteristic maculopapular rash starting behind the ears and spreading to the trunk. The patient's HIV-positive status predisposed him to severe complications, including pneumonia and encephalitis (suggested by the low Blantyre Coma Scale). The diagnosis was supported by the exclusion of malaria via negative smears.\\nVitals: On examination, the patient had a temperature of 39.8° C (103.6 °F) and was noted to have laboured breathing.\\nContent: The patient was a sick child with a Blantyre coma score of 3/5. Examination revealed coryza and bilateral conjunctivitis. A fine maculopapular rash was present behind both ears and on the forehead. There was also bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy. Koplik's spots were not reported.\\n---\\n[PHYSICAL EXAM]\\nDisease: Onchocerciasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is onchocerciasis (river blindness), caused by the filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus. The diagnosis was established based on the highly typical clinical triad of chronic pruritic dermatitis, subcutaneous nodules over bony prominences, and characteristic corneal opacities (sclerosing keratitis). This is strongly supported by the patient's lifelong residency in an endemic region of Togo near a fast-flowing river, the known breeding site for the Simulium blackfly vector.\\nContent: Examination reveals opacities in the cornea of both eyes, described as keratitis semilunaris, a form of band-shaped sclerosing keratopathy. The skin appears atrophic in some areas with loss of elasticity, and there are multiple scratch marks. Multiple firm, non-tender subcutaneous nodules, measuring 1 to 3 cm in diameter, are palpable over bony prominences including the ribs, iliac crest, femoral trochanters, and on the head.\\n---\\n[PAPULOSQUAMOUS AND ECZEMATOID LESIONS]\\nContent: Papulosquamous  lesions  are  rashes  that  are  both  raised  and  have scale, such as psoriasis and tinea corporis (Table 8-1). In tineasis, the dermatophytes Microsporum , Trichophyton and Epidermophyton infect keratinized  tissue.  Characteristically,  they  appear  as  erythematous, annular plaques, with serpiginous borders, with scale at the leading edge,  and  are  named  based  on  the  location  of  involvement:  tinea capitis - scalp; tinea corporis - body; tinea faciei - face; tinea cruris -  groin;  tinea  pedis  -  feet;  tinea  manuum  -  hand;  tinea  barbae  beard;  tinea  unguium -  nails. Diagnosis  can  be  confirmed  by  performing a  scraping  of  the  scale  and  applying  one  or  two  drops  of potassium  hydroxide  (KOH)  and  visualizing  the  hyphal  structures under  10 × magnification.  The  differential  diagnosis  includes  other papulosquamous or scaly raised lesions (see Table 8-1). For limited disease, topical antifungals are usually effective, except for tinea capitis and onychomycosis, which often require oral antifungal medications. As  recurrence  is  common,  multiple  courses  of  therapy  are  often required.\\nTinea capitis causes circular, scaly patches on the scalp with alopecia and black dots caused by breakage of the hair shaft. Some causative species such as Microsporum audouinii fluoresce on Wood's lamp examination. Favus is a particular type of tinea capitis which causes yellow, concave  cup-shaped  crusts  on  the  scalp  around  loose  hairs  and  is caused by T. schoenleinii . There is a characteristic mousy odor which aids  in  the  diagnosis.

The failure to respond to treatment for nephrotic syndrome and subsequent rapid improvement with therapeutic feeding confirmed the nutritional etiology.\\nContent: The patient is apathetic with a puffy face and pitting oedema on the lower legs.

They seem to burst and then crust over with a honey-colored scab. He’s been scratching them a lot, and now I see a few similar spots starting on his hands. It’s warm and humid right now, so I thought it might be bug bites, but they look different. What could this be?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Bites,  for  example  by  the  large  aggressive  flies  variously  known  as horse flies, gadflies or cleggs (Tabanidae), may be immediately painful and traumatic but the commonest problem is delayed local swelling and itching from exposure to insects' salivary allergens incurred by previous bites. A small, intensely itchy, reddish lump with a central (hemorrhagic)  punctum  develops  immediately  or  after  a  delay  of 24-48 hours. A papule, urticarial weal, blister or bulla may develop (e.g.  after  'Blandford  fly' Simulium posticatum bites  in  Oxfordshire, UK), or bites may provoke a more generalized erythema multiforme or,  especially  in  children,  papular  urticaria,  and  sometimes  even systemic  anaphylaxis  may  be  provoked.  Triatomine  bug  bites  are usually multiple - often near the eye or angle of the mouth. They are painful, swollen, ooze blood and may be surrounded by black staining from the bug's feces (see Chapter 98, 'Chagas' Disease'). Scratching may lead to secondary infection, an inflamed, painful pustule or carbuncle, or a demarcated, hot, bright red, raised area of erysipelas or cellulitis. Causative bacteria include Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes . The risk of secondary infection seems to be higher under humid tropical conditions. It may be difficult to distinguish between  envenoming  or  allergy,  resulting  in  early  symptoms  after minutes or a few hours, and infection, resulting in late symptoms after many hours or even days.\\nFIGURE 136.2.1 Bug bite, São Paulo, Brazil (© David A. Warrell).\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Burrows most commonly occur in the interdigital clefts between the fingers  and  on  the  wrists,  but  may  be  widespread  (Fig.  136.4.1). Tracks  are  serpiginous,  extending  for  a  few  millimeters  up  to  one centimeter,  creating  linear  papulovescular  lesions  with  excoriation, secondary  infection,  eczematization,  lichenification  and  erythematous papules. Lesions are intensely itchy, especially at night and after a  hot  bath  or  shower, provoking scratching -  excoriation that promotes secondary infection. In about 7% of cases, very itchy reddish brown  nodules  occur  on  the  genitalia,  groin,  buttocks  and  axillae (nodular scabies). In infants, vesicular, pustular and nodular lesions are found on the axillae, head, face, diaper region, palms and soles. An exuberantly crusting form, Norwegian scabies, occurs in patients immunosuppressed by HIV, human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-1 or by drugs employed in organ transplantation, and in people with trisomy-21. Demarcated, hyperkeratotic, scaly plaques involve, in particular,  the  extremities,  scalp,  face,  neck  and  buttocks.  The  scales contain thousands of mites and the load per patient may exceed 1 million mites. This type of scabies is very infectious and a single case can give rise to nosocomial outbreaks.\\n---\\n[HAND-FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE]\\nContent: Hand-foot-and-mouth disease occurs most often in children under 10 years of age. The illness commences with fever ( > 38.5°C) and sore throat. The fever lasts 1-2 days during which time vesicles appear on the  anterior  buccal  and  gingival  mucous  membranes  and  tongue. Cutaneous vesicles occur most frequently on palms of the hands and soles  of  the  feet,  but  may  also  occur  on  the  buttocks  and  extensor surfaces of the elbows and knees. The skin lesions of hand-foot-andmouth disease are typically tender vesicles with a surrounding zone of erythema (Fig. 34.2.4).\\n---\\n[FIXED LOCALIZED PAPULES AND NODULES]\\nContent: There are several causes of fixed papules and nodules (Box 147.3). Myiasis  and  tungiasis  are  among  the  most  common.  Myiasis  is infestation of human tissue by larvae or maggots of flies ( Diptera ). Furuncular  myiasis  (caused  by Cordylobia  anthropophaga in  subSaharan Africa and Dermatobia hominis in Central and South America)\\nFIGURE  147.2 Bullous  bacterial  cellulitis  complicating  an  insect  bite (return from Central Africa).\\nFIGURE 147.3 Limited post-bullous erosion of the leg (impetigo).\\nFIGURE 147.4 Large crusted cutaneous lesion of the thigh (ecthyma).\\nFIGURE  147.5 Abscess  of  the  leg  due  to  a  methicillin-susceptible  but Panton-Valentine-producing  strain  of Staphylococcus  aureus after  return from Ivory coast.\\nFIGURE  147.6 Cellulitis  of  the  calf  associated  with  a  cutaneous  trail  of lymphangitis.\\nFIGURE 147.7 Creeping dermatitis of the buttocks after return from French West Indies (hookworm-related cutaneous larva migrans).\\nFIGURE 147.8 Creeping dermatitis and folliculitis due to hookworm- related cutaneous larva migrans (return from Thailand).\\nFIGURE  147.8 Creeping  dermatitis  and  folliculitis  due  to  hookwormrelated cutaneous larva migrans (return from Thailand).\\nFIGURE 147.9 Chronic  cutaneous  ulcer  due  to  cutaneous  leishmaniasis (return  from  French  Guyana)  and  febrile  exanthem  associated  with  an adverse cutaneous drug reaction secondary to amoxicillin.\\n---\\n[PAINFUL PAPULES/URTICARIA]\\nContent: Infestation  of  skin  with  fly  larvae  is  called  myiasis.  A  large,  tender, cyst-like  structure  or  papule  may  be  noted  with  surrounding  erythema,  a  central  punctum  and  occasional  suppuration.  Patients usually report movement within the lesions. Lesions may be multiple. New World myiasis is caused by the botfly; Old World disease is most commonly caused by the tumbu fly. Treatment involves asphyxiating the  larvae,  usually  via  application  of  an  occlusive  dressing  or  substance, followed by larval extrusion. Surgical excision may sometimes be required. Bacterial suprainfection can occur.\\nTungiasis (also called jiggers) is caused by Tunga penetrans , the sand flea. The female flea burrows into skin, usually on the feet, but can involve any exposed skin area, creating a callus-like papule, often with some hyperpigmentation. The terminus of the flea is often visible in the center of the lesion. Pain is usually present. Treatment involves mechanical removal.\\nMany insect bites  and  plant  dermatitides  occur  in  the  tropics.  The physical  examination  is  often  helpful  at  suggesting  the  diagnosis. Insect bites may result in erythematous papules of variable size and distribution. Urticarial-like erythema is seen around lesions, at times enlarging far over 10 cm in diameter. A number of beetles, millipedes and  centipedes  can  cause  a  severe  contact  dermatitis.  Plant  dermatitides may manifest in both acute and chronic forms, depending on the repetitive nature of contact. Whereas contact dermatitis is the most  common  presentation,  characterized  by  vesicles  on  an  erythematous base in a linear or geographic distribution, chronic disease may present as eczematous dermatitis. Occupational disease, as seen in florists or gardeners, can present as atopic dermatitis of the hands, with severe dryness, scaling, cracking, erythema, and even fibrotic-like constriction in palmar function.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

This is based on the clinical syndrome of acute flaccid paraparesis with a T10 sensory level and bladder dysfunction, supported by cerebrospinal fluid evidence of inflammation (lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein). Extensive investigations, including serologies and CSF analysis, ruled out common infectious causes like HIV, syphilis, tuberculosis, and schistosomiasis. Normal spinal x-rays made a compressive lesion unlikely.\\nVitals: On presentation, vital signs were normal.\\nContent: The patient was well until two days prior to presentation, when she developed acute back pain that radiated in a band-like fashion to her umbilicus. The pain was severe, continuous, and burning. Within 12 hours, the pain subsided but she developed ascending numbness in her feet and legs up to her waist, followed by loss of leg power and bladder control. She reported a febrile illness three weeks previously, which was treated as malaria. There was no history of trauma.\\n---\\n[TREATMENT]\\nContent: Treatment is common to all wounds caused by venomous fish and includes: (i) pain relief; (ii) neutralizing effects of venom; (iii) prevention of secondary infection; and (iv) supportive care of systemic symptoms.  Immersion  of  the  stung  part  in  uncomfortably  hot,  but  not scalding, water (less than 45°C) relieves pain and neutralizes venom. Alternatively,  inject  local  anesthetic  as  a  ring  block  or  local  nerve block. The barbed venomous spine, its covering membrane and other foreign  material  should  be  removed  as  soon  as  possible.  Systemic effects  are  treated  symptomatically.

The patient was diagnosed with sepsis and managed according to international guidelines, including broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and ventilatory support. He received tetanus prophylaxis. The necrotic wound on his foot was managed surgically with several debridements, followed by successful mesh-grafting. He did not develop severe local complications such as compartment syndrome. The boy was discharged several weeks later with some residual functional impairment of his right foot, requiring outpatient physiotherapy.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

It  is  a  syndrome  that  may  be  caused  by Candida species, erythrasma or Gram-negative bacteria, as well as by dermatophytes. In dermatophyte infections, the area between the toes may be wet or dry and, in some infections, particularly those caused by Trichophyton interdigitale , vesicular. Involvement of the dorsum of the foot or the sole may occur. The commonest cause is T. rubrum .\\nSymptoms may be minimal. It is more common in people who wear shoes and socks and is therefore associated with urban areas in the tropics.\\nTinea pedis in tropical areas must be distinguished from eczema and, less commonly, plantar psoriasis [4].

However, neurologic symptoms are distinctive, suggesting some kind of neurotoxic seafood poisoning. Allergic reactions produce anaphylactic  symptoms  (pruritus,  urticaria,  erythema,  angioedema,  bronchospasm,  and  shock),  sometimes  within  minutes  of  ingestion.\\nUnless there is a past history of specific seafood allergy (e.g. to prawns, tuna) or an epidemiologic clue (several diners affected), it can be very difficult  to  distinguish  allergy  from  scombroid  poisoning,  but  the emergency treatment is the same for both etiologies.\\n---\\n[SEVERE DEHYDRATION ( ≥ 10% VOLUME LOSS)]\\nContent: - Decreased consciousness\\n- Hypotension\\n- Deep respirations with an increase in respiratory rate\\n- Cool extremities\\n- Peripheral cyanosis\\nelicited  concern the  assessment of hydration (Box 3.2); the patient should be weighed at first presentation, as weight gain or loss can be a valuable guide to the effectiveness of rehydration.\\nThe rapid onset of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea after food consumption is most often due to the ingestion of a preformed toxin produced by Staphylococcus aureus , Bacillus cereus or Clostridium perfringens .\\nLarge-volume watery diarrhea indicates a small bowel etiology, e.g. due  to V.  cholerae ,  enterotoxigenic E.  coli and  rotavirus  infections. Toxin-induced  secretory  diarrhea  continues  independent  of  food intake. Malabsorption of carbohydrate in the small intestine leads to fermentation of unabsorbed substrates by colonic bacteria; this may cause bloating, the passage of much rectal gas and frothy stools, which are all characteristic of giardiasis. Cryptosporidiosis can involve both small and large bowel, causing short-lived and self-limiting diarrhea; however, the infection can be prolonged in patients with impaired immune responses. Cyclospora cayetanensis can also cause  acute and more chronic diarrhea with abnormalities of intestinal absorption.\\nFrequent  bowel  movements  with  small  volumes  of  stool  and  the passage  of  blood  and  mucus  suggest  colonic  infection.  Causes  of bloody diarrhea (dysentery) include invasive bacteria such as Campylobacter spp., enterohemorrhagic E. coli , and Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia spp.; nonbacterial causes include Entamoeba histolytica (amebic dysentery) and Balantidium coli , which is spread by close contact with pigs. Colicky abdominal pain is common in many gut infections and is especially severe in campylobacteriosis and yersiniosis, mimicking acute appendicitis. Fever, chills and generalized myalgia are usually associated with infection by invasive organisms; these patients appear ill and have generalized abdominal tenderness.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: In  food-borne  disease,  the  neurologic  features  of  botulism  may  be preceded by abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, although at  the  time  of  neurologic  manifestation,  constipation  is  common. Such gastrointestinal  disturbance  has  not  been  reported  in  wound botulism and probably represents the effect of other bacteria and their toxins  co-contaminating  the  causative  improperly  preserved  food. Clinical  effects  of  botulinum  toxin  usually  become  evident  18-36 hours after consumption of the implicated foodstuff.\\n---\\n[SYMPTOMS]\\nContent: Gastrointestinal symptoms begin within a few hours post-exposure and disappear quickly.

Could I have picked up a parasite from the food?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS AND PATHOLOGY]\\nContent: Infection is spread by ingestion of several species of freshwater fish that have infectious larvae within muscle. The natural reservoir host has not been identified, but fish-eating water birds are probable. The custom  of  eating  raw  fish  probably  determines  transmission.  Outbreaks have occurred when fecal contamination of freshwater lagoons has allowed eggs from infected patients to be disseminated in large numbers to a local source of fish.\\nAfter  ingestion  of  infected  fish,  larvae  can  invade  the  small  bowel, causing a chronic malabsorption-diarrhea syndrome characterized by induration  and  villous  atrophy  which  is  most  prominent  in  the jejunum (Fig. 107.6).  Adult worms invade the mucosa and lamina propria. Although inflammation is not prominent around parasites, chronic inflammation is noted within the lamina propria. The small intestine can contain thousands of parasites because of the ability of the adult females to produce infectious larvae. The chronic, usually watery, diarrhea leads to electrolyte and protein abnormalities. Muscle wasting  and  myocardial  degeneration  ensue  terminally.  Death  has been attributed to hypokalemic or metabolic cardiomyopathy or to secondary infection of debilitated patients.\\n---\\n[MEDICAL HISTORY AND EXAMINATION]\\nContent: Within  endemic  areas,  schistosomiasis  must  be  suspected  in  all patients presenting any symptom, however vague, that can be related to the infection. In travelers and migrants, a careful residence or travel history can help establish the diagnosis of schistosomiasis [31, 33]. In several sub-Saharan areas, both S. mansoni and S. haematobium, and even S. intercalatum, can be contracted. The patient who has lived in,\\n877\\nor  visited,  endemic  areas  must  be  asked  about  skin  contact  with freshwater of any kind, even if considered locally as safe or snail-free. Contacts of any type or duration can lead to infection. The patient may, or may not, report itching or rash shortly after the water contact. Visual  inspection  may help  diagnose  'swimmers'  itch'  after  recent exposure.\\nA medical history may reveal intermittent symptoms since the potential exposure, including flu-like syndromes in the weeks or months thereafter. Malaise, fatigue,  muscle pains, appetite loss, intermittent diarrhea, vague abdominal pain and red or dark urine are potential warning signs - partly depending on the suspected species. A neurologic history and examination is performed to exclude early cerebrospinal involvement. Abdominal palpation may reveal hepatomegaly or  splenomegaly  of  varying  degrees  and  abdominal  tenderness  or distention, but also may be entirely negative.\\n---\\n[POISONING BY INGESTING CARP'S GALLBLADDER [4]]\\nContent: In parts of the Far East, the raw bile and gallbladder of various species of freshwater carp (e.g. grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idellus and Jullien's\\n133.3 Mushroom Poisoning\\nHans Persson golden carp Probarbus jullieni ) are believed to have medicinal properties.  Patients  in  China,  Taiwan,  Hong  Kong,  Japan,  Thailand  and elsewhere  have  developed  acute  abdominal  pain,  vomiting  and watery diarrhea 2-18 hours after drinking the raw bile or eating the raw  gallbladder  of  these  fish.  One  patient  developed  flushing  and dizziness.  Hepatic  and  renal  damage  may  develop,  progressing  to oliguric or non-oliguric acute  renal failure (acute  tubular necrosis).

Asymptomatic infections with Pseudoterranova spp.  may  come  to  medical  attention  when  the  patient coughs up a live or dead worm. This usually occurs within 48 hours of the ingestion of infected fish and may be preceded by a sensation of  feeling  a  worm  crawling  in  the  upper  esophagus  or  pharynx, termed 'tingling throat syndrome'.\\nGastric anisakiasis is heralded by the abrupt (generally 1-12 hours after  ingestion  of  raw  fish)  onset  of  severe  epigastric  pain,  nausea, vomiting, and low-grade fever (Fig. 121.3). There is frequently leukocytosis with intense eosinophilia. Untreated gastric disease may lead to  chronic,  ulcer-like  symptoms  and  can  be  more  difficult  to diagnose.\\nIntestinal  anisakiasis  is  characterized  by  intermittent  or  constant abdominal pain that may be severe enough to result in peritoneal signs or a partial bowel obstruction. Symptoms may not appear until 5 to 7 days or longer after ingestion of the anisakid larvae. Intestinal infections  predominantly  occur  in  the  terminal  ileum;  colonic  or jejunal  involvement  is  less  common.

I do eat my steaks rare and travel a lot for work. What could this be?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Giardiasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is giardiasis, caused by the protozoan parasite Giardia intestinalis. This was confirmed by direct microscopic identification of Giardia trophozoites and cysts in stool samples. The clinical presentation of greasy, foul-smelling stools, bloating, and evidence of carbohydrate malabsorption (positive reducing substances in stool) is classic for this infection.\\nVitals: The patient has no fever; no other vital signs are reported.\\nContent: For the past two weeks, the patient has experienced four to five episodes of loose stools per day, accompanied by weight loss, anorexia, malaise, flatulence, and abdominal cramping during defecation. For the last three days, he has noted bloating and distension after consuming milk products. While he has mild nausea, he reports no fever. His stools were initially watery, but after a 5-day course of ciprofloxacin from a local pharmacy (which ended two days ago), they are now three to four per day and described as mushy, greasy, and foul-smelling.\\n---\\n[ABDOMINAL DISTENSION]\\nContent: Abdominal distension may be due to gas, either within or outside the  bowel  lumen.  Extraluminal  gas  is  seen  in  bowel  perforation, which is a surgical emergency. Gaseous distension of the bowel may be due to mechanical obstruction or motility disorder. Bloating is a common symptom in lactose malabsorption, which is commonplace among Africans and Asians after childhood, and in irritable bowel syndrome.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Cholera\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is cholera, caused by Vibrio cholerae O1, Serotype Ogawa, biotype El Tor. This was established based on the classic clinical syndrome of profuse rice-water diarrhea leading to severe dehydration and shock, combined with a clear epidemiological link to a contaminated water source during an outbreak. The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by stool microscopy showing characteristic motile bacilli inhibited by specific antiserum and by positive stool culture for V. cholerae.\\nVitals: On admission, the patient was afebrile with a pulse rate of 110 bpm (low volume) and a blood pressure of 90/50 mmHg. After initial intravenous rehydration, her pulse rate improved to 84 bpm and her blood pressure rose to 100/70 mmHg.\\nContent: The patient developed profuse, large-volume watery diarrhoea, passing 12 to 15 stools in the past day. The stools were described as resembling diluted milk or rice water with white flakes. The illness was notable for the absence of abdominal pain or fever. Approximately one hour prior to presentation, she became unresponsive, prompting her husband to bring her to the hospital.\\n---\\n[EPIDEMIOLOGY]\\nContent: The  differential  diagnosis,  at  the  beginning  of  the  illness,  would include pathogenic enteric bacteria or viruses. However, as the illness progresses, the differential would include other intestinal protozoa, including Giardia lamblia .  A  rare  cause  of  illness  in  travelers, Cystoisospora  belli ,  can  produce  a  prolonged  diarrhea  after  travel,  and  is sensitive to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Fatigue and weight loss can be caused by Entamoeba histolytica , but anorexia is not as prominent. Dientamoeba fragilis can cause prolonged, low-grade intestinal symptoms, but without anorexia or weight loss. Fatigue and weight loss can be due to tropical sprue, which is a rare cause of prolonged diarrhea  in  travelers.  Celiac  sprue  occasionally  manifests  during foreign travel.\\n---\\n[SMALL BOWEL]\\nContent: A  wide  variety  of  disease  processes  give  rise  to  similar  histologic abnormalities in the mucosa of the small intestine, resulting in predictable  clinical  manifestations.  The  first  event  is  infiltration  of lymphocytes into the epithelium, resulting in an intraepithelial lymphocytosis. Next, there is increased crypt cell proliferation, resulting in  crypt  hyperplasia.  Then,  loss  of  villous  cells  leads  to  increasing degrees of villous atrophy, eventually leading to a flat mucosa. As a consequence of  mucosal malabsorption, patients present with diarrhea,  steatorrhea  and  weight  loss.  Laboratory  studies  may  be helpful in defining the extent of the malabsorption syndrome. Anemia may result from deficiencies of iron, folate and/or vitamin B12 - the latter implying that the mucosal damage extends to involve the terminal ileum. Prolongation of the prothrombin time may be due to a deficiency of vitamin K (one of the fat-soluble vitamins, along with A, D and E), which occurs in fat malabsorption. Hypophosphatemia, hypocalcemia  and  an  elevated  alkaline  phosphatase  are  seen  in vitamin D deficiency, which may cause osteomalacia or osteoporosis. Conditions that cause these histologic abnormalities and present with these  clinical  and  laboratory  features  include  parasitic  infections, celiac disease, tropical sprue, bacterial overgrowth and Crohn's disease (Box 3.4). Similar clinical manifestations may be seen in other disorders with specific pathologic findings, such as intestinal lymphoma and amyloidosis. The general principles of treating disorders of the small intestinal mucosa include treating the underlying disease and correcting any nutrient deficiencies that may be present. In addition, a lactose-free, low-fat diet may be beneficial.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

Lately, I've had these weird, itchy swellings on my arms and legs that pop up for a few days and then vanish, only to appear somewhere else later. But what really terrified me was this morning—I looked in the mirror and saw a small, worm-like thread actually moving across the white part of my eye! It didn't hurt, but it was horrifying. What is inside me?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[CUTANEOUS MYIASIS [3, 4]]\\nContent: Human bot flies,  also  known  as  ver  macaque,  berne,  el  torsalo  or beefworm ( Dermatobia  hominis Oestridae),  are  a  common  cause  of dermal myiasis in Central and South America. Their eggs are deposited on biting arthropods, such as mosquitoes, which carry them to the  skin  of  the  host.  Here,  the  eggs  hatch  and  the  larvae  burrow into the skin. As the  larva grows  over a period of 10 weeks, a boil develops with a small aperture. Larvae may grow to more than 1 cm\\nremoval of the larvae, debridement of affected tissue and treatment of secondary infection. Reconstructive surgery may be required.\\nOPHTHALMOMYIASIS (OCULAR\\nMYIASIS) [5, 61\\nin  length  (Fig.  136.3.1A,  B).  An  early  symptom  is  sporadic  pain caused by the spiny larva. Unless the eye is involved, infestation is generally  harmless.  Secondary  infection  of  the  wound  is  the  most common complication.\\nTumbu flies, also known as putsi fIy or ver du cayor ( Cordylobia anthropophaga Calliphoridae),  occur  throughout  sub-Saharan  Africa  and southern  Spain.  Females  lay  their  eggs,  usually  on  urine-  or  fecescontaminated sand or moist soil, and on clothes hung outside to dry. Skin contact with viable ova on clothing results in infestation. Larvae penetrate the skin and grow rapidly to mature in about 10 days. A painful inflamed boil develops which seems to wriggle, exudes bloodstained pus and has a definite head, through which the larval spiracles may  protrude  (Fig.  136.3.2).  There  may  be  associated  fever  and lymphadenopathy.\\nLarvae of warble flies ( Hypoderma spp.)  and  horse bot  flies, Gasterophilus spp.  (Oestridae),  can  invade  human  skin  causing  intense itching and a creeping eruption.\\n---\\n[OPHTHALMOMYIASIS <OCULAR MYIASIS= [5, 6]]\\nContent: Human victims  may  give  a  history  of  having  been  buzzed  in  the face or struck on the eye by an insect and later of developing irritation and  redness  of  the  eye,  foreign  body  sensation,  pain,  lacrimation, palpebral edema and signs of purulent conjunctivitis or a stye (hordeolum). Oestrus  ovis larvae  rarely  develop  beyond  the  first  instar  in humans and so symptoms are self-limiting, but they may be more rapidly relieved by slit lamp examination and removal of larvae which cling to the conjunctivae and may cause follicular conjunctival reaction and pseudomembrane formation. Other causes of human ophthalmomyiasis  include Rhinoestrus  purpureum,  Dermatobia  hominis, Hypoderma spp.,  (Oestridae),  and Cochlyomyia  hominis,  Lucilia spp. and Phormia spp. (Calliphoridae). Larvae of Hypoderma, Cochlyomyia and Dermatobia are more dangerous as they may burrow into the eye, resulting  in  pain,  nausea  and  destruction.  They  must  be  surgically removed.\\nCongo floor maggots, larvae  of the fly Auchmeromyia luteola live  in earthen  floors  of  huts  throughout  tropical  Africa  between  latitudes 18°N and 26°S. They suck blood from those sleeping on the ground, causing local swelling and itching.\\n---\\n[EYE WORM]\\nContent: Subconjunctival  migration  of  the  adult  eye  worm  (Fig.  1 1 1.4),  is generally accompanied by transient swelling of the lid and intense\\nFIGURE 111.5 Loa loa microfilaria in a thick blood smear of peripheral\\nFIGURE 111.4 Subconjunctival migration of an adult Loa loa worm.\\nFIGURE 111.5 Loa loa micro:laria  in  a  thick  blood  smear  of  peripheral blood  stained  with  Dela:eld's  hematoxylin  (180 × ),  showing  the  sheath (clear halo) and nuclei extending to the tip of the tail.

Although  most  episodes  resolve  spontaneously  and completely, rare cases of retinal artery occlusion and macular retinopathy  due  to  aberrant  migration  of  the  adult  parasite  have  been reported.\\n---\\n[SUBCUTANEOUS DIRO.LARIASIS]\\nContent: The most dramatic presentation of subcutaneous dirofilariasis is the presence of a moving adult worm in the conjunctiva (Fig. 1 13.6). This is often accompanied by swelling of the eyelid and face and a burning sensation. Occasionally, worms are found in the retina or within the eye and present as eye pain and blurred vision. Subcutaneous lesions in  other  parts  of  the  body  present  as  small  (0.5-1.5 cm),  painless nodules that develop over days to weeks. The nodule may or may not be  painful,  erythematous,  and  accompanied  by  a  feeling  of  movement. Systemic signs are unusual. The most common locations are the eyelid,  scrotum, breast,  arm,  and  leg,  although  any  part  of  the body can be involved.\\n---\\n[NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY]\\nContent: Adult nematodes coil in the stomach muscles of the definitive host. Eggs are passed in feces and, when exposed to water, release larvae. These larvae are ingested by freshwater copepods that are ingested, in turn,  by  an  intermediate  host,  where  larvae  invade  and  lodge  in muscle. Humans acquire the parasite by consuming the second- or third-stage larvae from infected intermediate hosts or paratenic hosts. In humans, larvae cannot develop into adult worms and will penetrate the stomach wall and migrate randomly within the human host. These larvae measure  2.5-12.5 mm. The incubation  period, or the time between ingestion of a worm and the first appearance of cutaneous manifestations, is usually from 3 to 4 weeks, although it can be as long as several years. Untreated, the worm can live in humans for several years; therefore, a long, asymptomatic interval can be followed by a sudden recurrence of symptoms [7].\\nInfection results in nonspecific symptoms, such as fever, mild malaise, urticaria,  and  epigastric  pain,  followed  by  external  (cutaneous)  or internal  (visceral)  larva  migrans.  The  migrating  worm  produces several toxins (acetylcholine, hyaluronidase, proteolytic enzyme, and hemolytic substance). The pathologic picture of swelling and tracklike necrosis demonstrates an intense cellular infiltration with neutrophils,  mononuclear  cells,  plasma  cells,  and  large  numbers  of eosinophils. Allergic changes are seen with hyper-eosinophilia. The parasite can migrate to the ocular system and central nervous system (CNS) causing localized inflammation and destruction.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

Now, he’s starting to get these large, tight blisters on his stomach and in his armpits. They look filled with fluid and don't pop easily. He hasn't changed his laundry detergent or anything, but he did start a new diabetes medication recently. What could be causing this sudden blistering?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Stevens-Johnson syndrome\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), a severe drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction. This clinical diagnosis is based on the patient's generalized maculopapular rash with extensive mucous membrane involvement (oral, conjunctival, genital), which appeared approximately four weeks after starting nevirapine and co-trimoxazole, both of which are highly implicated drugs. The diagnosis is further supported by the much higher incidence of SJS in HIV-positive individuals. Infectious causes like malaria were ruled out with negative testing.\\nVitals: Temperature is 37.7°C (99.9°F), blood pressure is 120/68 mmHg, pulse is 90 bpm, and respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute.\\nContent: The patient developed a productive cough with whitish sputum, followed one day later by a generalized skin rash that started on her trunk and spread to the extremities and mucosal membranes. Over the past two days, she also developed a sore throat and dysuria. The rash involves her lips, oral mucosa, conjunctivae, and genital mucosa, and has made talking and eating difficult and painful.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Onchocerciasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is onchocerciasis (river blindness), caused by the filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus. The diagnosis was established based on the highly typical clinical triad of chronic pruritic dermatitis, subcutaneous nodules over bony prominences, and characteristic corneal opacities (sclerosing keratitis). This is strongly supported by the patient's lifelong residency in an endemic region of Togo near a fast-flowing river, the known breeding site for the Simulium blackfly vector.\\nContent: The patient has noticed changes in both eyes over the past 4 years, without current visual disturbances, but he is worried because adults in his village have gone blind after similar changes. For the past two decades, he has developed multiple painless bumps under his skin. He also suffers from intense itching of his skin that is severe enough to keep him awake at night.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: African tick-bite fever\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is African tick-bite fever, caused by Rickettsia africae. This was a clinical diagnosis based on the patient's presentation with fever after travel to an endemic area in Southern Africa, and the pathognomonic finding of an inoculation eschar with regional lymphadenitis. The primary differential of malaria was ruled out with negative blood tests. The patient's rapid clinical improvement on doxycycline therapy further supported the diagnosis.\\nVitals: On presentation, after taking 1g of paracetamol, his tympanic temperature was 37.5 °C (99.5 °F), pulse was 80 bpm, and blood pressure was 130/70 mmHg.\\nContent: A 52-year-old man presented to a tropical medicine clinic with a two-day history of fever, night sweats, and a frontal headache. The symptoms began ten days after he returned from a trip to South Africa. He denied any joint pains and had not noticed a rash. He did report having a skin lesion on his left upper thigh which he had covered with a plaster.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Giardiasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is giardiasis, caused by the protozoan parasite Giardia intestinalis. This was confirmed by direct microscopic identification of Giardia trophozoites and cysts in stool samples. The clinical presentation of greasy, foul-smelling stools, bloating, and evidence of carbohydrate malabsorption (positive reducing substances in stool) is classic for this infection.\\nVitals: The patient has no fever; no other vital signs are reported.\\nContent: For the past two weeks, the patient has experienced four to five episodes of loose stools per day, accompanied by weight loss, anorexia, malaise, flatulence, and abdominal cramping during defecation. For the last three days, he has noted bloating and distension after consuming milk products. While he has mild nausea, he reports no fever. His stools were initially watery, but after a 5-day course of ciprofloxacin from a local pharmacy (which ended two days ago), they are now three to four per day and described as mushy, greasy, and foul-smelling.\\n---\\n[EDEMA]\\nContent: initial skin involvement may be mild, and patients often only come to clinical attention in the late stages of the disease when the central nervous system is involved. Dracunculiasis can also be associated with swelling and pain in an extremity, often the legs.

I smoke and have a family history of diabetes. Could this be more than just gingivitis?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[GENERAL ETIOLOGY]\\nContent: In general, the known causes for oral mucosal problems and tumors range from infectious agents - bacterial, viral and fungal infections - to trauma sustained over a long period as occurs in tobacco users either from smoke inhalation, heat from burning tobacco, or from specific components of the tobacco and any other substances with which  it  has  been  mixed.  The  effects  of  tobacco  use  appear  to  be exacerbated when combined with alcohol use. The cause of a number of invasive tumors, such as ameloblastomas, is not understood at the present time. Systemic diseases may also play a part in oral mucosal diseases.\\n---\\n[DENTAL CARIES]\\nContent: Dental caries is a chronic disease in which the composition of the oral flora is altered as a result of chronic consumption of high-sugar substances. This leads to demineralization of the enamel, eventually causing a dental cavity. Dental caries is a major oral health problem worldwide, and the incidence is increasing in developing countries as people  engage  in  Western  dietary  practices  [1 1].  Three  factors  are important in the prevention of caries: dietary counseling, oral hygiene, and fluoride supplementation.\\n---\\n[ORAL ULCERS]\\nContent: Lesions  of  the  mucosa  of  the  lips,  gums,  tongue,  floor  of  mouth, buccal cavity, palate and pharynx can be secondary to inflammatory, traumatic, neoplastic, metabolic, immunologic, hematologic and idiopathic causes. Different etiologies can be expressed in similar ways. For  instance,  infections,  malignancies,  autoimmune  disorders  and blood dyscrasias can all produce painful mouth ulcers. Oral disease caused by fungal, bacterial or viral infections can also be commonly found in immunocompromised hosts. For instance, oral lesions are strongly associated with HIV infection such as pseudomembranous oral candidiasis, oral hairy leukoplakia, HIV gingivitis and periodontitis,  Kaposi  sarcoma  and  non-Hodgkin  lymphoma.  All  mucosal ulcers  of  the  oral  cavity  that  do  not  heal  or  do  not  show  signs  of\\nhealing  within  2  weeks  warrant  further  investigation.  Microscopic examination of scrapings from the ulcer bed may demonstrate fungi such  as Candida  albicans .  Tissue  biopsies  are  required  to  assess  for malignant involvement.

Degenerative  conditions  can  occur everywhere, but disability is greatest when weight-bearing joints are involved. Degenerative disease of joints can be primary (idiopathic) or secondary to a vast array of conditions: congenital (developmental dysplasia  of  the  hip,  talipes  equinovarus),  hereditary  (osteogenesis imperfecta, achondroplasia), infectious (sequelae of septic arthritis), angular deformities (Blount\\'s disease) or avascular necrosis (sickle cell disease, Legg-Perthes disease). They can also be the result of trauma, particularly of intra-articular fractures that have been unrecognized or neglected.\\nThe rise of adult diabetes is associated with an increased incidence of neuropathic joints, particularly around the foot and ankle. Chronic low back pain (LBP) and significant osteoporosis are becoming more widespread  (Fig.  13.6).  Metastases  to  the  bone  secondary  to  neoplasms are also likely  to  increase.  Clinical,  radiographic,  and  basic laboratory  parameters  can  be  used  for  diagnosis.  Inflammatory\\nFIGURE 13.6 Thermal graph of emerging conditions.\\narthropathies  are  also  increasingly  recognized.  Symptomatic  treatment  is  with  aspirin,  analgesics,  early  generations  of  nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and corticosteroids.\\nBack pain is common worldwide. With greater than 80-90% of the workforce  in  the  developing  world  undertaking  strenuous  physical labor, one might suspect that the prevalence of low back pain would be increased over that seen in industrialized nations.

The diagnosis was strongly supported by the patients\\' travel history to the Chile-Argentinian border region, which is endemic for ANDV, their outdoor activities, and the clinical presentation of acute febrile illness with progressive respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, and in the wife\\'s case, multi-organ failure and hemorrhagic complications. Other respiratory viruses and many viral hemorrhagic fevers were ruled out by negative testing and incompatible incubation periods, leaving hantavirus as the most fitting explanation given the epidemiological context and clinical course.\\nVitals: For the husband on admission: BP 90/55 mmHg, pulse 120 beats per minute, oxygen saturation 94% on ambient air, and temperature 39°C (102.2°F). For the wife on admission (3 weeks after husband\\'s admission): normal blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen saturation, temperature 38.6°C (101.5°F).\\nContent: A 55-year-old Swiss couple, both fitness instructors, previously healthy and in their mid-50s, travelled for 3 months from Ecuador to Chile.\\n---\\n[CHIEF COMPLAINT]\\nDisease: Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy\\nDiagnosis Details: A presumed diagnosis of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) was made, likely as a form of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (PML-IRIS) given the onset after ART initiation. This diagnosis is supported by the clinical presentation of slowly progressive focal neurological deficits in a patient with advanced HIV (CD4 count 54/µL), and the characteristic MRI findings of multifocal, non-enhancing, T2 hyperintense white matter lesions without mass effect. The diagnosis was further supported by the lack of response to empirical therapy for toxoplasmosis and tuberculosis.\\nVitals: The patient was afebrile and her vital signs were reported as normal.\\nContent: Slowly progressive weakness of the left arm and leg over a duration of approximately 3 months.\\n---\\n[AGE3RELATED CONDITIONS]\\nContent: The morbidity associated with osteoporosis is secondary to fractures that occur in fragile low-density bone. Common fracture sites are the spine, hip and upper extremity. Spine and hip fractures are particularly debilitating. Vertebral compression fractures lead to deforming scoliosis  and  painful  nerve  root  compressions,  while  hip  fractures necessitate long periods of hospitalization and may be fatal in up to 20% of cases. Where there is dependence upon subsistence farming, a debilitating spine or hip fracture can be of severe detriment.\\nIncreasing age is a risk factor for the development of prostate, breast and lung cancers, each of which has a high propensity to metastasize to  bone. It  is  likely  that  there  will be an increase in the  burden  of secondary bone cancer. Slow development of many primary cancers, combined with lack of education and lack of access to chemotherapeutics  and  radiotherapy,  result  in  the  neglect  of  many  primary cancers. Disruption of the structural integrity of bone by cancerous lesions  reduces  the  load-bearing  capacity.  Pathologic  fractures  may result,  and should be suspected  in patients with nonspecific symptomatology  who  develop  a  fracture  with  a  mechanism  of  injury inconsistent with fracture severity.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.'},\n",

Because few long-time diabetics survive in the poor, rural communities of developing countries, diabetic retinopathy is less common than in developed countries and in increasingly affluent urban communities elsewhere. The major treatable component of the disease is the growth  of  neovascular  membranes  which  extend  into  the  vitreous from the  surface  of  the  optic  nerve  or  retina.  Timely  laser  therapy provides  substantial  benefit  and  dramatically  reduces  the  risk  of blindness. Laser treatment also benefits patients with fluid accumulation in the macula (macular edema) if they are treated early. Diabetics should have their eyes examined annually if possible to ensure that suitable laser treatment is applied prior to the development of sightthreatening complications.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT]\\nContent: - Initial white spot lesions : re-mineralize by coating the area with fluoridated toothpaste, varnish or gel repeatedly.\\n- Initial cavitation : small visible break in the surface enamel, in the enamel only, cover with fissure sealant.\\n- More extensive cavitation, but small :  clean  and  fill  with  glass ionomer cement, coat with fissure sealant.\\n- Cavitation  involving  outer  layer  of  dentine :  use  hand  instruments to remove undermined enamel; remove soft and decayed dentine; restore with glass ionomer cement.\\n- Cavitation with more extensive dentine involvement extending to  more than one surface of the tooth, but not entering the pulp cavity : refer for traditional restoration.\\n- Cavitation  with  pulpal  involvement :  treatment  of  choice  in resource-poor tropical  countries  is  tooth  extraction  under  local anesthesia.\\n- Management  of  infections  associated  with  pulpal  infections that  have  spread  to  surrounding  tissues :  spreading  infections from  periapical  abscesses  can  become  life-threatening.

Once the infection is under control, extract the tooth under local anesthesia.\\n---\\n[MANAGEMENT AND CLINICAL COURSE]\\nDisease: Buruli ulcer\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is Buruli ulcer, a necrotizing skin infection caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. The diagnosis was established based on the characteristic clinical presentation of progressive, indurated ulcers with undermined edges on the extremity of a child from an endemic region in West Africa. It was definitively confirmed by a positive PCR result for M. ulcerans from a wound swab. The paradoxical enlargement of one ulcer during therapy is a known phenomenon and not indicative of treatment failure.\\nVitals: On presentation, the patient had a pulse of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 100/70 mmHg, and a temperature of 37.9 °C (100.2 °F).\\nContent: Initial ineffective treatments included herbal remedies, diclofenac, dexamethasone, and oxacillin. After diagnosis, she received 8 weeks of specific antimycobacterial therapy along with adequate wound care using saline-soaked gauze and povidone-iodine. During treatment, the ulcer on the back of her hand healed almost completely, but the smaller ulcer paradoxically increased in size to 8x10 cm.

I looked inside his mouth with a flashlight and saw these little red bumps and blisters all over the back of his throat and on the roof of his mouth. He doesn't have a rash on his hands or feet. Is this strep throat?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Group A Streptococcus pharyngitis may be mild or associated with high fever,  tender  anterior  cervical  lymphadenopathy,  tonsillar  exudates and raised peripheral white cell count. Symptoms usually resolve after 3-5  days,  although  suppurative  complications  (which  are  now uncommon in industrialized settings) include peritonsillar and retropharyngeal  abscess,  suppurative  lymphadenitis,  otitis  media,  mastoiditis and  meningitis. Non-suppurative  complications  include scarlet fever, acute rheumatic fever or acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Scarlet fever is characterized by a diffuse blanching rash that spreads from the chest to the abdomen and extremities leaving a  sandpaper-like  texture  to  the  skin.  Desquamation  of  the  fingers, toes, groin and axilla occurs one or more weeks later. The tongue is frequently coated in a white film (white strawberry tongue) that eventually gives way to a beefy red appearance (red strawberry tongue). While most cases are benign, scarlet fever was often lethal in the preantibiotic era. Many cases likely represented what would be regarded today as streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS).\\nIn simple impetigo, infection is confined to the epidermis with the formation of superficial crusted lesions on the face or other exposed body  parts.  In  tropical  and  impoverished  settings  'pyodermatous' lesions may be pustular and ulcerative. Children are usually afebrile and otherwise well, although resolution of pyoderma may take many days and result in scarring. Erysipelas, which typically affects the face or  an  extremity,  is  a  painful  infection  of  the  dermis  resulting  in  a clearly  demarcated  red  and  raised  area  of  inflammation  and  often formation of superficial bullae. Cellulitis involves the deeper subcutaneous tissues  causing  a  more  diffuse  and  less  clearly  demarcated area of inflammation. Infection of the draining lymphatic tracts (lymphangitis) results in tender linear streaks extending from the site of infection. Unlike impetigo, cellulitis and erysipelas are usually associated with fever and systemic toxicity.\\n---\\n[PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS]\\nContent: Viruses  account  for  most  episodes  of  acute  pharyngitis  in  all  age groups. Group A Streptococcus is isolated in only 20-40% of cases of exudative pharyngitis in school-aged children and an even lower proportion  of  cases  in  younger  children  and  adults.  Recovery  of  the organism may not represent infection, but colonization. The distinguishing  features  of  Group  A Streptococcus pharyngitis  and  scarlet fever, and differential diagnoses, are detailed in Table 36-2.\\nStaphylococcus  aureus is  a  major  cause  of  community-acquired  pyogenic infection and an important differential diagnosis for invasive\\nGroup A Streptococcus infection, especially for skin and osteoarticular infections and necrotizing pneumonia. The features which may help to  distinguish  Group  A Streptococcus from S.  aureus and  other  skin infections are listed in Table 36-2. In addition, a form of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) may complicate S. aureus infection, and shares many features with STSS with the exception that it is more frequently associated with colonization rather than bacteremia or severe underlying infection.\\nInvasive infections resulting from trauma or bites, exposure to water or soil, or involving immunocompromised hosts (including diabetic foot infections) may be caused by a more expanded array of pathogens and therefore require broader empirical therapy and heightened efforts to obtain a microbiologic diagnosis [17].\\n---\\n[HAND-FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE]\\nContent: Hand-foot-and-mouth disease occurs most often in children under 10 years of age. The illness commences with fever ( > 38.5°C) and sore throat. The fever lasts 1-2 days during which time vesicles appear on the  anterior  buccal  and  gingival  mucous  membranes  and  tongue. Cutaneous vesicles occur most frequently on palms of the hands and soles  of  the  feet,  but  may  also  occur  on  the  buttocks  and  extensor surfaces of the elbows and knees. The skin lesions of hand-foot-andmouth disease are typically tender vesicles with a surrounding zone of erythema (Fig. 34.2.4).\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Stevens-Johnson syndrome\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), a severe drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction. This clinical diagnosis is based on the patient's generalized maculopapular rash with extensive mucous membrane involvement (oral, conjunctival, genital), which appeared approximately four weeks after starting nevirapine and co-trimoxazole, both of which are highly implicated drugs. The diagnosis is further supported by the much higher incidence of SJS in HIV-positive individuals. Infectious causes like malaria were ruled out with negative testing.\\nVitals: Temperature is 37.7°C (99.9°F), blood pressure is 120/68 mmHg, pulse is 90 bpm, and respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute.\\nContent: The patient developed a productive cough with whitish sputum, followed one day later by a generalized skin rash that started on her trunk and spread to the extremities and mucosal membranes. Over the past two days, she also developed a sore throat and dysuria. The rash involves her lips, oral mucosa, conjunctivae, and genital mucosa, and has made talking and eating difficult and painful.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Acute  rheumatic  fever  is  characterized  by  various  combinations  of fever, polyarthritis or arthralgias, carditis, characteristic rash (erythema marginatum), chorea and subcutaneous nodules [13] (Table 36-3). Chorea and insidious carditis can occur as a manifestation of acute rheumatic fever in the absence of other features. Severe or recurrent episodes of acute rheumatic fever may result in progressive damage to  the  mitral  valve  (and  sometimes  the  aortic  valve)  resulting  in incompetence and progressive heart failure (rheumatic heart disease). Over several years, the valve may eventually become stenotic. Acute post-streptococcal  glomerulonephritis  can  occur  1-2  weeks  after\\nthroat infection or a few weeks after Group A Streptococcus skin infection.  The  features  are  hematuria  (microscopic  or  gross),  edema (which may be most evident peri-orbitally) and hypertension. Severe cases can also be complicated by encephalopathy. The illness is generally benign in childhood, but there may be an appreciable mortality among adults as a result of renal and congestive cardiac failure. Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) is a term used to describe some children with tic or obsessive compulsive disorders in whom symptoms appear to develop or worsen following Group A Streptococcus infection. The existence of PANDAS is controversial [14]. Post-streptococcal reactive arthritis describes a syndrome of polyarthritis that differs from acute rheumatic fever by affecting a range of smaller joints, being relatively resistant  to  anti-inflammatory  treatment  and  not  being  associated with carditis, although cases of acute rheumatic fever have been misdiagnosed as post-streptococcal reactive arthritis [15, 16].\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

There is no history of trauma.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Amoebic liver abscess\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is an amoebic liver abscess, caused by Entamoeba histolytica. This is supported by the clinical triad of fever and tender hepatomegaly with right intercostal tenderness, imaging findings of a large solitary liver lesion with an elevated hemidiaphragm, and the aspiration of characteristic 'brownish pus'. The diagnosis was further confirmed by the patient's rapid clinical response to metronidazole therapy and the relevant epidemiological risk factor of consuming locally brewed alcohol known to be associated with amoebiasis.\\nVitals: On examination, the patient's temperature was 38.3 °C (100.8 °F), blood pressure was 100/80 mmHg, pulse was 102 bpm, and respiratory rate was 24 breath cycles per minute.\\nContent: For the past week, the patient experienced fever, chills, headache, and body aches, along with severe right-hypochondrial pain.

This was established based on the clinical signs of cardiac tamponade (hypotension, tachycardia, pulsus paradoxus, elevated JVP), radiographic evidence of a large pericardial effusion ('globular heart'), and the patient's HIV-positive status in a tuberculosis-endemic region. The diagnosis was functionally confirmed by the dramatic clinical improvement following pericardiocentesis and the successful outcome after initiating antituberculous and antiretroviral therapy.\\nVitals: The patient's pulse was regular at 130 bpm with a pronounced pulsus paradoxus of 15 mmHg. His blood pressure in the supine position was 90/60 mmHg. He was noted to be slightly breathless in the supine position.\\nContent: The patient was well until one month prior to presentation when he began experiencing a feeling of fullness in his upper abdomen.

He more recently began to feel breathless on lying down and faint upon standing up.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Urogenital schistosomiasis\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was urogenital schistosomiasis caused by Schistosoma haematobium, leading to obstructive uropathy and end-stage renal disease. The diagnosis was made endoscopically based on the characteristic cystoscopy findings of a hyperaemic mucosa with multiple ‘sandy patches.’ This was supported by the patient's severe renal failure, bilateral hydronephrosis on ultrasound, and a highly compatible epidemiological risk as a fisherman in Lake Malawi. His death was due to complications, likely bacterial peritonitis related to his peritoneal dialysis.\\nVitals: On admission, his blood pressure was 200/130 mmHg, pulse was 66 bpm, temperature was 36.8° C, and the respiratory rate was 32 breaths per minute.\\nContent: The patient presented with a 5-day history of progressive shortness of breath, orthopnoea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. He also developed continuous, dull bilateral flank pain and constant nausea over the past few days. He reported no cough and no fever.\\n---\\n[PROCTITIS]\\nContent: Inflammation  of  the  rectum  causes  rectal  pain,  tenesmus  and  a mucopurulent rectal discharge. While any of the infectious causes of colitis may involve the rectum, isolated proctitis is more commonly a sexually transmitted infection (STI), usually seen in men who have sex  with  men  who  engage  in  unprotected  anal  intercourse  [20]. Common causes are gonorrhea, herpes simplex, lymphogranuloma venereum secondary to chlamydia (which is endemic in Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and Central and South America), and syphilis. Noninfectious  causes  of  proctitis  include  the  inflammatory  bowel diseases, radiation, ischemia and neoplasia. Infectious workup should include rectal swab cultures for  gonorrhea,  lymphogranuloma venereum and herpes simplex virus, and blood for syphilis serologic testing. STI testing should be performed prior to rectal examination, as some lubricants are bacteriostatic. Anoscopy may not be possible due to pain; if performed, the mucosa is seen to be edematous, erythematous and friable with exudates or ulceration. If the proctitis is likely  due  to  an  STI  but  the  causative  agent  is  unknown,  empiric antimicrobial therapy should be started; the combination of ceftriaxone,  doxycycline  and  valacyclovir is  effective against  the  four main causes. Sexual partners should be identified and treated; counseling regarding barrier protection is important, as proctitis increases the risk of HIV transmission.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",

These patients may present with marked systemic symptoms, and can suffer severe morbidity from lack of epidermal barrier function, including dehydration,  infection  and  severe  pain.  Ectropion  may  be  seen. Diffuse erythema can lead to severe imbalances of electrolytes and minerals,  and  hypocalcemic  tetany  can  occur.  As  the  eruption improves,  generalized  exfoliation  is  the  norm.  The  evaluation  of patients with erythroderma often requires histopathologic evaluation, to exclude full-thickness epidermal necrosis, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). TEN is commonly caused by a drug, but infectious etiologies have also been implicated, particularly mycoplasma and herpetic infections.\\nErythroderma may be caused by severe drug reactions. The presence of small, superficial pustules may indicate exanthematous generalized pustular dermatosis (AGEP), most commonly caused by β -lactam and cephalosporin antibiotics. Patients  present with fever and can have peripheral blood leukocytosis, commonly prompting evaluation for an  infectious  disease.  A  similar  finding  may  be  noted  in  pustular psoriasis, which may occur in patients with no prior history of psoriasis.

Infectious etiologies and rare causes of hyperthermia need to be ruled out. The differential diagnosis should include malignant hyperthermia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, endocrine and hypothalamic disorders, and fictitious hyperthermia. Heat edema and heat syncope are suggested by advanced patient age, deconditioning, low cardiac reserve and recent arrival in the tropics from cooler regions. Miliaria, a distinct heat dermatosis, is differentiated from other tropical skin maladies  by  the  timing,  distribution  and  physical  appearance  of  skin vesicles.  Miliaria  responds  promptly  to  antihistamines  or  dilute topical chlorhexidine. Heat cramps are a second common malady in unacclimatized individuals;  diagnosis  is  suggested  by  resolution  of cramps with rest and cool treatment, stretching and fluids, and electrolyte  repletion.  The  two  most  dangerous  heat  illnesses  -  heat exhaustion and heat stroke - have overlapping clinical features and are discussed in greater detail below.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Stevens-Johnson syndrome\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis is Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), a severe drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction. This clinical diagnosis is based on the patient's generalized maculopapular rash with extensive mucous membrane involvement (oral, conjunctival, genital), which appeared approximately four weeks after starting nevirapine and co-trimoxazole, both of which are highly implicated drugs. The diagnosis is further supported by the much higher incidence of SJS in HIV-positive individuals. Infectious causes like malaria were ruled out with negative testing.\\nVitals: Temperature is 37.7°C (99.9°F), blood pressure is 120/68 mmHg, pulse is 90 bpm, and respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute.\\nContent: The patient developed a productive cough with whitish sputum, followed one day later by a generalized skin rash that started on her trunk and spread to the extremities and mucosal membranes. Over the past two days, she also developed a sore throat and dysuria. The rash involves her lips, oral mucosa, conjunctivae, and genital mucosa, and has made talking and eating difficult and painful.\\n---\\n[PATHOPHYSIOLOGY]\\nContent: Heat illnesses are the result of excessive heat loads from the environment, the body's inability to dissipate heat or a combination of the two. In healthy individuals, the body compensates for heat stress by thermoregulatory  processes  and,  less  effectively,  through  adaptive processes. As total body heat load rises, a sensitive thermoregulatory system responds by stimulating the pre-optic nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus, which causes the dilation of cutaneous blood vessels and an increase in sweat production [1 1]. Familiarity with the mechanisms  of  heat  loss  allows  the  clinician  to  diagnose  impaired  thermoregulation and select the optimum cooling strategy for different patients and different treatment settings. There are four primary strategies that humans use to dissipate heat to the surrounding environment:  evaporation,  radiation,  convection  and  conduction.  Care providers  who  understand  these  mechanisms  of  heat  loss  are  well positioned to exploit these mechanisms to greater effect using focal cold  therapy.  The  major  form  of  heat  loss  in  hot,  dry  climates  is evaporation of sweat  or surface water from the skin or pulmonary system. Each of the four physical methods of heat loss is enhanced by compensatory physiologic processes such as increased sweat production, respiration and cardiac output, alterations in cutaneous and splanchnic blood flow, and reduction in physical activity. The physical mechanisms of heat loss are summarized in Table 24-2.\\nPhysiologic thermoregulation expands upon physical mechanisms of heat loss through a combination of cutaneous vasodilation, increased sweat-based and  respiratory evaporative cooling, and  increased cardiac output. Environmental conditions greatly influence the efficiency of thermoregulation. For example, large temperature gradients between the body and surrounding air, convective loss from increased air movement, and low humidity all favor efficient cooling. Evaporative heat loss is limited by humidity greater than 75% and by impaired physiologic  responses  such  as  anhidrosis,  perfusion  abnormalities, low cardiac output and the effect of certain medications or ingested\\n---\\n[PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS]\\nContent: if sexually active.

I have a fever, I’m wheezing constantly, and I’m coughing up thick, brownish plugs of mucus. My rescue inhaler doesn't seem to help. Is this just a severe asthma attack or something else?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[REACTIVE AIRWAYS DISEASE (RAD OR ASTHMA)]\\nContent: This is reversible lower airway obstruction, associated with history of cough (particularly at night), with or without wheezing on auscultation (long, musical, high-pitched whistling sound on expiration originating in the bronchioles) and can be differentiated from crepitations (short crackling sounds on inspiration associated with pneumonia) in the alveoli by both the quality of the sound and particularly by the timing in the respiratory cycle. RAD may follow, or accompany, a viral infection, but often persists after the viral infection has resolved, and may be triggered by other causes (e.g. indoor air pollution). Fever is often not present. Cough, particularly night-time coughing may be the primary sign. This may be diagnosed by a beta-agonist challenge, such as with an albuterol nebulizer and is appreciated by a decrease in respiratory rate (by ≥ 5 breaths/minute) and effort, and improved oxygen saturation.\\n---\\n[BRONCHIOLITIS]\\nContent: This is a distinct syndrome of infants and young children. The major symptom is wheezing, accompanied by flaring of the nostrils, use of accessory  respiratory  muscles  and  cyanosis  in  more  severe  cases. Direct viral infection of the bronchiolar epithelial cells, followed by necrosis, infiltration of lymphocytes, submucosal  swelling  and increased mucus secretion results in the formation of dense plugs of debris that cause impediment of airflow, particularly expiratory. Children  may  experience  repeated  episodes  of  wheezing  after  recovery from  bronchiolitis.  Associations  with  later  development  of  asthma and a causative role of the immune system in pathogenesis of bronchiolitis have been suggested.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES [31]]\\nContent: Some patients have symptoms suggesting histamine toxicity: vasodilatation, hypotension, vomiting, diarrhea, throbbing headache, coma and bronchoconstriction. In Latin America, victims of attacks by A. m.  scutellata have  shown  evidence  of  generalized  rhabdomyolysis (grossly elevated  serum creatine kinase, aminotransferases  and myoglobin), intravascular hemolysis, hypercatecholaminemia (hypertension,  pulmonary  edema  with  hyaline  membrane,  myocardial damage), bleeding, hepatic dysfunction and acute renal failure. Mass vespid attacks can result in hepatic damage. In non-sensitized people, stings from Solenopsis and Myrmecia spp. produce pain, itching, swelling and erythema around a central weal which last a few hours, and later  vesicles  or  pustules.  In  an  un-sensitized  patient,  an  estimated 10,000 Solenopsis invicta stings caused no systemic envenoming.

This was definitively confirmed by the microscopic demonstration of 5 to 10 trypanosomes per high power field on a thick blood film. The diagnosis is supported by the epidemiological link to a national game park in Malawi with tsetse fly exposure, and the clinical signs of fever, rash, and a trypanosomal chancre. The normal CSF confirmed the disease was in the first stage, without neurological involvement.\\nVitals: On presentation, his vital signs were: temperature 38 °C, pulse rate 130 bpm, and systolic blood pressure 60 mmHg. He later developed a sustained fever of 38 to 39 °C during his hospital stay.\\nContent: A 42-year-old British male expatriate who has lived in Malawi for 18 months. He has a family history of allergy. He had previously kept bees in the United Kingdom and been stung frequently without ill effect. However, 9 months prior to this presentation, he was bitten by insects at Lake Malawi and developed a self-resolving asthmatic attack over two days.\\n---\\n[INHALATIONAL ANTHRAX]\\nContent: Inhalational anthrax accounts for < 5% of reported cases. Nonspecific symptoms of mild fever, malaise, fatigue, and myalgia develop 1-5 days after exposure; nonproductive cough is often reported. In cases occurring in the 2001 epidemic, nausea or vomiting was common [6] and some had extreme fatigue and severe headache. Patients may have transient  improvement  after  several  days  or  may  directly  develop severe respiratory distress with cyanosis, diaphoresis, increased fever, and  tachycardia.  Stridor,  diffuse  rales,  and  basilar  dullness  may  be heard. Chest radiographs reveal symmetric, characteristic mediastinal widening, pleural effusions and, in some cases, patchy infiltrates (Fig. 60.3).  Massive,  superficial edema of the head and neck may occur. Meningitis, often hemorrhagic, occurs in ~50% of cases. Pleural effusions may also be hemorrhagic.

This is a clinical diagnosis based on the rapid progression of a destructive facial lesion in a chronically malnourished, unimmunized child from a resource-poor setting with a recent history suggestive of measles. The diagnosis is supported by the exclusion of other conditions like syphilis, yaws, or rapidly progressing leishmaniasis based on epidemiology and clinical presentation. There are no specific laboratory tests to confirm noma.\\nContent: Three days ago, the family noticed a dark sore on the child's cheek. The lesion progressed quickly to eat through the child's cheek. Associated symptoms include bad breath, poor oral intake, and listlessness.\\n---\\n[DEEP FASCIAL SPACE INFECTIONS]\\nContent: The deep fascial  spaces of  the head and neck are  potential cavities and can be involved in infections that extend from adjacent structures such  as  the  teeth,  tonsils,  lymph  nodes,  salivary  glands  and  soft tissues. Involvement and abscess formation and edema can result in obstruction  (swallowing  and  breathing),  pain,  tenderness,  trismus and neck stiffness. Visible soft tissue swelling can result from infections  of  the  peritonsillar,  parapharyngeal,  parotid,  submandibular, suprahyoid, periauricular and masseteric spaces. Peritonsillar abscess formation, also known as Quinsy, presents with unilateral swelling of  the  soft  palate  above  the  tonsil.  Abscess  formation  beneath  the floor of the mouth, called Ludwig's angina, produces tense and tender swelling behind the chin and between the angles of the jaw. Vincent's angina, or trench mouth, presents with localized or multiple necrotic mucosal  ulcerations  and  foul  breath.  Retropharyngeal  and  retroesophageal abscesses produce dysphagia and neck rigidity. Mediastinal spread is a potential complication that can lead to sepsis; rupture may lead to respiratory obstruction.  Erosion of the  great vessels of the neck can lead to catastrophic hemorrhage. Soft tissue lateral views of  the  head  and  neck  may  aid  in  diagnosing  retropharyngeal  and retroesophageal abscesses. Purulent material that is drained or aspirated from deep neck abscesses should be submitted for culture and sensitivity studies and the results used to adjust the selection of antibiotics. Treatment  should include aggressive antibiotic therapy against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms (including anaerobes), prompt incision and drainage of abscesses, and adequate nutrition and fluid therapy. Respiratory obstruction should be proactively addressed with consideration of artificial airways.\\n---\\n[CLINICAL FEATURES]\\nContent: Group A Streptococcus pharyngitis may be mild or associated with high fever,  tender  anterior  cervical  lymphadenopathy,  tonsillar  exudates and raised peripheral white cell count. Symptoms usually resolve after 3-5  days,  although  suppurative  complications  (which  are  now uncommon in industrialized settings) include peritonsillar and retropharyngeal  abscess,  suppurative  lymphadenitis,  otitis  media,  mastoiditis and  meningitis. Non-suppurative  complications  include scarlet fever, acute rheumatic fever or acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Scarlet fever is characterized by a diffuse blanching rash that spreads from the chest to the abdomen and extremities leaving a  sandpaper-like  texture  to  the  skin.  Desquamation  of  the  fingers, toes, groin and axilla occurs one or more weeks later. The tongue is frequently coated in a white film (white strawberry tongue) that eventually gives way to a beefy red appearance (red strawberry tongue). While most cases are benign, scarlet fever was often lethal in the preantibiotic era. Many cases likely represented what would be regarded today as streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS).\\nIn simple impetigo, infection is confined to the epidermis with the formation of superficial crusted lesions on the face or other exposed body  parts.  In  tropical  and  impoverished  settings  'pyodermatous' lesions may be pustular and ulcerative. Children are usually afebrile and otherwise well, although resolution of pyoderma may take many days and result in scarring. Erysipelas, which typically affects the face or  an  extremity,  is  a  painful  infection  of  the  dermis  resulting  in  a clearly  demarcated  red  and  raised  area  of  inflammation  and  often formation of superficial bullae. Cellulitis involves the deeper subcutaneous tissues  causing  a  more  diffuse  and  less  clearly  demarcated area of inflammation. Infection of the draining lymphatic tracts (lymphangitis) results in tender linear streaks extending from the site of infection. Unlike impetigo, cellulitis and erysipelas are usually associated with fever and systemic toxicity.\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Tuberculous Lymphadenitis with Paradoxical IRIS\\nDiagnosis Details: The final diagnosis was tuberculous lymphadenitis with superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis, complicated by paradoxical immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). The initial diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis was confirmed by an AFB-positive fine-needle aspirate from a neck gland. The paradoxical IRIS was diagnosed clinically based on his worsening condition after starting ART, despite evidence of a good virologic and immunologic response. The superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis, likely with Staphylococcus aureus, was confirmed by the second aspirate showing purulent material with coccoid bacteria and the patient's rapid improvement following incision, drainage, and antibiotics.\\nVitals: On presentation, he was febrile with a temperature of 39.2 °C (102.56° F). His pulse was 112 bpm, respiratory rate was 28 breaths per minute, and he had a normal blood pressure.\\nContent: For six weeks, the patient has experienced a productive cough and chest pain, associated with systemic symptoms including weight loss, fevers, and night sweats.

Environmental conditions greatly influence the efficiency of thermoregulation. For example, large temperature gradients between the body and surrounding air, convective loss from increased air movement, and low humidity all favor efficient cooling. Evaporative heat loss is limited by humidity greater than 75% and by impaired physiologic  responses  such  as  anhidrosis,  perfusion  abnormalities, low cardiac output and the effect of certain medications or ingested\\n---\\n[MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOMES]\\nContent: Treatment  of  heat  illness  is  provided  in  Table  24-5.  Management strategies exploit all four principal mechanisms of heat loss and cold therapy targeted to specific body locations (see Fig. 24.1). Minor heat illnesses  are  self-limiting  if  the  patient  is  provided  with  fluids,  rest and access to a cool environment. The majority of cases require only fluids  and  electrolytes  for  resolution  of  symptoms.  Heat  edema  is prevented by exercise programs prior to travel to the tropics, optimization of diuretics and beta-blockers, and use of supportive compressive stockings.\\nHeat exhaustion is a more serious form of hyperthermia that requires close evaluation. Initial treatment of patients includes documentation of core temperature, assessment of blood chemistries, and treatment using  hydration,  moisture  to  the  skin-preferably  with  convective cooling and oral electrolyte solutions. If symptoms are more severe or mental status changes are noted, the patient should be treated with intravenous normal saline. Both normal and abnormal serum chemistries  should  be  rechecked  after  hydration  and  urine  output  is restored. Patients should be monitored until core body temperature has  normalized.  Heat  exhaustion  patients  who  have  persistent  or worsening  mental  status  changes  should  have  core  temperature rechecked to confirm the diagnosis, and should receive more aggressive and prolonged cold treatment.\\nThe  treatment  for  heat  stroke  requires  prompt,  aggressive  physical cooling.  All  measures  for  dissipating  heat  should  be  maximized: evaporation,  radiation,  convection  and  conductive  cooling.  Treatment of heat stroke in the tropics may be limited by inadequate water for  cooling  baths,  unavailability  of  air-conditioning  and  unreliable electricity to power fans. Patient monitoring during treatment may be\\nFIGURE 24.1 Thermoregulation and therapeutic cooling.\\ncomplicated by lack of quality thermometers or supportive laboratory tests.  One  frequently  overlooked  issue  is  that  the  conditions  that caused one heat casualty are very likely to cause a large number of casualties. Initial assessment of a solitary heat illness casualty should therefore consider how local medical resources may efficiently scale to treat a large number of patients.\\n---\\n[EPIDEMIOLOGY]\\nContent: Heat  illness  is  common  among  athletes,  soldiers,  foundry  workers and in the general population during mass gatherings in hot environments such as the annual Hajj pilgrimage [2, 3]. Among young athletes, the most severe form of heat illness - heat stroke - is the second leading  cause  of  death  [4].  In  tropical  regions,  heat  casualties  are common and may be increasing in developing economies as more workers are required to work under sweltering conditions. In many settings, inadequate access to cool havens or to cold, potable water increase the risk of heat illness. Epidemiologic studies on heat illness conducted in the USA and Europe [5, 6]indicate the groups at highest risk of heat illness are children under four years of age, the elderly, those with renal and endocrine disorders, and institutionalized and hospitalized patients [7, 8]. In particular, the  importance of sweatbased evaporative cooling is demonstrated by the higher incidence of heat  illness  in  the  elderly  and  in  patients  being  treated  with  anticholinergic medication [9, 10]. At this time, there are no convincing studies  demonstrating  differences  in  risk  of  heat  illness  between genders. Acclimatization to heat can reduce the risk of heat illness. Acclimatization involves near- and long-term physiologic adaptation; key  findings  include:  rapid  correction  of  water  loss  and  improved sodium preservation and gradual normalization of plasma electrolytes, altered blood perfusion to the skin, and reduced sodium concentrations in sweat and urine. New arrivals to tropical climes undergo limited acclimatization over a 2-4-week period; subsequent advances in acclimatization are both limited and not definitively proven by the current literature.\\n---\\n[MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOMES]\\nContent: body  core  temperature  at  twice  the  rate  of  convective  mist-water cooling  (mist  water  and  electric  fan).  The  advantage  of  cold  water baths is  that  the rate of cooling can be controlled by changing the water temperature or the amount of body surface area in the water. In immersion cooling, the patient is undressed and placed in a tub of suitable depth to allow water to cover the extremities; cold immersion should only be used on alert patients. Heat stroke patients and those with comorbidities, such as underlying cardiac disease, should be monitored for arrhythmias or syncope and, if the situation is not critical, cooled using less aggressive methods. In developed regions, immersion cooling has fallen out of favor because of difficulties with patient telemetry.  In  refugee camps, however,  a  water bath is often constantly in use to treat heat illnesses.\\n---\\n[DIAGNOSIS]\\nContent: The  differential  diagnosis  of  heat  illness  requires  a  history  of  heat exposure,  a  detailed  physical  exam  and  bedside  studies.  Infectious etiologies and rare causes of hyperthermia need to be ruled out. The differential diagnosis should include malignant hyperthermia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, endocrine and hypothalamic disorders, and fictitious hyperthermia. Heat edema and heat syncope are suggested by advanced patient age, deconditioning, low cardiac reserve and recent arrival in the tropics from cooler regions. Miliaria, a distinct heat dermatosis, is differentiated from other tropical skin maladies  by  the  timing,  distribution  and  physical  appearance  of  skin vesicles.

       "    'content': \"PATIENT QUESTION:\\nI’ve had these dry, red, itchy patches on my buttocks and lower back for almost five years now. My doctor keeps saying it’s just eczema or psoriasis, but the steroid creams never really make it go away. Recently, some of the flat red spots have started to feel thicker and raised, almost like hard plaques. I’m a 55-year-old man. Could this be something other than just dry skin?\\n\\nRETRIEVED REFERENCE CASES (from medical database):\\n[ERYTHRODERMA]\\nContent: Pityriasis rubra pilaris, a close relative of psoriasis, may also be the cause of erythroderma. Patients often have conspicuous 'islands of sparing', where seemingly normal skin is noted among erythrodermic skin. Hyperlinearity may be seen in palms and soles, in addition to a salmon-colored, sand-papered type of scale with sharp demarcation along transgrediens lines (the line boundary between cutaneous skin and the sole of the foot, for instance).\\nOther important diagnoses to consider include atopic dermatitis, viral exanthems, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, which in the leukemic phase is termed Sé zary syndrome, the staphylococcal skin scalded syndrome, as well as toxic shock syndrome. In HIV-positive individuals or those with other immunosuppressing disorders, seborrheic dermatitis may lead to erythroderma. Uncommonly, systemic malignancies such as colon and lung carcinoma, as well as lymphoma and leukemia, can also be culprits. In those who have had a bone marrow transplant, erythroderma may be a result of graft-versus-host disease. Red man syndrome indicates a state of erythroderma where no clear culprit can be ascertained.\\n---\\n[SKIN DISEASE]\\nContent: CPOD consists  of  flat-topped  papules  that  vary  in  size  and  height above the skin surface (Fig. 1 12.6B). Some lesions can  be macular. Itching can occur, and individuals with CPOD may also have acute lesions. LOD or 'sowda' typically affects young adults and is characterized by pruritic, hyperpigmented and hyperkeratotic plaques (Fig. 112.6C). The distribution is asymmetric, involving one limb, and is associated with regional lymphadenopathy. In later stages, the skin can be grossly lichenified. Itching is intense in the acute stage; this condition can coexist with APOD or CPOD. Atrophy of the skin is relatively common in areas of high endemicity (Fig. 1 12.6D). Atrophic skin adopts many of the characteristics of aging, such as loss of elasticity, and the skin appears excessively wrinkled. Hairs may be lost and sweating reduced. Onchocercal depigmentation or 'leopard skin' is associated with patches of complete pigment loss and generally affects the lower leg anteriorly (Fig. 1 12.6E). A rare manifestation is 'hanging groin'  or  'adenolymphocele'  that  is  observed  only  in  heavy  and longstanding infections, and consists of a pouch of lymphedematous tissue in which hang atrophic inguinal or femoral nodes (Fig. 1 12.6F). Inflammatory damage to the lymph nodes and lymphatics may, over the long term, lead to elephantiasis of the limbs or genitalia.\\n---\\n[ERYTHRODERMA]\\nContent: Correctly  diagnosing  the  cause  of  diffuse  erythroderma  or  wholebody erythema presents a unique challenge to the physician. These patients may present with marked systemic symptoms, and can suffer severe morbidity from lack of epidermal barrier function, including dehydration,  infection  and  severe  pain.  Ectropion  may  be  seen. Diffuse erythema can lead to severe imbalances of electrolytes and minerals,  and  hypocalcemic  tetany  can  occur.  As  the  eruption improves,  generalized  exfoliation  is  the  norm.  The  evaluation  of patients with erythroderma often requires histopathologic evaluation, to exclude full-thickness epidermal necrosis, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). TEN is commonly caused by a drug, but infectious etiologies have also been implicated, particularly mycoplasma and herpetic infections.\\nErythroderma may be caused by severe drug reactions. The presence of small, superficial pustules may indicate exanthematous generalized pustular dermatosis (AGEP), most commonly caused by β -lactam and cephalosporin antibiotics. Patients  present with fever and can have peripheral blood leukocytosis, commonly prompting evaluation for an  infectious  disease.  A  similar  finding  may  be  noted  in  pustular psoriasis, which may occur in patients with no prior history of psoriasis. Though nail findings may be helpful in those with prior history, such findings may not be seen in those with an acute, first episode. Patients appear ill and are often hospitalized. Cultures of the pustules\\nFIGURE 8.6 Ichthyosis. Note the Cne white scales in the lower extremities.\\nfail to indicate a superficial cutaneous infection, though ectopic infection  such  as  streptococcal  pharyngitis  may  precipitate  an  attack. Though  oral  steroids  may  improve  symptoms,  upon  withdrawal, disease can re-flare.\\n---\\n[DERMATOLOGIC DISEASE]\\nContent: Scabies can present with pruritic papular lesions similar to those seen with PPE; however, scabies lesions tend to be clustered in the finger webs, waist, ankles, axillae, breasts, and genital areas, and burrows can sometimes be seen. Severe scabies ('Norwegian' scabies) can present with a crusted thick grayish scale teeming with mites. Scratching of scabies lesions can lead to bacterial superinfection. Oral ivermectin or  topical  agents  are  effective.  Prurigo  nodularis-a  condition  that results from intense scratching-presents with larger ( > 1 cm) pruritic nodules that often start on the extremities with a symmetric distribution; management should identify the underlying cause of pruritis. Topical steroids, topical capsaicin, and oral antihistamines can ameliorate symptoms.\\nSeborrheic dermatitis presents with dandruff and indistinct plaques of  yellowish  scale  involving  the  scalp,  face,  chest,  back,  and  groin. Although it can typically be seen on the hair-bearing area of the head (e.g. eyebrows, outer ear canal), in the context of HIV infection, and especially in Africa, it occurs at skin folds (e.g. axillae, inner thighs). Mild  cases  respond  to  dandruff  shampoo  (e.g.  selenium sulfide or zinc pyrithione).  More severe cases require  topical  antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole) directed against Pityrosporum yeasts such as Malassezia furfur and steroids. Refractory cases may require oral ketoconazole.\\nPhotodermatitis  frequently  occurs  in  Africa  and  presents  with  an itchy, scaly rash. It is differentiated from seborrheic dermatitis by its distribution  on  sun-exposed  areas  of  skin.  Although  sulfonamides can be photosensitizing, their use in treating HIV infection is important  and  they  should  not  be  stopped,  if  possible,  because  of photodermatitis.\\n---\\n[PRURITUS AND PAPULES]\\nContent: cream, sulfur, malathion and ivermectin lotion. Crusted or nodular scabies and disease in the immunosuppressed often require systemic ivermectin at 200 mcg/kg. The entire family, including pets, should be treated, and clothes, bedding, and frequently used fomites should be immediately  washed  in  warm  water.  A  second  treatment  a  week  after  is usually recommended. Oral antipruritics may be needed.\\nPrurigo nodularis manifests as hyperkeratotic nodules, linear excoriations and lichenification, particularly over areas that the patient can reach.  In  this  condition,  patients  may  experience  diffuse  or  focal pruritus.  Rather  than  scratching,  patients  tend  to  'pick',  creating 'picker  nodules' .  Therapy  is  with  topical  or  injectable  steroids  or phototherapy. Nodules may also raise concern for scabies, particularly in  the  patient  with  severe  pruritus.  It  is  important  to  consider  the diagnosis  of  papular  eruption  of  HIV,  where  patients  develop  erythematous papules with urticarial-type erythema. Chronic cases may resemble  prurigo  nodularis.  Recent  reports  have  shown  that  the\\nFIGURE 8.4 Scabies. Scabies incognito in which an elderly patient with a neuropathy had a nonspeciCc, asymptomatic hand 'rash' that proved to be due to crusted scabies.\\npathology  of  these  lesions  may  mimic  insect  bites.  Interestingly, symptoms as well as response to therapy may correspond with the CD4 count in HIV-infected individuals. Finally, when these papules show a necrotic center, the patient is less pruritic, and the diagnosis of  papulonecrotic  tuberculosis  needs  to  be  considered.  Acne-like nodules and papules in a sun-exposed distribution should raise suspicion  for  eosinophilic  folliculitis  which  may  manifest  during  the immune reconstitution syndrome, but may also suggest viral resistance, worsening CD4 counts, or untreated infection altogether.\\n\\nDiagnose based on patient symptoms FIRST, use references to validate.\"},\n",
