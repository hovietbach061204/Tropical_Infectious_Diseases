    "[EXPOSURE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY]\\nDisease: Enteric Fever\\nFinal Diagnosis: Suspected enteric infection related to Salmonella species\\nVitals: Not documented\\nContent: Enteric fever remains endemic in parts of South and Southeast Asia, particularly in areas with limited access to clean water and sanitation. Infection commonly follows ingestion of food or drinking water contaminated with human feces. Travelers or residents in rural or peri-urban settings are at increased risk, especially during warmer months when bacterial proliferation in water supplies is more likely. Person-to-person transmission can occur in households with poor hand hygiene.\\n\\n[Clinical Features]\\nContent: Patients with prolonged febrile illnesses in tropical regions may develop nonspecific gastrointestinal complaints. Alternating constipation and diarrhea can occur in systemic infections affecting the intestinal lymphoid tissue. Marked fatigue, abdominal discomfort, and anorexia are common, and fever often shows a stepwise daily increase rather than abrupt spikes. These features overlap with other causes of undifferentiated tropical fever, making clinical diagnosis challenging.\\n\\n[SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS]\\nDisease: Typhoid Fever\\nFinal Diagnosis: Typhoid fever caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi\\nVitals: Temperature up to 39.5°C reported historically\\nContent: Typhoid fever typically presents with a gradually rising fever over several days, profound fatigue, and abdominal pain. Gastrointestinal manifestations may include constipation early in the illness, followed by diarrhea later. Physical examination can reveal abdominal tenderness and, in some cases, hepatosplenomegaly or faint rose-colored macules on the trunk (rose spots). These findings reflect systemic bacterial dissemination.\\n\\n[MANAGEMENT AND CLINICAL COURSE]\\nDisease: Acute Viral Gastroenteritis\\nFinal Diagnosis: Self-limited viral gastroenteritis\\nVitals: Mild dehydration noted\\nContent: Viral gastroenteritis often causes acute onset of diarrhea, vomiting, and low-grade fever lasting a few days. Symptoms usually improve with supportive care such as oral rehydration. Unlike invasive bacterial infections, fever does not typically show a progressive daily rise, and severe systemic fatigue is less prominent. Constipation is uncommon in purely viral causes.\n",

    "Diagnosis: Typhoid fever\n",
    "Explanation: A fever that rises each day, stomach pain, and extreme tiredness (fatigue) with alternating constipation and diarrhea fits the classic pattern described for typhoid/enteric fever more than typical viral gastroenteritis. The retrieved cases specifically note stepwise rising fever plus abdominal pain and constipation that can later shift to diarrhea, matching the symptom trajectory. Typhoid is caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and is commonly acquired from contaminated food or water, so confirmatory testing is needed. If symptoms worsen or dehydration develops, urgent medical evaluation is important.\n",

    "Question:\n",
    "A 35-year-old woman, currently living in New York after recently returning from a vacation to a Caribbean island, started experiencing sudden high fever, headache, fatigue, a rash, nausea, and red eyes about five days after her return. She has no known pre-existing conditions. After about two weeks, most of her initial symptoms improved, but she has continued to have significant joint and muscle pain for the past two months. What could be causing her prolonged joint and muscle pain after these initial symptoms, considering her recent travel?\n",

    "[Cardiovascular Disease Management]\\nContent: Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a chronic medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated. It is often asymptomatic but can lead to serious complications such as heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, and retinopathy if left untreated. Lifestyle modifications, including diet and exercise, are crucial for management, often supplemented by antihypertensive medications.\\n\\n[EXPOSURE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY]\\nDisease: Arboviral Infection\\nFinal Diagnosis: Suspected Chikungunya\\nVitals: Febrile, stable\\nContent: Mosquito-borne illnesses, transmitted by Aedes species, are common in the Caribbean. Initial presentation often includes abrupt high fever, severe headache, myalgia, and a maculopapular rash. Conjunctivitis can also be observed. The incubation period typically ranges from 3-7 days post-exposure, aligning with symptom onset experienced by travelers returning from affected regions.\\n\\n[SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS]\\nDisease: Dengue Fever\\nFinal Diagnosis: Dengue Fever\\nVitals: Febrile, stable\\nContent: Dengue fever, a common arboviral infection in tropical and subtropical regions, often presents with sudden onset of high fever, severe headache (often retro-orbital), myalgia, and arthralgia. A characteristic maculopapular rash can appear 3-5 days after fever onset. Nausea and vomiting are common. While joint pains are present, they are typically less severe and less prolonged than in Chikungunya, resolving within a few weeks of illness onset. Bleeding manifestations can occur, particularly in severe cases.\\n\\n[Post-Chikungunya Chronic Arthralgia]\\nContent: A hallmark of Chikungunya virus infection is the potential for debilitating polyarthralgia that can persist for weeks, months, or even years after the acute febrile illness, particularly in adults. Travelers returning from endemic areas, such as the Caribbean, are at risk. This chronic joint pain often affects multiple joints, including small joints of the hands and feet, and can significantly impair daily activities, requiring long-term management.\n",

    "## Response format:\n",
    "Diagnosis: Chikungunya\n",
    "Explanation: The abrupt high fever, headache, rash, nausea, and red eyes (conjunctivitis) starting about five days after Caribbean travel fits an Aedes-borne arboviral illness, and the prolonged joint and muscle pain (persistent arthralgia/myalgia) strongly supports chikungunya. The retrieved cases note incubation of ~3–7 days and highlight chronic polyarthralgia lasting months as a hallmark feature, which matches the course described. Dengue can cause body aches but typically does not cause months-long debilitating joint pain. Confirmation is usually via appropriate serology/PCR depending on timing, and management focuses on supportive care and pain control.\"\"\""

       " \"[FEVER]\\nContent: Prolonged fever is common, especially among patients with low CD4 cell counts (e.g. < 200 cells/ml) who are not receiving ART [151], and differential  diagnosis  is  broad  and  varies  geographically.  Infectious etiologies are responsible for the majority of fevers.\\nTuberculosis should be considered in all patients with fever especially if cough, shortness of breath, weight loss, night sweats, or lymphadenopathy are present (see Chapter 39, ' Tuberculosis ') [131]. Other causes of fever are cryptococcal disease (e.g. C. neoformans bloodstream infection),  bacteremia  (e.g. Salmonella , Rhodococcus ),  pneumonia,  both bacterial (e.g. S.  pneumoniae )  and  fungal (e.g. PCP), malaria, CMV, and lymphoma. Multiple concurrent etiologies occur.\\nThe  diagnostic  work-up  for  fever  should  be  driven  by  the  clinical presentation and availability of diagnostic tests. Blood cultures, blood smear for malaria, mycobacterial blood cultures and serum cryptococcal antigen testing can be helpful. Chest radiography, urine culture, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, and other radiologic studies (e.g. brain imaging, abdominal imaging) may be necessary. Certain etiologies such as mycobacterial disease, Pneumocystis , Bartonella , lymphoma and certain fungal infections can be particularly difficult to diagnose and  should  be  considered  when  fever  persists  despite  a  diagnostic work-up.\\n\\n---\\n[SYMPTOMS]\\nContent: - Fever, fatigue, chills, sweats, headache, myalgia, anorexia, non-productive cough, arthralgia and nausea\\n- Less common: emotional lability and depression, hyperesthesia, sore throat, abdominal pain, conjunctival injection, photophobia and weight loss\\n\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Tuberculous Lymphadenitis with Paradoxical IRIS\\nFinal Diagnosis: The final diagnosis was tuberculous lymphadenitis with superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis, complicated by paradoxical immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). The initial diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis was confirmed by an AFB-positive fine-needle aspirate from a neck gland. The paradoxical IRIS was diagnosed clinically based on his worsening condition after starting ART, despite evidence of a good virologic and immunologic response. The superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis, likely with Staphylococcus aureus, was confirmed by the second aspirate showing purulent material with coccoid bacteria and the patient's rapid improvement following incision, drainage, and antibiotics.\\nVitals: On presentation, he was febrile with a temperature of 39.2 °C (102.56° F). His pulse was 112 bpm, respiratory rate was 28 breaths per minute, and he had a normal blood pressure.\\nContent: For six weeks, the patient has experienced a productive cough and chest pain, associated with systemic symptoms including weight loss, fevers, and night sweats. During this period, he also developed a painful swelling in his neck. He has no other reported symptoms.\\n\\n---\\n[SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS]\\nContent: Typically, the disease begins with the abrupt onset of intense headache, fever, chills, and myalgia. Fever often exceeds 40°C (103°F) and is preceded by rigors. Muscle pain can be excruciating and occurs most commonly in the thighs, calves, lumbosacral region, and abdomen. Abdominal  wall  pain  accompanied  by  palpation  tenderness  can mimic an acute surgical abdomen. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and sore throat are other frequent symptoms. Cough and chest pain figure prominently in reports of patients from Korea and China.\\nConjunctival suffusion is a helpful diagnostic clue that usually appears two  or  three  days  after  the  onset  of  fever  and  involves  the  bulbar conjunctiva.  Pus  and  serous  secretions  are  absent  and  there  is  no matting  of  the  eyelashes  and  eyelids.  Mild  suffusion  can  easily  be overlooked. Less common and less distinctive signs include pharyngeal injection, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and skin  lesions.  Within  a  week,  most  patients  become  asymptomatic. After several days of apparent recovery, the illness resumes in some individuals. Manifestations of the second stage are more variable and mild than those of the initial illness and usually last 2-4 days. Leptospires  disappear  from  the  blood,  cerebrospinal  fluid  (CSF),  and tissues, but appear in the urine. Serum antibody titers rise - hence the term  'immune'  phase.  Meningitis  is  the  hallmark  of  this  stage  of leptospirosis. Pleocytosis of the CSF can be demonstrated in 80-90% of all patients during the second week of illness, although only about 50% will have clinical signs and symptoms of meningitis. Meningeal signs can last several weeks, but usually resolve within a day or two. Uveitis  is  a  late  manifestation  of  leptospirosis,  generally  seen  4-8 months after the illness has begun. The anterior uveal tract is most frequently affected and pain, photophobia, and blurring of vision are the usual symptoms.\\n\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Histoplasmosis\\nFinal Diagnosis: The final diagnosis is disseminated histoplasmosis caused by the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. This was confirmed by the identification of the organism in a submandibular lymph node biopsy via both PCR and subsequent culture. The clinical presentation of disseminated abscesses, osteomyelitis, and generalized lymphadenopathy, along with the patient's travel history to an endemic region in northern Thailand, supported the diagnosis. The dramatic clinical and laboratory response to specific antifungal therapy further confirmed the etiology.\\nVitals: On admission, the patient was afebrile with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg and a pulse of 80 bpm.\\nContent: The patient developed recurrent skin and subcutaneous abscesses, progressive lymphadenopathy, and weight loss over a two-month period. Her symptoms began 6 to 8 weeks after she returned from a family visit to northern Thailand. During that trip, she had experienced an illness with high fever, dry cough, and fatigue, which may have represented acute pulmonary histoplasmosis. Despite various antibiotic therapies prior to transfer, her clinical symptoms and inflammatory markers deteriorated. Initial pus and blood cultures were sterile, and a lymph node biopsy showed non-specific lymphadenitis.\"]"

I live in Sarh area in Southeast Chari.\\n\\n# Retrieved cases\\n[FEVER]\\nContent: Prolonged fever is common, especially among patients with low CD4 cell counts (e.g. < 200 cells/ml) who are not receiving ART [151], and differential  diagnosis  is  broad  and  varies  geographically.  Infectious etiologies are responsible for the majority of fevers.\\nTuberculosis should be considered in all patients with fever especially if cough, shortness of breath, weight loss, night sweats, or lymphadenopathy are present (see Chapter 39, ' Tuberculosis ') [131]. Other causes of fever are cryptococcal disease (e.g. C. neoformans bloodstream infection),  bacteremia  (e.g. Salmonella , Rhodococcus ),  pneumonia,  both bacterial (e.g. S.  pneumoniae )  and  fungal (e.g. PCP), malaria, CMV, and lymphoma. Multiple concurrent etiologies occur.\\nThe  diagnostic  work-up  for  fever  should  be  driven  by  the  clinical presentation and availability of diagnostic tests. Blood cultures, blood smear for malaria, mycobacterial blood cultures and serum cryptococcal antigen testing can be helpful. Chest radiography, urine culture, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, and other radiologic studies (e.g. brain imaging, abdominal imaging) may be necessary. Certain etiologies such as mycobacterial disease, Pneumocystis , Bartonella , lymphoma and certain fungal infections can be particularly difficult to diagnose and  should  be  considered  when  fever  persists  despite  a  diagnostic work-up.\\n\\n---\\n[SYMPTOMS]\\nContent: - Fever, fatigue, chills, sweats, headache, myalgia, anorexia, non-productive cough, arthralgia and nausea\\n- Less common: emotional lability and depression, hyperesthesia, sore throat, abdominal pain, conjunctival injection, photophobia and weight loss\\n\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Tuberculous Lymphadenitis with Paradoxical IRIS\\nFinal Diagnosis: The final diagnosis was tuberculous lymphadenitis with superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis, complicated by paradoxical immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). The initial diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis was confirmed by an AFB-positive fine-needle aspirate from a neck gland. The paradoxical IRIS was diagnosed clinically based on his worsening condition after starting ART, despite evidence of a good virologic and immunologic response. The superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis, likely with Staphylococcus aureus, was confirmed by the second aspirate showing purulent material with coccoid bacteria and the patient's rapid improvement following incision, drainage, and antibiotics.\\nVitals: On presentation, he was febrile with a temperature of 39.2 °C (102.56° F). His pulse was 112 bpm, respiratory rate was 28 breaths per minute, and he had a normal blood pressure.\\nContent: For six weeks, the patient has experienced a productive cough and chest pain, associated with systemic symptoms including weight loss, fevers, and night sweats. During this period, he also developed a painful swelling in his neck. He has no other reported symptoms.\\n\\n---\\n[SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS]\\nContent: Typically, the disease begins with the abrupt onset of intense headache, fever, chills, and myalgia. Fever often exceeds 40°C (103°F) and is preceded by rigors. Muscle pain can be excruciating and occurs most commonly in the thighs, calves, lumbosacral region, and abdomen. Abdominal  wall  pain  accompanied  by  palpation  tenderness  can mimic an acute surgical abdomen. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and sore throat are other frequent symptoms. Cough and chest pain figure prominently in reports of patients from Korea and China.\\nConjunctival suffusion is a helpful diagnostic clue that usually appears two  or  three  days  after  the  onset  of  fever  and  involves  the  bulbar conjunctiva.  Pus  and  serous  secretions  are  absent  and  there  is  no matting  of  the  eyelashes  and  eyelids.  Mild  suffusion  can  easily  be overlooked. Less common and less distinctive signs include pharyngeal injection, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and skin  lesions.  Within  a  week,  most  patients  become  asymptomatic. After several days of apparent recovery, the illness resumes in some individuals. Manifestations of the second stage are more variable and mild than those of the initial illness and usually last 2-4 days. Leptospires  disappear  from  the  blood,  cerebrospinal  fluid  (CSF),  and tissues, but appear in the urine. Serum antibody titers rise - hence the term  'immune'  phase.  Meningitis  is  the  hallmark  of  this  stage  of leptospirosis. Pleocytosis of the CSF can be demonstrated in 80-90% of all patients during the second week of illness, although only about 50% will have clinical signs and symptoms of meningitis. Meningeal signs can last several weeks, but usually resolve within a day or two. Uveitis  is  a  late  manifestation  of  leptospirosis,  generally  seen  4-8 months after the illness has begun. The anterior uveal tract is most frequently affected and pain, photophobia, and blurring of vision are the usual symptoms.\\n\\n---\\n[HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS]\\nDisease: Histoplasmosis\\nFinal Diagnosis: The final diagnosis is disseminated histoplasmosis caused by the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. This was confirmed by the identification of the organism in a submandibular lymph node biopsy via both PCR and subsequent culture. The clinical presentation of disseminated abscesses, osteomyelitis, and generalized lymphadenopathy, along with the patient's travel history to an endemic region in northern Thailand, supported the diagnosis. The dramatic clinical and laboratory response to specific antifungal therapy further confirmed the etiology.\\nVitals: On admission, the patient was afebrile with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg and a pulse of 80 bpm.\\nContent: The patient developed recurrent skin and subcutaneous abscesses, progressive lymphadenopathy, and weight loss over a two-month period. Her symptoms began 6 to 8 weeks after she returned from a family visit to northern Thailand. During that trip, she had experienced an illness with high fever, dry cough, and fatigue, which may have represented acute pulmonary histoplasmosis. Despite various antibiotic therapies prior to transfer, her clinical symptoms and inflammatory markers deteriorated. Initial pus and blood cultures were sterile, and a lymph node biopsy showed non-specific lymphadenitis.\"},\n",

Is this something serious or just a normal infection?\\n\\nRetrieved cases from RAG pipeline\\n[EXPOSURE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY]\\nDisease: Enteric Fever\\nFinal Diagnosis: Suspected enteric infection related to Salmonella species\\nVitals: Not documented\\nContent: Enteric fever remains endemic in parts of South and Southeast Asia, particularly in areas with limited access to clean water and sanitation. Infection commonly follows ingestion of food or drinking water contaminated with human feces. Travelers or residents in rural or peri-urban settings are at increased risk, especially during warmer months when bacterial proliferation in water supplies is more likely. Person-to-person transmission can occur in households with poor hand hygiene.\\n\\n[Clinical Features]\\nContent: Patients with prolonged febrile illnesses in tropical regions may develop nonspecific gastrointestinal complaints. Alternating constipation and diarrhea can occur in systemic infections affecting the intestinal lymphoid tissue. Marked fatigue, abdominal discomfort, and anorexia are common, and fever often shows a stepwise daily increase rather than abrupt spikes. These features overlap with other causes of undifferentiated tropical fever, making clinical diagnosis challenging.\\n\\n[SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS]\\nDisease: Typhoid Fever\\nFinal Diagnosis: Typhoid fever caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi\\nVitals: Temperature up to 39.5°C reported historically\\nContent: Typhoid fever typically presents with a gradually rising fever over several days, profound fatigue, and abdominal pain. Gastrointestinal manifestations may include constipation early in the illness, followed by diarrhea later. Physical examination can reveal abdominal tenderness and, in some cases, hepatosplenomegaly or faint rose-colored macules on the trunk (rose spots). These findings reflect systemic bacterial dissemination.\\n\\n[MANAGEMENT AND CLINICAL COURSE]\\nDisease: Acute Viral Gastroenteritis\\nFinal Diagnosis: Self-limited viral gastroenteritis\\nVitals: Mild dehydration noted\\nContent: Viral gastroenteritis often causes acute onset of diarrhea, vomiting, and low-grade fever lasting a few days. Symptoms usually improve with supportive care such as oral rehydration. Unlike invasive bacterial infections, fever does not typically show a progressive daily rise, and severe systemic fatigue is less prominent. Constipation is uncommon in purely viral causes.\\n\\nOutput:\\nDiagnosis: Typhoid fever\\nExplanation: A fever that rises each day, stomach pain, and extreme tiredness (fatigue) with alternating constipation and diarrhea fits the classic pattern described for typhoid/enteric fever more than typical viral gastroenteritis. The retrieved cases specifically note stepwise rising fever plus abdominal pain and constipation that can later shift to diarrhea, matching the symptom trajectory. Typhoid is caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and is commonly acquired from contaminated food or water, so confirmatory testing is needed. If symptoms worsen or dehydration develops, urgent medical evaluation is important.\\n\\nExample 2\\nUser prompt:\\nUse the retrieved cases below as your main evidence when helpful.\\n\\nUser question\\nA 35-year-old woman, currently living in New York after recently returning from a vacation to a Caribbean island, started experiencing sudden high fever, headache, fatigue, a rash, nausea, and red eyes about five days after her return. She has no known pre-existing conditions. After about two weeks, most of her initial symptoms improved, but she has continued to have significant joint and muscle pain for the past two months. What could be causing her prolonged joint and muscle pain after these initial symptoms, considering her recent travel?\\n\\nRetrieved cases from RAG pipeline\\n[Cardiovascular Disease Management]\\nContent: Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a chronic medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated. It is often asymptomatic but can lead to serious complications such as heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, and retinopathy if left untreated. Lifestyle modifications, including diet and exercise, are crucial for management, often supplemented by antihypertensive medications.\\n\\n[EXPOSURE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY]\\nDisease: Arboviral Infection\\nFinal Diagnosis: Suspected Chikungunya\\nVitals: Febrile, stable\\nContent: Mosquito-borne illnesses, transmitted by Aedes species, are common in the Caribbean. Initial presentation often includes abrupt high fever, severe headache, myalgia, and a maculopapular rash. Conjunctivitis can also be observed. The incubation period typically ranges from 3-7 days post-exposure, aligning with symptom onset experienced by travelers returning from affected regions.\\n\\n[SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS]\\nDisease: Dengue Fever\\nFinal Diagnosis: Dengue Fever\\nVitals: Febrile, stable\\nContent: Dengue fever, a common arboviral infection in tropical and subtropical regions, often presents with sudden onset of high fever, severe headache (often retro-orbital), myalgia, and arthralgia. A characteristic maculopapular rash can appear 3-5 days after fever onset. Nausea and vomiting are common. While joint pains are present, they are typically less severe and less prolonged than in Chikungunya, resolving within a few weeks of illness onset. Bleeding manifestations can occur, particularly in severe cases.\\n\\n[Post-Chikungunya Chronic Arthralgia]\\nContent: A hallmark of Chikungunya virus infection is the potential for debilitating polyarthralgia that can persist for weeks, months, or even years after the acute febrile illness, particularly in adults. Travelers returning from endemic areas, such as the Caribbean, are at risk. This chronic joint pain often affects multiple joints, including small joints of the hands and feet, and can significantly impair daily activities, requiring long-term management.\\n\\nOutput:\\nDiagnosis: Chikungunya\\nExplanation: The abrupt high fever, headache, rash, nausea, and red eyes (conjunctivitis) starting about five days after Caribbean travel fits an Aedes-borne arboviral illness, and the prolonged joint and muscle pain (persistent arthralgia/myalgia) strongly supports chikungunya. The retrieved cases note incubation of ~3–7 days and highlight chronic polyarthralgia lasting months as a hallmark feature, which matches the course described. Dengue can cause body aches but typically does not cause months-long debilitating joint pain. Confirmation is usually via appropriate serology/PCR depending on timing, and management focuses on supportive care and pain control.\"}]},\n",
