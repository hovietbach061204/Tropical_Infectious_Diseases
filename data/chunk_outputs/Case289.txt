INTRODUCTION
Lymphogranuloma  venereum  (LGV),  along  with  gonorrhea, syphilis,  chancroid,  and  donovanosis,  is  one  of  the  {ve  classic venereal diseases. There is considerable confusion about terminology, especially between donovanosis and LGV (Table 53.1).

============================================================

============================================================
Geographic Distribution
LGV has a worldwide distribution but is more prevalent in tropical and subtropical areas.  In  the  last  decade  LGV  has  emerged  in developed  countries  in  North  America,  Europe,  and  Australia where recent outbreaks have been reported among men having sex with men (MSM). 1,2 LGV remains endemic in parts of Africa, India, Southeast Asia, the Caribbean, and Brazil. Prevalence depends on the quality of diagnostic facilities, sexual preferences, and the training of health care personnel.

============================================================
Transmission
LGV is a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Major sources are asymptomatic carriers, especially women with LGV endocervicitis. The frequency of infection after exposure seems to be relatively low, although the actual risk of infection is unknown. Extragenital transmission, mostly in laboratory infections, occasionally occurs. Autoinfection (conjunctivitis) is possible.
LGV is six times more frequently observed in men. However, delayed complications, such as lymphedema or rectal strictures, are more commonly reported among women. LGV in MSM can resemble  in|ammatory  bowel  disease  presenting  with  rectal ulceration, bleedings, tenesmus, and lower abdominal cramping, as well as perirectal abscesses and {ssures.
The destruction of mucous membranes at the port of invasion seems to be a predominant factor in the transmission of HIV.

ETIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY
A relationship between inguinal buboes and granulomas was {rst observed in the 18th century. The {rst description of LGV was by Wallace in 1833. With the introduction of the {rst serologic tests for venereal diseases by Wassermann in 1906, separation of syphilis from other ulcerative STIs became possible. The {rst full description of LGV was given in 1913 by Durand, Nicolas, and Favré. The  introduction of an intradermal  skin  test  by  Frei  in 1925 allowed a distinct diagnosis of lesions, formerly called climatic or tropical bubo, and connected the late complications of elephantiasis and rectal stricture with LGV. With the isolation and culture of Chlamydiae in the 1930s and the introduction of speci{c serologic tests  in  the  1960s,  the  natural  history  of  LGV  could  be  fully described. Advances in immunology and molecular biology in the last  decades of the 20th century led to a new understanding of the disease. DNA ampli{cation tests began to replace cell culture as the gold standard of diagnosis.
Chlamydiae are highly specialized, obligate, intracellular gramnegative bacteria with a unique reproductive cycle (see Chapter 52).  Whereas  the  other  serovars  of C.  trachomatis all  produce super{cial epithelial infections of mucous membranes in the eyes, genitalia, or respiratory system, serovars L1-L3 (the 'LGV strains') display a distinct invasive behavior in lymphatic tissue. They grow rapidly in cell culture, show enhanced resistance to phagocytosis, and kill mice after intracerebral inoculation.

============================================================

============================================================
ETIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY
LGV is primarily a lymphatic disease. Chlamydia gain access to lymphatic vessels through microtrauma of the skin or mucous membranes. Being partly the result of an excessive T-cell-mediated immune response,  the  leading  pathologic  feature  of  LGV  is  a progressive  thrombolymphangitis.  Endothelial  cells  along  the lymphatic  vessel  walls  proliferate,  {nally  causing  stenosis  and obstruction,  and  the  in|ammatory  reaction  spreads  to  the  surrounding tissue. Regional lymph nodes are invaded by neutrophils and mononuclear macrophages, leading to granuloma formation and the characteristic three- or four-cornered 'stellate' microabscesses,  {nally  resolving  in  progressive  {brosis  and  scarring. Although the immune system is capable of suppressing chlamydial replication, it usually cannot completely eradicate the organism that can persist for decades in local lesions. 3

CLINICAL FEATURES
LGV is a systemic disease with three distinct stages. The clinical features vary according to gender and sexual practices of the patient. Immunosuppression-for example, underlying HIV disease-seems to result in more severe and prolonged symptoms.

============================================================
CHUNK 9
============================================================
Primary Lymphogranuloma Venereum
A small papule, erosion, or ulcer develops at the site of infection (usually penis, labia, vulva, or cervix) after an incubation period varying from 3 to 30 days. The initial lesion is inconspicuous and may resemble herpes simplex infection, but is usually painless. It is  more  often  seen  in  men,  with  a  ratio  of  four  men  to  every woman, and heals spontaneously after a few days.
Other locations of primary LGV are the anus, rectum, or urethra. Extragenital  manifestations  are  rare-the  best  known  being  a conjunctivitis with pre-auricular lymphadenopathy and lymphedema
TABLE 53.1 Terminology of Donovanosis and Lymphogranuloma Venereum

Infectious agent, Donovanosis = Calymmatobacterium granulomatis. Infectious agent, Lymphogranuloma Venereum = Chlamydia trachomatis L1, L2, L3. Synonyms, Donovanosis = Granuloma inguinale Granuloma venereum. Synonyms, Lymphogranuloma Venereum = Lymphopathia venereum Lymphogranuloma inguinale Tropical bubo, climatic bubo Durand-Nicolas-Favré disease

of the eyelid (Parinaud's oculoglandular syndrome), usually after autoinfection. Reactive polyarthropathy also exists, with the most commonly affected joints being wrists, knees, ankles, or elbows.

============================================================
CHUNK 10
============================================================
Secondary Lymphogranuloma Venereum
From the  site  of  the  primary  lesion,  the  infection  reaches  the neighboring lymph nodes, resulting in an extensive in|ammation of  the  regional  lymphatic  tissue. This  feature  is  often  the  {rst noted presentation of  the  disease  and  seen  at  a  time  when  the primary lesion has already healed.

============================================================
CHUNK 11
============================================================
Inguinal Syndrome
If the port of entry were the outer genitals either in women or men, most commonly, patients present with an 'inguinal syndrome,' a painful inguinal lymphadenopathy that usually develops 2 to 6 weeks after the initial infection. The in|ammation starts unilaterally but tends to spread to the other side in about  a third of  cases. Progressive periadenitis involves the overlying skin. Small abscesses coalesce, forming buboes that may rupture spontaneously. Multiple {stulae and sinuses break open and discharge purulent |uid. The enlargement of lymph nodes above and below the inguinal ligament results in a characteristic 'groove sign' (Fig. 53.1). After several months, spontaneous healing occurs, leaving extensive scars and masses of {brotic granulomatous tissue. Relapse occurs in about 20% of untreated cases.
Constitutional symptoms are common during the secondary stage  of  LGV ,  indicating  dissemination  of  the  infection.  Fever, malaise, and myalgia are reported by most patients. Meningism, arthralgia, and other extra-genital manifestations are less frequent. Severe systemic infection after hematogenous spread is usually a feature  of  severely  immunosuppressed  patients.  The  inguinal syndrome, together with a fulminant septic presentation and fever, can be indistinguishable from bubonic plague.

============================================================
CHUNK 12
============================================================
Anorectal Syndrome
An LGV-associated anorectal syndrome is most commonly reported in MSM. Patients present with a hemorrhagic proctitis or proctocolitis resembling histologically chronic ulcerative (in|ammatory) bowel disease. 4 Extensive lymphadenopathy may develop in the pelvic,  obturator,  or  iliac  area,  leading  to  complaints  of  lower abdominal or back pains. When left untreated, the condition may result in rectal {stulae, perirectal abscess formation, adhesion of the rectum to the pelvic wall, and rectal strictures, usually with a long and tubular appearance. The anorectal syndrome mostly is not seen together with the inguinal syndrome.

============================================================
CHUNK 13
============================================================
Tertiary Lymphogranuloma Venereum
Late  complications  of  untreated  LGV  may  appear  months  or years after the initial infection in about 25% of inappropriately treated  patients.  Obstruction  of  lymphatic  vessels  results  in lymphedema  and  elephantiasis  of  the  external  genitalia  and sometimes the lower limbs. Patients with these presentations are rare except in areas with very limited health facilities.

============================================================
CHUNK 14
============================================================
Microscopic Diagnosis
LGV cannot be diagnosed exclusively on clinical grounds; specialized  laboratory  examinations  are  required.  Smears,  scrapings, aspirated material, or biopsies can be Giemsa-stained and examined for inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm of macrophages or stellate abscesses in tissue sections. Microscopic examination has a low sensitivity and speci{city that can be enhanced by using |uoresceinconjugated  monoclonal  antibodies  and  immuno|uorescence. Elevated white blood cell count in the anorectal swab ( > 10 per high-power {eld) raises sensitivity. 5

============================================================
CHUNK 15
============================================================
Molecular Diagnosis
Isolation and strain differentiation in cell culture is an expensive and technically demanding  method that  was formerly the  gold standard for the diagnosis of LGV. This method has now been largely replaced by nucleic acid ampli{cation techniques (NAAT) that enable direct pathogen detection in smears and affected tissues. The diagnosis of a C. trachomatis infection can be established by sequencing the outer membrane protein A ( ompA ) gene.

============================================================
CHUNK 16
============================================================
Antibody Detection Tests
Antibody detection tests are of limited value for diagnosing LGV . Normally,  a  fourfold  or  greater  increase  in  a  speci{c  titer  is considered diagnostic. Several test assays are available based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), complement {xation, or indirect immuno|uorescence techniques. The intradermal skin test (Frei test) is historical and no longer in use.

============================================================
CHUNK 17
============================================================
Antibiotic Treatment
Antibiotics can stop progressive in|ammation but cannot prevent tissue destruction and scarring. The treatment of choice for LGV
is  doxycycline  100 mg  bid  or  200 mg  once  daily  for  21  days. Alternatively, tetracycline 500 mg qid can be used. Resistance to these antibiotics is not known. T reatment failure is usually a result of misdiagnosis, poor compliance, or re-infection-in immunosuppressed (i.e., HIV) patients a prolonged course might be necessary.
Should tetracyclines be contraindicated (i.e., in pregnant and lactating women), erythromycin (500 mg qid for 21 days), azithromycin (1 g weekly for 21 days), rifampicin, or chloramphenicol can be used. Comparative studies have not been done. The activity of |uoroquinolones, though having demonstrated anti-chlamydial activity (such as o|oxacin or levo|oxacin), is uncertain; moxi|oxacin has shown effectiveness after doxycycline treatment failure. Penicillins, cephalosporines, and aminoglycosides are not effective. 6

============================================================
CHUNK 18
============================================================
Surgical Treatment
Pus  from  buboes  should  be  aspirated  and  drained,  and  {stulas should receive clean dressings. The severe deformities of tertiary LGV can only be treated with plastic surgery, which should only be  performed  after  a  prolonged  course  of  antibiotics.  Patients with extensive scarring should be monitored at least annually and, if  necessary,  suspicious  lesions  should  be  biopsied  to  assess  for presence of malignancy.

============================================================
CHUNK 19
============================================================
PREVENTION
As the most common route of infection is via unprotected sexual intercourse, most infections could be avoided by using condoms. However, even in couples with steady sex partners asymptomatic carriers can occur. Screening of MSM who present with symptoms of in|ammatory bowel disease should be tested for Chlamydia and treated with doxycycline even before test results come back.
