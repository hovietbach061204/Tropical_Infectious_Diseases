Key features
- Medical tourism is the practice of traveling outside of a patient's local area for the purpose of accessing medical services; this often includes international travel
- Associated risks include risks known within travel medicine, such as the risk of acquiring tropical diseases and the additional risks related to the medical or surgical treatment
- Quality control, risk, and safety of treatment facilities in the destination country are key issues but di!cult to control, especially if the provider is not engaged in independent accreditation or a robust external review process
- Patients can return to their home country with ongoing needs related to their treatment and problems resulting from having traveled overseas
- Medical tourism raises ethical and legal issues that merit further clari"cation

INTRODUCTION
Throughout  history  people  have  traveled  for  reasons  of  accessing healthcare. The Ancient Greeks were possibly the first to lay the foundations of a medical tourism network when, in honour of Aesculapius, the God of medicine, they erected the Asculepia Temples. These became organized health centers to which people traveled from all over the ancient world. In 1248 AD, the Mansuri Hospital was built in Egypt and it became the largest and most advanced hospital in the world, with a capacity of 8000 people; it was a magnet for foreigners seeking  healthcare,  regardless  of  race  or  religion.  During  the  16th century, Europe's wealthy elite rediscovered Roman baths and flocked to spa towns such as Bath, St Moritz, Ville d'Eaux, Aachen, and Baden Baden to 'take the waters' on the promise that it would prove beneficial for a vast variety of conditions.
From the end of the 20th century there has been increasing growth in the movement of patients, medical technology, capital funding and healthcare professionals across national borders. This has internationalized the delivery of medical services. The phenomenon known as 'medical  tourism'  (or  sometimes  medical  travel)  has  arisen  for several reasons. Patients travel because of high costs of healthcare in their home country, excessive delays in accessing a medical or surgical intervention, and to seek treatments that may be considered inadequate, unsafe or unavailable in their home countries [1].
Medical  tourism  has  given  rise  to  new  risks  emerging  from  the medical/surgical treatment and from the international travel. Therefore, it represents a means by which:
- persons  will  travel  to  potentially  unfamiliar  places  where  they may come into contact with unfamiliar diseases, including tropical diseases;

- microorganisms can be transported across international borders, some  of  which  may  be  antibiotic  resistant  or  unfamiliar  to medical staff in the country of origin;
- new challenges  are  generated  for  domestic  healthcare  provider systems as they see returned travelers with post-treatment complications;
- new ethical and quality assurance dilemmas are generated.

WHAT SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE VIA MEDICAL TOURISM?
Marketing material, both print and internet-based, indicate that the range of investigations and treatments available around the world for medical tourists vary widely. Examples include:
- health check-ups and diagnostics;
- cosmetic  surgery,  for  example  liposuction,  dermabrasion,  and breast, face, and botox injections;
- cardiology/cardiac  surgery,  for  example  coronary  revascularization, percutaneous transluminal septal myocardial ablation;
- dentistry, for example cosmetic, reconstruction and implants;
- orthopedic surgery, for example hip replacement and resurfacing, knee replacement;
- bariatric surgery, for example gastric bypass, gastric banding;
- fertility/reproductive system, for example in vitro fertilization, preconception sex selection, transgender reassignment;
- organ,  cell  and  tissue  transplantation,  for  example  renal  and hemi-liver transplantation;
- eye  surgery,  for  example refractive  surgery such  as laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK), cataract surgery;
- opiate and alcohol detoxification services;
- spa services;
- Complementary and traditional medicine services,  for example Ayurvedic medicine, Chinese traditional medicine.
Some of these procedures may not be legal or acceptable in all regions of the world.

HOW MANY MEDICAL TOURISTS ARE THERE AND WHERE DO THEY COME FROM?
There are no reliable estimates of the number of medical tourists and their origin.
A  report  from  2007  authored  by  the  international  consultancy Deloitte, estimated that the number of US citizens seeking treatment outside of the USA was 750,000 [2]. US-origin medical tourists are thought to represent 9% of the worldwide number of medical tourists [3]. This indicates that annually there could be between 30 and 50 million traveling abroad for reasons of medical tourism. Support for these numbers comes from a report that a single hospital in Bangkok admitted about 430,000 patients in 2003, with that hospital admitting 93,000 Arab patients. Conservative estimates of medical tourism to  India  place  the  annual  number  at  150,000  and  the  equivalent figure for Singapore is around 400,000 [4]. In contrast, a US-based
study  in  2008  surveyed  45  companies  promoting  medical  tourism (representing  an  estimated  70%  of  companies  promoting  such services) found that only 13,500 US patients traveled for healthcare overseas [5].

============================================================
WHERE ARE MEDICAL TOURISM SERVICES PROVIDED?
The cost of accessing healthcare is much less in Asia [6], South and Central America, and Africa, and is one of the important drivers for the growth of medical tourism. However, the procedure or treatment cost  does  not  include  the  potential  increased  costs  related  to  poor standards of care and quality. Increasingly, facilities in Asia and South America  are  seeking  international  accreditation  as  an  important stamp of approval for their services.
Medical tourism destinations include:
- Asia: India, Malaysia, Singapore, Korea, and Thailand;
- the Middle East: Dubai;
- South Africa;
- South and Central America: Brazil, Costa Rica, and Mexico;
- eastern Europe: Hungary, Poland, and Ukraine;
- southern Europe and the Mediterranean: Cyprus and Malta.
Estimates of the number of country-specific medical tourists that are based on industry sources may be biased and inaccurate.

INFECTION-RELATED RISKS
Some procedures carry the risk of hemorrhage and the need for blood product  transfusions,  with  attendant  risks  of  blood-borne  viruses, such as HIV and hepatitis B [7]. Other pathogens, such as Trypanosoma cruzi , may be a risk in Latin America [8]. The cross-border transmission  of  antimicrobial  resistance  as  a  consequence  of  undergoing surgery overseas has been well-described [9].
Rabies [10] and West Nile Virus have been transmitted at the time of transplantation [1 1].
If  such  events  are  to  be  avoided,  it  is  necessary  that  hospitals  and clinics providing medical tourism services maintain the highest standards  of  clinical  governance.  Ensuring  that  this  is  the  case  is  a challenge.
A  second  area  of  relevance  is  the  need  for  pre-travel  preventative medicine. Some countries (e.g. India, Thailand, Brazil) where medical tourism services are advertised are also countries where people travel for holiday, business, or to visit friends and relatives. For these travelers,  as  well  as  medical  tourists,  there  is  the  need  to  seek  pre-travel advice and prevention measures for malaria and other tropical diseases. As examples, non-vaccine-preventable diseases, such as dengue and  chikungunya,  can  be  a  risk  in  South  Asia;  food-  and  watertransmitted  enteric  infection  are  widely  distributed;  and  personal safety  and  the  prevention  of  sexually  transmitted  infections  are  all important.
Medical  tourists  may  also  need  advice  regarding  the  prevention  of deep venous thrombosis during long-distance air flights, particularly on the return journey. This could involve fitted lower-extremity compression stockings or the use of low molecular weight heparin.

QUALITY CONTROL, SAFETY, AND RISK
Provision  of  healthcare  is  a  complex  and  challenging  process  with medical, dental, social, political, ethical, business, and financial ramifications. For example, there cannot be effective infection control in a  hospital  ward, outpatient clinic,  kitchen, mortuary,  laboratory, or blood  bank  without  good  governance  in  place  throughout  the organization.
Medical  tourism  compounds  these  difficulties;  only  through  independent and transparent scrutiny is it possible to establish if a hospital, clinic or staff member is fit for purpose and functioning in a safe
way.  Worldwide,  independent  external  assessment  is  increasingly being used to regulate, improve and market healthcare providers in the medical tourism field. The most common models are accreditation, peer review, statutory inspection, International Organization for Standardization (ISO) certification and evaluation (usually internal) against the 'business excellence' framework [12].
The most robust model, from a clinical perspective, is accreditation.
'Accreditation is usually a voluntary  program,  sponsored  by  a non-governmental  agency  (NGO),  in  which  trained  external  peer reviewers evaluate a health care organization's compliance with preestablished performance standards. Accreditation addresses organizational, rather than individual practitioner, capability or performance. Unlike  licensure,  accreditation  focuses  on  continuous  improvement strategies  and  achievement  of  optimal  quality  standards,  rather than  adherence  to  minimal  standards  intended  to  assure  public safety' [13].
Accreditation  systems  are  structured  to  provide  objective  measures for  evaluation  of  quality  management  in  a  hospital  or  clinic; the  results  can  be  used  by  the  general  public,  governments,  and third-party payers, as examples.  Independent accreditation schemes include  the  Joint  Commission  International  (JCI)  from  the  USA, QHA  Trent  Accreditation  from  the  UK  and  Accreditation  Canada International. Currently, it is not compulsory for private sector providers,  such  as  hospitals  and  clinics,  to  go  through  independent accreditation  anywhere  in  the  world.  However,  without  accreditation, it may not be possible for persons with private health insurance to  seek  reimbursement.  Additionally,  without  reputable  external scrutiny,  it  is  challenging  to  see  how  interested  parties  can  have  a clear idea  whether a hospital or clinic will safely deliver  excellence in care.

QUALITY CONTROL, SAFETY, AND RISK
When  complaints  arise  concerning  the  delivery  of  healthcare,  for example  an  incident  of  medical  negligence  or  a  medical  accident affecting a medical tourist, it may be difficult, or impossible, to obtain a satisfactory resolution of the problem within a foreign legal jurisdiction. In some countries, for example Malaysia and Singapore, doctors routinely  carry  medical  indemnity  from  organizations  such  as  the Medical Protection Society (UK), which will help protect patients and providers if successful legal action is taken. However, in other countries, such as Thailand or India, it is not routine for doctors to subscribe  to  a  medical  indemnity  organisation  [4]  and  hence  medical tourists might not enjoy the same level of protection in the event of an iatrogenic injury.
The  lack  of  legal  safeguards  is  occasionally  taken  advantage  of  by patients, such as when they seek stem cell injections to treat conditions where there is no scientific evidence to justify their usage [14], or pre-conception sex selection [15].
Deaths are also well documented among medical tourists. In 2005, the  wife  of  a  prominent  African  politician  died  after  undergoing liposuction  in  Spain  [16].  In  another  instance,  a  UK  resident went to the USA to receive cosmetic silicone injections and died of complications [17].

============================================================

============================================================
THE RETURNED MEDICAL TOURIST
Upon returning home, patients may require routine follow-up after undergoing gastric band surgery, for example. Sometimes, the overseas  medical  tourism  provider  will  make  arrangements  for  this  to happen in the patient's home country.
For  medical  tourists  who  return  ill,  it  should  be  established  if they are:
- ill from the surgery or treatment itself;
- ill because of a complication of the surgery, for example a wound infection, possibly with a multidrug resistant organism;
- ill because of an intervention associated with the surgery or treatment, for example a blood transfusion;
- ill secondary to the journey, for example deep venous thrombosis, with or without pulmonary embolus;
- ill as a result of acquiring a tropical disease, for example malaria or typhoid.
When complications have occurred as a result of treatment overseas as  a  medical tourist, the  patient's  medical insurance in their  home country may not always cover this care. This should be clarified before undergoing an overseas procedure. In addition, consular services may not always be available to medical tourists. As an example, UK travelers will not be contacted nor visited in the overseas country by Foreign and Commonwealth personnel if a complication occurs from treatment specifically arising from medical tourism.

============================================================
CONCLUSION
If an individual plans to become a medical tourist, the details of the procedure and the destination should be conveyed to the travel health provider so that proper prevention measures can be taken, for example hepatitis B vaccination and malaria chemoprophylaxis. Likewise, if a hemodialysis patient plans to have a kidney transplant overseas that might otherwise have been impossible  for them  to obtain  in their home country, steps can be taken prospectively by the home medical team to improve the outcome, such as outlining measures that should be taken to assure the survival of the transplanted kidney.
There remain ethical issues around medical tourism, such as concern about how organs for transplantation are obtained. These have yet to be adequately resolved, although there are international guidelines addressing the issue [18].
Primum non nocere can be a challenging maxim to apply to medical tourism, but as its prevalence increases it is increasingly something that healthcare workers and healthcare provider systems are going to have to confront. For some patients and healthcare systems, it has the power to provide answers for problems that might otherwise seem intractable.
