INTRODUCTION
Plague is a deadly zoonosis caused by Yersinia pestis , 1 a bacterium {rst isolated in 1894 by Alexandre Yersin in Hong Kong at the outset of the most recent pandemic, which is still ongoing. 2 Plague is a reportable and quarantinable disease covered by national and international  health  regulations.  Plague  has had a huge impact on humanity. It was probably the cause of the Justinian plague of plague in Europe in the Middle Ages that claimed one third of the affected population. 3 The current pandemic began in Asia in the end of the 19th century and now involves the Old and New World. Y. pestis genotyping indicates that ancient Y. pestis organisms belonged to an Orientalis-like biotype. 3

Michel Drancourt outbreaks can also occur as a result of the exposure of humans to infected  animals,  or  because  of  limited  direct  or  vector-borne inter-human transmission. In comparison, extensive and ongoing human outbreaks have been associated with the Orientalis biotype, including the current worldwide pandemic.

Animal Infection
Y.  pestis can  persist  in  soil  for  several  months,  particularly  in moderate salt soil, 4 contributing to the long-term persistence of regional plague foci and acting as a source of infection for burrowing rodents. 5 More  than 200 species  of rodents  can  be infected by Y.  pestis, with plague disease-resistant species being regarded as reservoirs for Y. pestis . 1,6 Several ectoparasites, including ticks, have been found to be naturally infected  with Y.  pestis, but  |eas  are thought to be the  vector  of primary importance. One hundred and thirty-one species of |eas are the most common vectors of Y. pestis among rodents. 1,6 Fleas are particularly effective at transmitting Y.  pestis, as  ingested Y.  pestis bacteria  express  plasminogen activator  Pla  that  leads  to  blockage  of  the  |ea  proventriculus, facilitating both increased hunger and therefore attempted feeding of the |ea and contamination of regurgitated blood back into the bite site. 1 Y. pestis has evolved numerous mechanisms to suppress in|ammatory responses in plague-resistant hosts, promoting high blood concentrations (up to 10 8 organisms/mL) and facilitating successful transmission via the small amount of blood ingested by a |ea (10 -4 mL).
Carnivores  can  be  infected  after  ingestion  of  contaminated rodents, but dogs and canids are resistant to plague 7 (Fig. 77.1). The complex life cycle of Y. pestis involving soil, ectoparasites, and mammals results in a variable prevalence of animal plague (enzoonosis) with sudden outbreaks of dying off in plague-susceptible animals (epizoonoses).

Human Plague (Fig. 77.2)
Inoculation by an infectious |ea or louse bite can result in bubonic plague. Infectious  |eas often  leave dead rodents and will drink human blood if rodents are not available. Fleas must have a daily blood meal in order to survive-the risk of being bitten by infected |eas is especially high after large numbers of plague-infected rats have  died. 1 Inoculation  through  skin  lacerations  may  result  in bubonic or septicemic plague after handling (typically skinning) dead animals. 7
Inhalation of Y. pestis leads to primary pneumonic plague and involves inhalation of large droplets after close contact ( < 1.5 meters) with infected cats or a patient coughing copious amounts of bloody sputum.  The  average  number  of  secondary  cases  per  primary inhalational case is 1.3. 8,9
Ingestion of Y. pestis has been observed after consumption of raw or poorly cooked contaminated food, with contaminated camel meat  and  liver  being  the  most  frequently  reported  source  of food-borne transmission. 7
Human ectoparasitic transmission may be an under-appreciated route of human-to-human transmission that may have played a key  role  during  historical  epidemics. 10 Transmission  by  the anthropophilic |ea Pulex irritans and by the human body louse Pediculus  humanus has  been  suggested  during  familial  cases  of plague, 11 with the latter being supported by experimental evidence. 12

Geographic Distribution of Human Plague
A soil reservoir and the relative resistance of various rodent species may explain why plague regularly re-emerges in long-lasting plague foci in all continents except Antarctica and Oceania (Fig. 77.3). experienced outbreaks of human plague after silent periods of 30 to 50 years: India in 1994, Zambia in 1996, Indonesia in 1997, 584 deaths and 3248 cases have been reported from 2010 to 2015. 13 Plague can therefore be considered a re-emerging disease, mainly contracted during outdoor professional and recreational activities, and after consumption of contaminated food, contrary to what had been observed during the large historic urban outbreaks of that activities with close extended contacts with pet dogs (such as sleeping in the same bed as a pet dog in a plague-endemic area) are signi{cantly associated with plague. 14 In Europe, no human cases have been recently reported, but animal plague is still present along  the  western  banks  of  the  Caspian  Sea.  In  all  geographic areas, a seasonal pattern of human plague is observed, although the  seasonal  pattern  is  different  from  one  geographic  area  to another, even within the same country. 7

Y. pseudotuberculosis (genome size, 4.72 Mb) 15 ; Y. pestis detected in Bronze Age buried individuals. 16  Genome sequencing has identi{ed numerous insertion sequences, evidence of intragenomic recombination and lateral gene transfer, and remnants suggestive of a previous enteric life cycle. A 70- to 75-kb plasmid common to all pathogenic Yersinia species (termed pCD1, pCad, pVW , pYV, or pLcr plasmid ) encodes a type III secretion system (Yops, for ' Yersinia Outer Proteins') and V antigen. A 100- to 110-kb plasmid (termed pFra/Tox, pFra, pTox, pMT1, or pYT plasmid ) encodes the capsular F1 glycoprotein antigen and the Yersinia murine toxin Ymt. A 9.5-kb plasmid (termed pPst, pPla, pPCP1, or pYP plasmid ) encodes the plasminogen activator Pla (which is thought to promote the systemic spread of Y. pestis from peripheral sites) and pesticin, a bacteriocine involved in iron capture in mammalian hosts. 1 Not all  {eld  isolates  harbor  the  three  plasmids,  which  are  unstable during laboratory culture; new plasmids have been characterized, unsurprisingly illustrating the plasticity and ongoing evolution of Y. pestis . 6 Other virulence factors encoded on the chromosome are associated with the lipopol  ysaccharide endotoxin and with  iron uptake-giving the pig  mentation of colonies grown on Congo red medium. Y. pestis is a non-sporulated, aerobic, gram-negative, oxidasenegative, urease-negative, catalase-positive bacillus growing slowly at 28°C, pH 7.4. Biochemical pro{ling distinguishes nine biovars,  which  have  been  proposed  as  sub-species,  including Y.  pestis subsp. pestis and  additional  subspecies angola,  altaica, caucasica, hissarica, quinghaiensis, talassica, ulegeica, and xilingolensis, organisms of unknown pathogenicity isolated from various rodent species in Angola (subspecies angola )

in the so-called bubo, and Y. pestis can further disseminate via the lymphatic and blood vessels to the spleen and liver and can cause a rapidly fatal septicemia, with dissemination in the lung resulting in secondary pneumonic plague and in the meninges and cerebrospinal  |uid  (CSF),  causing  meningitis.  Hematogenous  dissemination of the bacteria to other organs and tissues may cause Y.  pestis rapidly  multiplies  in  human  tissues  because  it  protects itself  from  the human immune system by serum resistance and evasion  from  innate  immune  functions. Y.  pestis is  a  facultative intracellular bacterium that multiplies within macrophages. 17

CLINICAL FEATURES OF PLAGUE
People  of  all  ages  and  both  genders  are  susceptible  to  plague, although recently, most cases have been reported in children with a small predominance for males over the last decade. 7 It remains confers  resistance  to  HIV  infection,  also  confers  resistance  to plague. 19
Bubonic plague is the most frequent clinical form, developing 2 to 10 days after inoculation of Y. pestis . 7 Features include chills; fever; myalgias; arthralgias; weakness; and a painful, tender, swollen, enlarged lymph node referred to as  a bubo draining  the  site  of inoculation (Fig. 77.4). The femoral and inguinal nodes are most frequently  involved  (bubo  is  Greek  for  'groin'),  followed  in frequency by axillary and cervical nodes. Careful examination may reveal local skin in|ammation at the site of the ectoparasite's bite with a papule, pustule, scab, or ulcer. The bubo of plague is clinically distinguishable from enlarged lymph nodes due to other causes by  its  association  with  systemic  signs  of  toxemia  and  its  rapid onset.  Moreover, plague is  the only  cause  of clustered  cases of febrile, enlarged lymph nodes, leading to its unambiguous diagnosis in  this  situation.  Bubonic  plague  usually  rapidly  responds  to appropriate antibiotic therapy,  with the  lymph  node remaining enlarged  and  tender  for  1  week.  If  untreated  with  an  effective antibiotic,  the  patient  will  become  increasingly  toxic  and  will develop a septicemic form of plague, with a mortality risk of 50% to 90%.
Septicemic plague is usually  secondary  to the bubonic form and features  a  rapidly  progressive,  overwhelming toxemia. The patient  may  present  with  gastrointestinal  symptoms,  including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, which may confuse the diagnosis. In the absence of rapid supportive therapy combined with effective antibiotic treatment, septicemic plague is fulminate and fatal.
Pneumonic plague is the most rapidly fatal form; the incubation period for primary pneumonic plague is 1 to 3 days after contact
with a coughing patient. Onset is sudden, with chills, fever, chest pain, cough, dyspnea, and hemoptysis. Case fatality rates exceed

Pharyngitis is a rare form diagnosed in patients who consumed raw or poorly cooked  contaminated  meat,  such  as  camel  meat,  and  features anterior  cervical  lymphadenitis.  Pleuritis,  endophthalmitis,  and myocarditis are exceptional forms of plague.

PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Plague should be considered in any patient returning from,  or living in, a country with active plague epizoonoses who presents with febrile adenitis. In this circumstance, it is useful to rapidly collect whole blood in three successive blood culture bottles, as well as sputum, urine, and lymph node |uid. Lymph node |uid can be sterilely obtained using saline for aspiration. 7 More rarely, CSF could be collected if clinically indicated. Additional environmental specimens may include any ectoparasite found on the patient's body and clothes, as well as specimens from any animal suspected to be a potential source of infection. Clinical and environmental specimens should be handled in a Biosafety Level (BSL) 2 laboratory, but handling and culture of Y. pestis requires a BSL3 laboratory. Plague is usually a reportable and quarantinable disease covered by national and international health regulations.
Point-of-care diagnosis usually involves using a commercially available  dipstick  immunochromatographic  assay  detecting  the F1  capsular  antigen. 20 This  dipstick  assay  has  been  applied  to urine, whole blood, bubo pus, and sputum. It takes a few minutes and exhibits a 98% speci{city and 90% sensitivity for serum and examination of clinical specimens after Gram staining is another technique for the rapid diagnosis of plague and involves detection of gram-negative bacilli exhibiting a characteristic bipolar staining with a 'hairpin appearance' (Fig. 77.5). Polymerase chain reactionbased assays are also available. 21
Isolation  and  culture  of Y.  pestis is  performed  by  incubating cultures at 32°C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 1 to 4 days. Because slow growth is observed on MacConkey agar, other selective media,  including  the  cefsulodin-irgasan-novobiocin  and  beef heart-irgasan-novobiocin agar have been developed. 22 The

identi{cation of Y. pestis can be achieved rapidly using immunochromatographic detection of the F1 antigen on colonies. 23 Rapid identi{cation  using  peptidic  pro{ling  by  mass  spectrometry  is also effective. 24

Antibiotic susceptibility testing should be performed, as a few antibiotic-resistant  strains  have  emerged  in  Madagascar. 25 One strain was resistant to eight antimicrobial agents, including those recommended for therapy (streptomycin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline)  and  prophylaxis  (sulfonamide  and  tetracycline),  as well as ampicillin, kanamycin, and spectinomycin. A second strain was  only  resistant  to  streptomycin.  In  these  strains,  all  of  the resistance genes were carried by conjugative plasmids of approximately 150 kb and 40 kb, respectively. 25 Horizontal gene transfer in the |ea may be the source of antibiotic-resistant Y. pestis strains isolated  from  plague  patients  in  Madagascar. 25 Ampicillin-  and tetracycline-resistant isolates have been identi{ed in |eas and rats in Madagascar, 25 whereas the 150-kd plasmid backbone was shown to be broadly disseminated among multi-drug-resistant zoonotic

pathogens associated with agriculture. 26 Experimental data indicate that Y. pestis strains resistant to |uoroquinolones could be easily selected in the laboratory, but such strains have not been found in the clinical setting.
Typing of Y. pestis is done by testing nitrate reduction, glycerol assimilation, and rhamnose assimilation to determine biotype 17 ; molecular typing can be done by single nucleotide polymorphism analysis, regions of deletion analysis, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats analysis, multiple loci variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) analysis, 17 multi-locus sequence typing, restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and multi-spacer sequence typing analysis. 3 VNTR analysis has proved useful in identifying sources of human exposure. 27

TREATMENT
Rapid administration  of  an  effective  antibiotic  to  patients  with suspected plague is mandatory. Streptomycin, the historical reference antibiotic still used in Madagascar, is no longer available in most countries. Gentamicin alone or in combination with a tetracycline is  an  acceptable substitute 29 (T able  77.1).  Gentamicin and doxycycline were shown to be equivalent in curing patients, except  in terminal-stage  disease. 30 Fluoroquinolones,  as  well  as cephalosporins, are effective in animal models, yet they are not recommended, as, with the exception of a single reported case of plague successfully treated with cipro|oxacin, 7 there are no clinical data  addressing  their  ef{cacy.  Antibiotic  treatment  should  be continued for 10 days. Improvement is clinically evident 2 to 3 days after initiation of antibiotics, although fever may persist for a few more days. Supportive therapy should be undertaken in case of septic shock and septicemic plague.

============================================================
CHUNK 19
============================================================
PREVENTION AND CONTROL
Before exposure to Y. pestis, primary prevention relies on avoiding areas with known epizootic plague; avoiding apparently sick and dead animals; reporting such animals to the health department and avoiding exposure to rats and |eas from diseased rats or other rodents, including use of protective clothes and repellents to avoid exposure to ectoparasites when outdoors; applying insect repellent applying repellents and insecticides to clothes and outer bedding; using gloves for the manipulation of dead animals and carcasses; and cooking meat on an open-|ame grill or on a clam-shell type electric grill. 31
Vaccines  (live  attenuated Y. pestis EV76  strain;  formalininactivated, whole-cell plague; heat-killed whole-cell plague; F1 fraction) can be administrated by aerosol (EV76), subcutaneously (EV76; heat-killed CSL vaccine; CSL Ltd., Victoria, Australia), or  intramuscularly  (formalin-inactivated  Greer  vaccine;  Greer 32 The F1 fraction vaccine appears to have relatively low ef{cacy ( < 60%) and side effects in 35% of vaccinees. There is not enough evidence to evaluate the effectiveness  of  any  plague  vaccine  or  the  relative effectiveness between vaccines and their tolerability. Circumstantial data from observational  studies  suggest  that  killed  vaccines  may  be  more effective  against bubonic plague and have fewer adverse effects than attenuated vaccines. No evidence is available regarding the long-term effects of any plague vaccine and their role in controlling plague outbreaks. 32

============================================================
CHUNK 20
============================================================
PREVENTION AND CONTROL
In the case of potential exposure to Y. pestis, secondary prevention relies  on  the  administration  of  a  tetracycline  or  trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole to people who are bitten by |eas during a local outbreak or who are exposed to tissues or |uids from a plagueinfected animal, people living in a household with a bubonic plague patient (as they may also be exposed to infected |eas), and people in close contact with a person or pet with suspected pneumonic plague. 29 Recent evaluation indicates that doxycycline should be considered a {rst-line antibiotic in the management of bioterrorism agents,  including Y.  pestis . 33 For  a  mass  casualty  situation,  oral therapy with doxycycline, tetracycline, or cipro|oxacin has been recommended, 2 with the latter option being supported by animal models. Prevention of human-to-human transmission from patients with pneumonic plague can be achieved by implementing standard isolation  procedures  until  at  least  4  days  after  the  initiation  of antibiotic treatment.
Control of plague is based on active surveillance of sentinel animals.  In  areas  with  epizootic  outbreaks,  it  is  mandatory  to eliminate food and shelter for rodents around homes, workplaces, and certain recreational areas, such as picnic sites or campgrounds where  people  congregate.  Remove  brush,  rock  piles,  junk,  and food sources, including pet food. Treat pets (cats and dogs) for |ea control regularly. Likewise, the control of a human plague outbreak mainly relies on the rapid con{rmation of the diagnosis and treatment of con{rmed and suspected cases. Killing any human ectoparasite is mandatory during plague outbreaks, as well as killing animal |eas using appropriate and licensed insecticides.
