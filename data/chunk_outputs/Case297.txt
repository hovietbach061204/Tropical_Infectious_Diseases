KEY FEATURES
- Hansen's disease, is a chronic granulomatous bacterial infection principally affecting skin and peripheral nerves. It is caused by Mycobacterium leprae.
- M. leprae, most people will develop adequate protective immunity. Only a small percentage of individuals will develop clinical disease. Patients can present with manifestations that represent a spectrum of disease and host-pathogen interactions, ranging from heavy and diffuse organism loads and minimal host reactions, to pauci-bacillary disease and prominent host immune responses.
- macular hypo-pigmented skin lesion, weakness or pain in the hand because of nerve involvement, facial palsy, acute foot drop, or a painless burn or ulcer in an anesthetic hand or foot. Patients may also present with painful eyes as a {rst indication of lepromatous leprosy. The diagnosis of leprosy should be considered in anyone from an endemic area who presents with typical skin lesions, neuropathic ulcers, or a peripheral neuropathy (sensory loss and/or weakness).
- detection of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in skin smears/ biopsies.
- involves months of treatment.
- phenomena called reactions . These sudden episodes of acute in|ammation are a medical emergency and occur in approximately 30% of leprosy patients. The in|ammation is a result of immune reactions against M. leprae antigens. These immunologic reactions cause neurologic damage that leads to subsequent tissue damage and eventual deformity. Treatment often involves steroids.
- behavioral modi{cations to minimize risk of trauma are important components of the long-term care of individuals with complications of leprosy.
Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease, is a chronic granulomatous bacterial infection principally affecting skin and  peripheral nerves. 1
In  2016,  214,783  new  cases  were  registered  worldwide  and endemic countries are India, Brazil, Indonesia, Ethiopia, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Nepal. 2 Most new cases occur in resourcepoor countries, and leprosy continues to be a signi{cant public health problem and a stigmatizing disease (Fig. 62.1).

THE CAUSATIVE ORGANISM AND HOST RESPONSE
Mycobacterium  leprae is  an  acid-fast,  rod-shaped,  gram-positive organism. It is an obligate intracellular pathogen, and it has not been grown in axenic medium since being identi{ed as the causative organism of leprosy by Armauer Hansen in 1874. It can be harvested after prolonged incubation in the mouse footpad and occurs by natural infection in the nine-banded armadillo, which is a reservoir for the organism in the states of T exas and Louisiana in the United States, where transmission on M. leprae from armadillo to human has been recorded.
In 2001, the genome of M. leprae was sequenced. The organism appears  to  have  undergone  extensive  reductive  evolution  with considerable downsizing of its genome compared with M. tuberculosis. Almost half of the genome is occupied by pseudogenes. 3
Transmission is thought to occur mainly through aerosolized nasal  droplets,  spread  when  coughing  or  sneezing  takes  place. Forty-eight percent of lepromatous patients compared with 3% of borderline patients have nasal discharge containing M. leprae. The number of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in a single nasal blow averaged 1.1 × 10 8 in a study of 17 patients. 4 Contacts of leprosy patients are  at  higher  risk  of  developing  the  disease  than  the  general population.  There  are  case  reports  of  leprosy  occurring  after presumed inoculation through the skin during surgical procedures, tattooing, or accidental trauma. 5 The organism can persist outside the  body  under  various  environmental  conditions  for  up  to 5 months. 6

THE CAUSATIVE ORGANISM AND HOST RESPONSE
After contact with an infective dose of M. leprae, most people will  develop  adequate  protective  immunity  (Fig.  62.2).  Only  a small percentage of individuals will develop clinical disease. Infecting  organisms  are  taken  up  by  histiocytes  in  the  skin  and  by Schwann  cells  in  the  peripheral  nerves.  This  usually  elicits  an in|ammatory response of histiocytes and lymphocytes. The earliest clinical sign is a vague, small, hypo-pigmented macule, described as indeterminate leprosy; over 70% of these heal spontaneously. If  bacillary  growth  outstrips  the  defense  mechanism,  then  the condition  progresses  to  one  of  the  patterns  that  make  up  the spectrum of disease in leprosy. The incubation period can range between 2 and 12 years. In|ammation plays an important role in the  neurologic  damage  that  leads  to  subsequent  tissue  damage and eventual deformity.

DIAGNOSIS OF LEPROSY
The basis of a clinical diagnosis of leprosy is the presence of one of the three cardinal signs:

A patient may present with a macular hypo-pigmented skin lesion  (Fig.  62.3),  weakness  or  pain  in  the  hand  due  to  nerve involvement, facial palsy, acute foot drop, or a painless burn or ulcer  in  an  anesthetic  hand  or  foot.  Patients  may  also  present with  painful  eyes  as  a  {rst  indication  of  lepromatous  leprosy. The diagnosis of leprosy should be considered in anyone from an endemic area who presents with typical skin lesions, neuropathic  ulcers,  or  a  peripheral  neuropathy  (sensory  loss  and/or weakness).

CLASSIFICATION OF LEPROSY
Leprosy may be considered an immunologic disease. Immunity de{nes susceptibility to leprosy, type of clinical leprosy, pathology, and major clinical complications of leprosy. Classi{cation of the disease is  important  to  determine prognosis, patients at higher risk of reactions, and nerve damage, as well as select appropriate treatment. Leprosy patients can be classi{ed using two systems:
The Ridley-Jopling system 9 (Fig. 62.4) uses clinical and histopathologic features and the Bacterial Index. Leprosy manifests in a spectrum of disease forms, ranging from the tuberculoid to the  lepromatous.  The  clinical  manifestations  of  leprosy  are determined by the host's response to the leprosy bacillus: tuberculoid (TT) patients have a strong cell-mediated immune response manifesting as limited clinical disease, granuloma formation, and no detectable mycobacteria; lepromatous (LL) patients have no cell-mediated immunity to M. leprae and have widespread disease and a high bacterial load. Between these two extremes there is a range of variations in host response-these comprise borderline cases (BT, borderline tuberculoid; BB, borderline borderline; BL, borderline lepromatous). Immunologically, borderline cases are

============================================================
CHUNK 6
============================================================
Laboratory Tests
The presence of AFB in skin smear examination or biopsy material examination can provide supporting evidence for the diagnosis. The Bacterial Index gives a measure of bacterial density in the skin  sample  under  examination  on  a  logarithmic  scale  ranging from 0 to 6. Histopathologic evaluation is essential for accurate classi{cation of leprosy lesions and is the best diagnostic test in a well-resourced setting, both for con{rming and excluding the diagnosis of leprosy. Recent advances have been made in serologic diagnostic tests. Antibodies to the M. leprae -speci{c antiphenolic glycolipid (PGL-1) are present in 90% of patients with untreated lepromatous disease, but only 40% to 50% of patients with paucibacillary disease and 1% to 5% of healthy controls. 7  An immunohistochromatographic assay, the ML |ow test, based on PGL-1 detection, has been used in Brazil. 8 The drawback with serologic tests is that they do not detect patients with pauci-bacillary leprosy. Polymerase  chain  reaction  (PCR)  for  detection  of M.  leprae -encoding speci{c genes or repeat sequences is potentially highly sensitive  and  speci{c,  as  it  detects M.  leprae DNA  in  95%  of multi-bacillary and 55% of pauci-bacillary patients. PCR is currently not used in clinical practice. 7

CLINICAL FEATURES
The cardinal signs of leprosy are anesthetic skin lesions, numbness or weakness as a result of damage to sensory and motor nerves, and ulcers or burns in an anesthetic hand or foot.

Over  the  past  20  years,  more  than  15  million  people  have received MDT and have been cured of M. leprae infection. Relapse rates after treatment with MDT vary from 0% to 2.5% in paucibacillary disease. In multi-bacillary disease, the published rates of relapse are between 0% and 7.7%.

REACTIONS
Leprosy is complicated by immunologic phenomena called reactions . These  sudden  episodes  of  acute  in|ammation  are  a  medical emergency and occur in approximately 30% of leprosy patients. The in|ammation is caused by immune reactions against M. leprae antigens. Patients can present in reaction before MDT treatment, and a signi{cant proportion of patients develop reactions within
the {rst 6 months of treatment. However, reactions can also occur after successful MDT treatment and are probably caused by the persistence of M. leprae antigens. Patients may experience repeated reactions  after  treatment,  resulting  in  increased  suffering  and disability. There is also an increase in the incidence of reactions in  postpartum  patients.  These  immunologic  reactions  and  the in|ux of in|ammatory cells cause nerve damage through demyelination. It is this  neurologic damage that leads to subsequent tissue damage and eventual deformity (Fig. 62.6). The early recognition of reactions is important to minimize nerve damage. Reactions place a signi{cant burden on leprosy services.
Reactions require treatment with immune-modulatory drugs. High doses of these agents for prolonged periods are often required, and this may contribute to morbidity. Physicians must be aware of the complications of immune suppression as well as the potential drug  interactions  between  drugs  used  to  treat  reactions  and components  of  MDT.  Patients  prescribed  oral  corticosteroids should be prescribed a gastric acid suppression agent-preferably a  proton  pump  inhibitor.  The  need  for  corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis  prevention  therapy  should  be  assessed  in  each individual.
Two distinct types of leprosy reaction occur: leprosy type 1 reactions (T1Rs, also known as reversal reactions ) and type 2 reactions (also known as erythema nodosum leprosum [ENL]).

============================================================
CHUNK 15
============================================================
Management of Type 1 Reactions
The  clinical  manifestations  of  these  reactions  are  edema  and erythema of skin lesions and neuritis. Acute neuritis (de{ned as spontaneous nerve pain, paresthesia, or tenderness with new sensory or  motor  impairment  of  recent  onset)  may  also  occur  without evidence of skin in|ammation (Fig. 62.7).
Corticosteroids are used to treat moderate and severe reactions, where pain is severe and nerve function impairment (NFI) is present. Prednisolone 40 to 60 mg daily should be started and tapered down after clinical improvement to the minimal effective dose until the reaction subsides. There is no clear consensus on the optimum dose of corticosteroids or the length of treatment, although a recent study has shown that a longer period of treatment (5 months) was more bene{cial than the 3 months often used 15 (T able 62.5). Other agents have been compared with prednisolone in the management of T1Rs. Cyclosporine at a starting dose of 7.5 mg/kg/day showed promise in  a  randomized  study  of  73  individuals  conducted  in

Management of Erythema Nodosum Leprosum Reactions
Type 2 leprosy reactions (i.e., ENL) present as a systemic illness: a  patient  with  ENL  may  be  very  sick  with  high  temperatures; painful subcutaneous nodules; peripheral edema; and in|ammation of the nerves, eyes, joints, muscles, bones, and testes. 20 The onset of ENL is acute, but it may pass into a chronic phase and is often recurrent (see T able 62.5).
For mild ENL, aspirin may be used. Patients with severe ENL require hospitalization and treatment with high-dose prednisolone (starting  at  60 mg). The  ef{cacy  is  variable,  and  some  patients with chronic, or recurrent, ENL may need to take prednisolone for several years. 21 These long, high doses of steroids are associated with steroid side effects, such as hypertension, diabetes, cataracts, and acne. 22 Thalidomide, starting at a dose of 100 to 400 mg daily and tapering down, is the treatment of choice for severe ENL. 23 It controls ENL symptoms rapidly and prevents recurrences, but its availability and teratogenicity limit its use. Other alternatives to prednisolone, such as azathioprine, cyclosporine, pentoxifylline, and methotrexate, are being studied. T reatment with clofazimine improves ENL and is a mild anti-in|ammatory. However, clofazimine therapy does not control severe ENL and takes 4 to 6 be used at 300 mg per day for 12 weeks then reduced to 200 mg for  12  weeks  and  maintained  thereafter  at  100 mg  for  12  to 24 weeks. 24

NFI is de{ned as clinically detectable impairment of motor, sensory, or autonomic nerve function. 25 NFI may occur in the absence of symptoms  and  may  go  unnoticed  by  the  patient  (i.e.,  'silent neuropathy'). NFI is detected clinically by testing the sensation in  the  patient's  hands  and feet  with  graded mono{laments and testing the small muscles' power.
Patients seen with NFI of recent onset (less than 6 months) should be given a course of prednisolone therapy and physiotherapy. Some of these patients will recover function of the affected part.

CHUNK 20
============================================================
Ongoing Management and Prevention of Complications
Education  concerning  factual  information,  such  as  mode  of transmission, infectivity, treatment, and complications, is essential for all patients and health care providers. Patients should be taught self-examination of the hands and feet with early medical review if signs of in|ammation or trauma occur. Adequate footwear or other protective devices should be made available to those with insensitive or deformed feet. Ulcers in anesthetic feet are the most common cause of hospitalization. Ulcers are treated by rest and cleaning, although any signs of osteomyelitis need to be referred for surgical debridement. Appropriate early physiotherapy must be  instituted,  and  patients  must  be  referred  to  the  appropriate specialist for evaluation and correction of deformity. Leprosy still elicits stigma in many communities, and the patient will bene{t from social and psychological support.

============================================================
Chemoprophylaxis and Immunotherapy
To date, no speci{c vaccine has been developed to prevent infection by M.  leprae, although  there  is  good  evidence  that  bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) has protective ef{cacy. A meta-analysis of 26 studies demonstrated an overall protective effect between 26% and 61%. The age at vaccination did not predict the protective effect of BCG. 26
Protecting  household  contacts  of  leprosy  patients  has  been explored by giving them a single dose of rifampin in Bangladesh. However, this intervention only protected against the development of  pauci-bacillary  leprosy  and  not  multi-bacillary  leprosy,  and protection  only  lasted  2  years. This  shows  that  preventing  the development of leprosy is dif{cult. 27

============================================================
CHUNK 22
============================================================
Leprosy and HIV
There  were  concerns  that  an  interaction  between  HIV  and M. leprae infection would result in an increased incidence of leprosy cases.  However,  studies  in  Uganda,  Mali,  Ethiopia,  and  South India  have  not  shown  an  increased  prevalence  of  leprosy  cases associated with HIV infection. 28-30 An association has been found between HIV infection and complications of leprosy. In a casecontrolled study in Uganda, HIV seropositivity was found to be a signi{cant risk factor for developing reactions and neuritis-an unusual {nding because reversal reactions are associated with an increase in CD4 cells. Similarly, Sampaio et al found that HIVinfected  patients  with  low  CD4  counts  had  normal  granuloma formation with numerous CD4 cells. 31 A  Brazilian  study  of  40 patients  with  leprosy  and  HIV  co-infection  demonstrated  that there was no signi{cant difference in the proportion of HIV-positive or -negative patients with T1R. 32
Treatment of a leprosy patient with concurrent HIV infection does not differ from that of a seronegative leprosy patient, and reactions should be managed with corticosteroids or thalidomide as appropriate.
Since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the management of HIV , leprosy is being increasingly reported  as  part  of  the  immune  reconstitution  in|ammatory syndrome (IRIS). 32,33 It is  possible that the immune response to M. leprae in an HIV-infected person is suppressed before starting HAART and that leprosy manifests as IRIS with the sudden reversal of  this  suppression  and  the  rise  of  CD4. 34 Further  studies  are needed to understand the clinical and pathologic features in HIV and leprosy co-infection.

============================================================
CHUNK 23
============================================================
CONCLUSION
Since  the  implementation  of  MDT  in  1982  in  endemic  areas, more than 90% of registered cases have received treatment, 15 million patients have been cured, and global prevalence has declined. The continuation of surveillance and leprosy control programs is essential.
The current treatment for leprosy reactions is still not optimal, with a signi{cant number of patients not responding to prednisolone, and some ENL patients requiring chronic thalidomide therapy. Researchers  are  still  looking  for  different  immunosuppressant drugs with ef{cacy in the treatment of reactions.
The stigma associated with the diagnosis of leprosy is still a very  real  problem,  and  the  management  of  someone  with  the disease should include discussion of their psychosocial status and education for the patient and their family.
