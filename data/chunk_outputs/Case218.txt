INTRODUCTION
Cysticercosis is the infection of human tissues with larvae of the pork tapeworm, Taenia solium. Endemic in most of the world, this parasitic disease is a major cause of seizures and other neurologic morbidity.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Neurocysticercosis  is  estimated  to  be  the  most  common  parasitic infection  of  the  brain  and  the  most  common  cause  of  adult-onset epilepsy worldwide. Cysticercosis is endemic on all continents except Australasia  and  is  common  in  non-Muslim  developing  countries, including much of South and Central America, Asia and Africa. Prevalence  varies  depending  on  the  prevalence  and  type  of  animal husbandry,  hygiene  and  dietary  practices.  In  endemic  countries, approximately 30% of seizure disorders are caused by neurocysticercosis  [1].  Industrialized  porcine  production,  meat  inspection  and sewage disposal has  helped  to  prevent  propagation  of  the  parasite lifecycle in high income countries, but immigration from, and travel to,  endemic  regions  leads  to  sporadic  cases  of  cysticercosis.  For example,  cysticercosis  accounts  for  as  many  as  2%  of  neurologic/ neurosurgical admissions in southern California and immigrant tape-

NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS AND PATHOLOGY
The natural  history  of  cysticercosis  is  poorly  defined  because  most infections are asymptomatic and many of those who are symptomatic have a long prepatent period. Symptomatic cysticercosis is a serious disease  that  can  be  progressive  and  have  fatal  consequences.  In general,  numerous  intracranial  cysticerci  are  associated  with  more severe disease that is less likely to respond to treatment. The location of  cysticerci  is  also  important:  patients  with < 20  cysticerci  with  a parenchymal location and the absence of hydrocephalus have a better prognosis than those who have basal or ventricular lesions, especially if associated with hydrocephalus.
Cysticercosis  is  contracted  when  humans  ingest  material  contaminated  by  human  feces  containing  tapeworm  eggs,  not  from  eating infected pork containing cysticerci; this would lead to gut infection with the tapeworm. When humans ingest tapeworm eggs, they act as  the  intermediate,  dead-end  host  and  develop  cysticerci  within their tissues  in  the same way as pigs (Fig. 127.1). Strict vegetarians and people who have never eaten pork can develop cysticercosis if they ingest fecally-contaminated food items. Humans harboring an

intestinal  tapeworm  can  infect  themselves  (anus-hand-mouth)  or others,  directly  or  through  unhygienic  food  preparation.  Internal autoinfection has been suggested, but is not common. Most patients with cysticercosis do not harbor an adult tapeworm in their intestines at the time of the diagnosis and most people infected with a tapeworm do not develop symptomatic cysticercosis. It is not known what proportion of tapeworm carriers will develop cysticercosis over time.

============================================================

============================================================
NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS AND PATHOLOGY
Living  cysticerci  actively  evade  and  suppress  immune  recognition, especially within immunologically privileged sites, such as the brain and the eyes. Histopathology of live cysts from human tissues shows minimal host inflammation. Only rarely do living cysticerci induce symptoms-usually by causing obstruction to the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by pressure on adjacent tissues. Symptoms most commonly  result  from  inflammation  owing  to  the  host's  immune response to dying cysticerci.  This explains  the  usual  delay  between infection and cyst establishment (which occurs within three months of infection), and the development of symptoms several years later. English  soldiers  returning  from  India  and  remaining  in  the  UK,  a non-endemic area, developed seizures caused by cysticercosis after a median of 3-5 years [3].
Inflammation around the cysticerci can be asymptomatic or lead to acute  symptoms  that  can  be  fatal.  Lymphocytes  and  plasma  cells usually outnumber giant multinuclear cells and foamy macrophages. Eosinophils are conspicuous. Adjacent necrosis and perivascular infiltration of mononuclear lymphoid cells can lead to granuloma, fibrous scar or  calcification. In  the same patient,  cysticerci at different sites may be viable or at various stages of degeneration.
In the CNS, two forms of cysticerci are found. Cysticerci located in the brain parenchyma or floating freely in the ventricles are spherical or ovoid, 5-10-mm structures, each of which contains a scolex (Fig. 127.1).  A  second,  uncommon  form  called  racemose  cysticerci  are large, lobulated vesicular structures that lack a scolex and are usually found  in  the  basal  cisternal  spaces  resembling  a  bunch  of  grapes. Racemose cysticerci  are not usually present in pediatric cases. They may be a degenerative  form or a  response to  a  different anatomic location.

============================================================

============================================================
CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
Although  cysticerci  can  infect  any  tissue,  most  clinically  relevant lesions affect the brain and spinal  cord (neurocysticercosis), or  the eye  (Fig.  127.2A).  Clinical  features  of  cysticercosis  vary  widely, depending on the number, size and location of the larvae, as well as on the stage of evolution and inflammatory response.

============================================================
CHUNK 6
============================================================
NEUROCYSTICERCOSIS
The clinical expression of neurocysticercosis corresponds to whether the parasites are intraparenchymal (within the brain hemispheres or cerebellum)  or  extraparenchymal  (intraventricular  or  subarachnoid lesions).
The most frequent symptom of intraparenchymal cysticercosis is seizures. Focal seizures with secondary generalization are most common, but any type of epilepsy can occur. Single or multiple cysticerci within the  brain  parenchyma  can  be  inflamed  and  surrounded  by  focal encephalitis and edema.
Extraparenchymal NCC is associated with intracranial pressure with or without hydrocephalus. When the subarachnoid space at the base of the brain is affected, basal arachnoiditis is often particularly severe, causing cranial nerve palsies and potentially fatal raised intracranial pressure. Intraventricular or basal cysticercosis is a frequent cause of obstructive  hydrocephalus  in  endemic  regions.  Intermittent,  positional headache may represent a free-floating cysticerci in the fourth ventricle  (Brun's  syndrome). Meningeal  inflammation  around  subarachnoid  cysts  can  cause  vasculitis  and  cerebral  infarcts,  usually when the base of the brain is affected [4].
The encephalitic form occurs predominantly in children and young females and consists of massive infection of the brain (Fig. 127.1).

Lesions are in the same phase of development, and cause an immune reaction  leading  to  severe  brain  edema.  These  patients  have  intracranial  hypertension,  seizures  that  are  difficult  to  control  and  a reduced level of consciousness. Rare clinical forms include dementia or other psychiatric symptoms (often in association with hydrocephalus), or chronic meningitis.

============================================================
CHUNK 7
============================================================
NEUROCYSTICERCOSIS
Spinal cysticercosis, although uncommon, is associated with increased pressure  either  directly  from  the  cysticercus  or  secondary  to  the inflammatory reaction. Spinal  cysticercosis  is  more  frequently  subarachnoid and only rarely intramedullary. Cervical spinal cysticercosis is usually associated with racemose cysticercosis of the posterior fossa.

============================================================
CHUNK 8
============================================================
OPHTHALMIC CYSTICERCOSIS
Cysticerci  infecting  the  eye  are  retinal  or  subretinal,  but  may  float freely in the vitreous or aqueous humors (see Fig. 127.2). Light entering the eye during ophthalmoscopy may induce movement and even envagination of a living parasite. Inflammation around degenerating cysticerci  usually  threatens  vision  by  causing  chorioretinitis,  retinal detachment or vasculitis.

============================================================
CHUNK 9
============================================================
MUSCULAR AND SUBCUTANEOUS CYSTICERCOSIS
Some patients have characteristic subcutaneous cysticerci palpable as pea-like nodules. These are usually asymptomatic, although transient local pain and tenderness can occur as cysticerci degenerate. The frequency of subcutaneous nodules varies considerably by geographic area, with < 5% of patients in South America and > 20% of patients in

Asia having subcutaneous nodules. These lesions are easy to sample by biopsy and can thus provide proof of disease.
Large numbers of cysticerci can infect muscles and rare cases of massive muscular pseudohypertrophy have been reported (Fig. 127.2B). These  patients  can  also  have  many  cysticerci  in  multiple  other localizations.

============================================================
CHUNK 10
============================================================
PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
NCC  should  be  suspected  in  patients  presenting  with  neurologic symptoms and a history of living in, or traveling in, endemic regions, particularly if they have late onset seizures or raised intracranial pressure. Given the variability of clinical manifestations, the diagnosis is based on neuroimaging findings and supported by serology.

============================================================
CHUNK 11
============================================================
HISTORY OF TAENIASIS
Patients  should  be  asked  whether  they  have  passed  tapeworm  segments, even decades previously, and stool specimens should be examined for tapeworm eggs to rule out concurrent intestinal tapeworm infections.  While  in  most  cases,  the  infective  tapeworm  dies  long before the symptoms of NCC develop, it may still be found in approximately  10%  of  NCC  patients.  Younger  individuals,  or  those  with many viable brain parasites, have a higher risk of concurrent taeniasis. The diagnostic yield of standard co-proparasitologic examination is low and the finding of Taenia spp. eggs does not differentiate intestinal Taenia saginata from Taenia solium infections as eggs are morphologically identical. Treatment with an anthelminthic agent causes the worm to be passed in the feces, allowing definitive identification of the  tapeworm  species  (see  Fig.  127.3).  A  tapeworm  co-proantigen detection ELISA assay has much better sensitivity, although it is not widely available [5, 6].

============================================================
CHUNK 12
============================================================
IMAGING
CNS imaging using either CT or MRI is the key tool for the diagnosis of NCC. Living cysticerci are visible as 5-10-mm hypodense lesions that do not enhance with intravenous contrast (Fig. 127.3). Degenerating  cysticerci,  which  are  more  likely  to  be  associated  with  symptoms, are surrounded by edema with ring or nodular enhancement after administration of intravenous contrast. End-stage calcified cysticerci  are  seen  as  hyperdense  lesions.  MRI  provides  more  detailed images  of  living  and  degenerating  cysticerci  (Fig.  127.4).  MRI  frequently demonstrates cysticerci that may not be seen on CT, especially small lesions or those located in the posterior fossa. MRI is better than CT in defining edema and other inflammatory images, but its sensitivity to detect calcifications is lower. Plain radiographs of the thighs or other muscles may reveal calcifications along the fascial planes formed by degenerated cysticerci (see Fig. 127.2B).

============================================================
CHUNK 13
============================================================
SEROLOGY AND CEREBROSPINAL FLUID (CSF) EXAMINATION
Several different types of serologic tests have been used to diagnose cysticercosis. The  enzyme-linked immunoelectrotransfer blot (EITB, western blot) is the assay of choice. It has > 98% sensitivity and specificity,  although  it  has  only  0-80%  sensitivity  for  a  single  ringenhancing  lesion.  This  test  uses  a  group  of  purified  glycoprotein antigens in an immunoblot to detect infection-specific antibodies in serum or CSF. One of its advantages is its equal sensitivity in serum or CSF, so a lumbar puncture is not required. Despite the reliability of this assay, results must be interpreted with caution in patients from endemic areas, where some healthy urban populations and > 10% of rural villagers in pig-raising areas can be seropositive [7]. Patients with clinical symptoms tend to have more specific bands than those who are asymptomatic, and patients with strong reactions to several antibody  bands  have  more  intracranial  lesions  than  those  with  fewer bands.  The  cysticercosis  EITB  has  largely  superseded  less  sensitive ELISA assays.
CSF findings may be normal and, even when abnormal, there are no characteristic features. Moderate CSF pleocytosis and elevated protein concentration can be noted. Eosinophils are found in approximately one quarter  of  patients  with  cysticercosis.  Antigen  detection  ELISA assays, developed in the late 1980s, have been recently revisited. They have  poor  sensitivity  in  intraparenchymal  NCC  but  can  provide  a
useful monitoring tool for follow-up of patients with extraparenchymal disease [8, 9].

============================================================
CHUNK 14
============================================================
BIOPSY
A  search  should  be  made  for  subcutaneous  cysticerci,  excision  or biopsy  of  which  confirms  the  diagnosis  of  cysticercosis.  The  gross biopsy specimen is a white, fluid-filled, semi-opaque bladder typically 5-10 mm in diameter, but rarely up to 70 mm. The bladder contains a solid, 2-mm long larval tapeworm scolex. Microscopic examination reveals four suckers and a double row of hooks on the scolex by which an ingested scolex attaches to the human intestinal wall.

============================================================
CHUNK 15
============================================================
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The  heterogeneous  clinical  features  of  cysticercosis  make  diagnosis difficult, but the combination of imaging and reliable serology greatly facilitates diagnosis. A single ring-enhancing intracranial lesion may present a difficult differential diagnosis, because 20-50% of patients with these lesions can have a negative EITB. Other possible causes are tuberculosis (more common), neoplasm or brain abscess caused by bacteria, fungi or Toxoplasma gondii. In  some cases, differentiating a tuberculoma from a cysticercal granuloma is difficult, often necessitating empiric therapy for tuberculosis [10]. The differential diagnosis of cystic  images  other  than  cysticercosis  are  subarachnoid  or  porencephalic cysts, hydatid cysts and cystic astrocytomas. Intracranial calcifications can also be caused by tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis, tuberous sclerosis and cytomegalovirus. Cysticerci outside the CNS are easier to identify, but subcutaneous cysticerci may be mistaken for subcutaneous lipomas.

============================================================
CHUNK 16
============================================================
TREATMENT
Treatment  of  neurocysticercosis  involves  symptomatic  and  antiparasitic therapies. Symptomatic treatment is a key part of management.  It  includes  analgesics,  anticonvulsants,  anti-inflammatories (mostly steroids) and management of intracranial hypertension when present.  Anticonvulsant  drugs  should  be  administered  as  for  any other cause of epilepsy. Raised intracranial pressure, with or without associated arachnoiditis, usually responds to oral corticosteroids that may be required long-term in cases of persistent intracranial inflammation. Insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt for hydrocephalus can be beneficial in the short-term, but shunt blockage is common when the CSF protein concentration is elevated. Concomitant use of corticosteroids in patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts has been reported to improve prognosis.
Anti-parasitic treatment  of  cysticercosis  involves killing living brain parasites by using albendazole (15 mg/kg/day in two doses, orally for 8-15 days) or praziquantel (50-75mg/kg/day in three doses, orally for 15 days). Treatment of patients with viable or degenerating cysts with anti-parasitic therapy seems to be associated with better seizure evolution [4, 1 1, 12].
Albendazole is currently the drug of choice because of slightly greater efficacy,  better  availability  and  lower  cost.  A  short  course  of  three doses of 75-100 mg/kg of praziquantel in the same day (every two hours) has been reported to be efficacious in patients with one or two cysts. Between the second and the fifth days of anti-cysticercal therapy, patients usually have an exacerbation of neurologic symptoms attributed to local inflammation as a result of the death of the larvae. For this reason, albendazole or praziquantel should be given under hospital  conditions, usually with  corticosteroids to control edema and intracranial hypertension. Co-administration of corticosteroids reduces the blood levels of praziquantel; however, this is not thought to be clinically relevant.

============================================================
CHUNK 17
============================================================
PERILESIONAL EDEMA AROUND CALCIFIED CYSTICERCI
In approximately 50% of patients with seizures associated only with calcified lesions (without viable parasites), an area of pericalcification edema appears on MRI taken a few days after a seizure. This resolves spontaneously in the following weeks and should not be interpreted as  representing  survival  of  parasites,  but  most  likely  represents  an inflammatory reaction around parasite debris and/or edema associated with seizure activity [13, 14].

============================================================
CHUNK 18
============================================================
PEDIATRIC CYSTICERCOSIS
Pediatric cases are usually found in older children or young teenagers with  recent  onset  seizures  and  a  single  degenerating  cyst.  Rarely, massive infections present with headache and intracranial hypertension. Diagnostic and therapeutic considerations are similar to those for adults.

============================================================
CHUNK 19
============================================================
ASYMPTOMATIC NEUROCYSTICERCOSIS
In  most  cases,  viable  cysticerci  living  within  the  human  brain  are asymptomatic, but they may occasionally be discovered by imaging studies performed for other reasons. If the cysticerci are not causing symptoms and are not associated with radiologic evidence of inflammation, the parasites  may be assumed to be alive  and successfully evading immune-mediated inflammation. There are no data on the benefits of anti-parasitic treatment of asymptomatic cysticercosis. In such  cases,  cestocidal  treatment  would  kill  the  parasites  and  allow prophylactic or therapeutic administration of corticosteroids if treatment caused symptoms. However, cysticerci infecting the brain often resolve without symptoms; thus, an alternative choice is not to treat, but to advise patients to seek medical help if neurologic symptoms develop.

============================================================
CHUNK 20
============================================================
OPHTHALMIC CYSTICERCOSIS
The inflammation associated with a degenerating intraocular cysticercus  may  result  in  permanent  loss  of  vision.  Reports  of  successful treatment with cestocidal drugs, cryotherapy and photocoagulation await  further  confirmatory  studies.  Ocular  cysticercosis  is  usually treated surgically. Excision of a living cysticercus before the onset of significant intraocular inflammation has a good prognosis.

============================================================
CHUNK 21
============================================================
MUSCULAR AND SUBCUTANEOUS CYSTICERCOSIS
Asymptomatic  subcutaneous  or  intramuscular  cysticerci  do  not require treatment, but imaging studies should be performed to preclude the presence of neurologic infection. Cysticerci causing symptoms through local pressure may be excised or treated with cestocidal drugs.  Transient  symptomatic  inflammation  around  degenerating cysticerci is  ameliorated  by  corticosteroid  or  nonsteroidal  antiinflammatory drugs.

============================================================
CHUNK 22
============================================================
PREVENTION AND CONTROL
Transmission of cysticercosis depends on the presence of tapeworm carriers. Human infection with intestinal tapeworms is prevented by freezing or adequate cooking of cysticercotic (measly) pork. In contrast, human cysticercosis results from fecal-oral contamination with material containing T. solium eggs, and basic hygiene and sanitation prevent this disease [15, 16].
