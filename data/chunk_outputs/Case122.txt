INTRODUCTION
Globally, acute respiratory illnesses caused by viruses and bacteria are the most frequently occurring illnesses in all age groups. Disease is mostly limited to the upper airways and is self-limiting, but a small percentage can progress to lower respiratory tract infections as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Children and elderly people are at increased risk, especially in developing countries. Childhood pneumonia is the leading single cause of mortality in children aged less than 5 years. The incidence in this age group is estimated to be 0.29 episodes per child-years in developing countries and 0.05 episodes per child-years in developed countries. This translates into about 156 million new episodes each year worldwide, of which 151 million episodes are in the developing world. Pneumonia is responsible for about 19% of all deaths in children aged less than 5 years, of which more than 70% take place in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. On the other side of the age spectrum, pneumonia is also a major cause of morbidity and  mortality  in  older  people,  with  an  annual  incidence  for  noninstitutionalized patients estimated at between 25 and 44 per 1000 population - up to four times that of patients younger than 65 years of age.
The most important etiologic agents of severe lower respiratory illness are bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae , and viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus. Viruses are more important in mild upper and middle respiratory tract infections and in bronchiolitis in children, whereas bacteria are the main cause of pneumonia, especially in adults. Clinical syndromes  considerably  overlap  and  there  is  increasing  evidence  of bacterial-viral  co-infections  and  of  bacterial  pneumonia  being  secondary to a viral respiratory tract infection [1-4].
A wide range of viruses from different families can cause respiratory infections; the most important are the ortho- and paramyxoviridae,

picornaviridae,  coronaviruses  and  adenoviruses.  Recent  etiological studies  from  tropical  and  subtropical  regions  are  summarized  in Table 29-1 [5-13].

EPIDEMIOLOGY
With  some  notable  exceptions  described  below,  most  respiratory viruses are spread from person-to-person by the respiratory route - to a  varying  extent  by  large  droplets,  small-particle  aerosols  and  by fomites with hand contamination and subsequent self-inoculation. Patients are most infectious early in disease: at symptom onset or even before. Secondary attack rates may be especially high in semi-closed populations,  for  example  among  schoolchildren,  inpatients  and nursing  home  residents.  Children  play  a  major  role  in  respiratory virus  outbreaks  among  families  and  communities.  Frequent  handwashing and covering of the mouth when coughing or sneezing may partially prevent transmission.
Many of the viruses display significant seasonal variation, especially in temperate regions. Influenza virus and RSV epidemics occur in the winter months in temperate regions. In tropical areas, seasonal patterns  are  less  clear:  viruses  may  circulate  throughout  the  year  and peaks may coincide with either lower temperatures or increased rainfall. Parainfluenza virus 3 causes epidemics in the spring, while viruses 1 and 2 do so in autumn and early winter in temperate regions [14].

ORTHOMYXOVIRIDAE: INFLUENZA A, B AND C VIRUSES
Orthomyxoviridae are divided into three genera: A, B and C. Influenza A  viruses  are  further  subtyped  based  on  the  two  major  antigens: hemagglutinin (HA; H1-H16), responsible for host receptor binding/ cell entry; and neuraminidase (NA; N1-N9), responsible for cleavage of  the  HA-receptor  complex  to  release  newly  formed  viruses.  Key amino acids in these proteins, particularly in HA, are associated with host specificity and transmissibility in humans. Aquatic birds are the natural  reservoir  of  influenza A viruses, harboring  all  possible  subtypes.  A  selection  of  subtypes  has  established  endemicity  among  a range of land and water mammals (e.g. humans, pigs, horses, seals; Fig. 29.1). Influenza B and C viruses are mainly human pathogens, with rare reports  of influenza B  virus infection in dogs, cats, swine and seals. Influenza C rarely causes human infections and will not be further discussed.
Yearly epidemics of influenza are caused by influenza A and B viruses with mutations in the regions of the HA and NA genes that encode antigenicity,  allowing  them  to  escape  the  hosts'  immunity  against parent strains (antigenic drift).
New lineages of influenza A virus emerge every few decades, resulting in global  pandemics with varying severity owing to the absence of immunity  in  the  human  population.  New  human  viruses  have emerged  through  re-assortment  of  gene  segments  in  animal  hosts infected with two different viruses (antigenic shift - 1918 Spanish flu: H1N1;  40-100  million  deaths,  1957  Asian  flu:  H2N2;  2  million deaths and 1968 Hong Kong flu: H3N2; 500,000 deaths) [19].

such an introduction, the new virus becomes the dominant circulating  lineage  of  influenza  A.  One  exception  was  the  re-introduction of  H1N1  in  the  human  population  in  1977,  which  was  possibly caused by an escape from a research laboratory. Since 1977, two lineages of H1N1 and H3N2 influenza A viruses have been co-circulating among  humans,  causing yearly seasonal epidemics worldwide (Fig. 29.2). Influenza B viruses co-circulate with influenza A viruses and also cause yearly epidemics but have not been associated with pandemics.
In 2009, a novel lineage of H1N1 influenza A virus emerged, most likely from pigs, in North America and caused a worldwide pandemic of relatively mild influenza. At the time of writing, the pandemic has passed  and  around  18,000  people  died  from  infection  during  the pandemic phase. The virus has now become established as a seasonal virus, has largely replaced the former H1N1 virus and is co-circulating with H3N2.
Sporadic, dead-end human infections of animal viruses are known to occur and have caused concern about the pandemic potential of these viruses. H7N7, H7N3 and H9N2 viruses have caused conjunctivitis and mild, flu-like illness in patients who were in close contact with infected birds or seals. In contrast, H5N1 avian influenza viruses have caused severe human respiratory illness in Asia and North Africa, with a mortality of over 50%. Highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses were first detected  in  birds  in  1996  in  China.  Transmission  to  18  humans

occurred in Hong Kong, six of which were fatal. During the next 6 years, no human or animal cases were recorded. In 2003, the virus re-emerged  in  China.  Since  then,  it  has  become  panzootic  among poultry and wild birds and, at the time of writing, has caused 584 sporadic infections (345 fatal) in humans, most of whom reported close contact with wild birds or domestic poultry. Despite their worldwide presence for many years, and the huge human-animal interface in  Asia,  no  efficient  human-to-human  transmission  episodes  have been recorded. The possibility of mutations or re-assortment in these viruses remains a cause for concern and warrants continuous monitoring and surveillance of H5N1 viruses [15].

PARAMYXOVIRIDAE: RESPIRATORY SYNCYTIAL VIRUS (RSV), PARAINFLUENZA VIRUS 1-4 AND HUMAN METAPNEUMOVIRUS (HMPV)
These six human viruses are the most important causes of lower respiratory tract infections in children worldwide. RSV is the single most important cause of bronchiolitis and the leading cause of respiratory tract infections requiring hospitalization. Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) causes similar, but less frequent, disease, whereas the parainfluenza viruses are associated with croup.
Infections  with  these  viruses  are  very  common  and  virtually  all children will have been infected with RSV by 2 years of age and by hMPV at 5 years of age. Immunity against all viruses is incomplete, although re-infections tend to be milder. Severe disease is common from RSV and hMPV in the first year of life. Re-infection with RSV or parainfluenza  viruses  is  also  a  common  cause  of  pneumonia  in elderly and immunocompromised patients [6]. Other paramyxoviridae, such as rubeola virus (measles) or the zoonotic nipah virus may also  be  associated  with  respiratory  disease  as  part  of  disseminated infection. These are discussed in separate chapters.

CORONAVIRUSES AND SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME (SARS)-CORONAVIRUS
The four main human respiratory coronaviruses (229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1) are associated with relatively mild upper respiratory infections and may cause 10-25% of episodes of common colds, but are less frequently implicated in severe infections requiring hospitalization.
In 2002-2003, a novel, severe form of pneumonia of unknown etiology  emerged  in  Guangdong,  China  and  was  named  Severe  Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). After smoldering for several months, the disease then spread rapidly across the world, facilitated by international  air  travel  and  a  few  so-called  'super-spreaders',  with  the most  notable  outbreaks  in  Hong  Kong  and  Toronto.  Twenty-one percent of affected cases were healthcare workers. The rapidly identified culprit, SARS coronavirus, is thought to have jumped to humans from Civet cats (considered a delicacy in Asia) in live animal markets in Guangdong. Wild civet cats, however, do not carry these viruses but certain bat species have been implicated as the natural reservoir. The epidemic of SARS, with 8096 cases and 744 deaths in 29 countries across 5 continents, started in November 2002 and came to an end in  July  2003.  Few  sporadic  community-  and  laboratory-acquired infections,  including  limited  person-to-person  transmission,  have been recorded since. SARS was characterized by fever and myalgia, rapidly progressing to a respiratory syndrome of cough and dyspnea followed by acute respiratory distress syndrome. Mortality was significantly lower in children.
SARS is primarily spread by the respiratory route, but oral-fecal transmission has also been implicated. Why the SARS epidemic did not continue to spread is subject to much speculation. Explanations may include the fact that SARS is most infectious in a later stage of infection, allowing for timely containment, and an extraordinary worldwide public health effort to control spread [16].

PICORNAVIRUSES: RHINOVIRUSES, ENTEROVIRUSES AND PARECHOVIRUSES
Rhinoviruses are the most important cause of the common cold and may be associated with exacerbations of asthma and chronic bronchitis. Enterovirus and parechoviruses typically present with aseptic meningitis but are also associated with (mild) respiratory illness.

ADENOVIRUSES
Adenoviruses are a frequent cause of epidemic infective conjunctivitis in developing countries and of respiratory tract infections in children and young  adults  worldwide.  Outbreaks  can  occur  in  closed  communities such as day care centers and boarding schools, and among military recruits. Most adenoviral infections remain subclinical.

CHUNK 16
============================================================
NATURAL HISTORY AND PATHOGENESIS
Acute respiratory viral infections usually start in the upper respiratory tract as the  port of entry is the  nose, mouth or eyes. Spread  to the lower parts of the airways occurs within two to four days. Syndromes overlap considerably, are usually accompanied by symptoms such as fever, cough and malaise, and can be caused by any of the pathogens described above.
In  developing countries in  particular, crowding  of large  families in small houses, low levels of sanitation and personal hygiene, indoor and  outdoor  smoke  pollution,  malnutrition,  vitamin  and  mineral deficiencies, and a high frequency of respiratory infections may have detrimental effects on the integrity of the respiratory mucosa, respiratory function and the immune status, making the patient more prone to repeated, and more severe, viral infection and to secondary bacterial  infection.  Old  and  very  young  age,  including  prematurity  are additional risk factors for a more severe course.

============================================================
CHUNK 17
============================================================
Common Cold
The common cold, or coryza, is the most frequent disease worldwide. Specific symptoms include a runny or stuffed nose, sneezing and sore throat. Picorna- and coronaviruses are often involved. Symptoms are caused by local infection of the ciliated nasal mucosal epithelium cells and surrounding increased vascular permeability. Disease is usually self-limiting.

============================================================
CHUNK 18
============================================================
Pharyngitis
Sore  throat  often  accompanies  the  common  cold  but  is  typically not the result of inflammation of the throat, rather it is caused by excretion  of  chemical  inflammation  mediators  that  stimulate  pain nerve endings. Bacteria are a common cause of true pharyngitis, as are  coxsackieviruses,  Epstein-Barr  virus  (EBV)  and  cytomegalovirus (CMV).

============================================================
CHUNK 19
============================================================
Acute Laryngotracheobronchitis (Croup)
Croup affects children under the age of 3 years; the hallmark symptoms are a barking cough and acute inspiratory stridor. Symptoms are caused by localized subglottic  inflammation and edema leading to airflow impediment.

============================================================
CHUNK 20
============================================================
Tracheitis and Tracheobronchitis
These are most often caused by infection of the tracheal and bronchial epithelium  by  influenza  A  and  B  viruses  and  are  characterized  by tracheal tenderness, substernal discomfort on inhalation and nonproductive cough.

============================================================
CHUNK 21
============================================================
Bronchiolitis
This is a distinct syndrome of infants and young children. The major symptom is wheezing, accompanied by flaring of the nostrils, use of accessory  respiratory  muscles  and  cyanosis  in  more  severe  cases. Direct viral infection of the bronchiolar epithelial cells, followed by necrosis, infiltration of lymphocytes, submucosal  swelling  and increased mucus secretion results in the formation of dense plugs of debris that cause impediment of airflow, particularly expiratory. Children  may  experience  repeated  episodes  of  wheezing  after  recovery from  bronchiolitis.  Associations  with  later  development  of  asthma and a causative role of the immune system in pathogenesis of bronchiolitis have been suggested.

============================================================
CHUNK 22
============================================================
Viral Pneumonia
Development of primary viral pneumonia, as described for influenza virus, is defined by dysfunctional gas exchange accompanying inflammation  of  the  lung  parenchyma,  usually  resulting  in  radiographic changes. There is acute generalized illness and a dry cough, rhinitis and conjunctivitis may be present. An increased respiratory rate is an early feature, with cyanosis developing in very severe disease. Viruses reach the small airways either through continuous spread or by inhalation of aerosols. Mucosal infection leads to destruction of epithelial cells, submucosal hyperemia, edema of the airways and hemorrhaging. Additional cellular infiltration and fibrin depositions may further compromise respiratory volume and gas exchange surface [17]. Viral pneumonia can be part of severe forms of measles and varicella, and may  be  secondary  to  generalized  infections  with  EBV  or  CMV.  In infections with New World hantaviruses, pulmonary symptoms are dominant  but  are,  instead,  caused  by  immune-mediated  capillary leak.
Secondary  bacterial  pneumonia  may  follow  any  respiratory  viral illness and presents as a recurrence or protracted fever and respiratory symptoms after initial recovery. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus are common causes.

DIAGNOSIS
Epidemiologic  characteristics,  patient  history,  clinical  features  and accompanying  signs  and  symptoms  may  give  important  clues  in establishing  the  diagnosis  of  specific  viral  agents,  but  clinical  syndromes overlap and are nonspecific. Diagnosis can only be reliably made by detection of virus, antigens or nucleic acids in respiratory or other specimens.
Rapid antigen tests exist for RSV and influenza virus, but these are, in general, not very sensitive (up to 70%). Viral culture is still considered  the  gold  standard,  but  is  complicated,  cumbersome,  slow and  can  also  lack  sensitivity.  Instead,  (reverse  transcriptase)-PCR assays are rapid and sensitive and, when used in multiplex format, can  detect  most  common  respiratory  viruses.  Unfortunately,  they are  expensive  by  themselves  and  require  even  more  expensive equipment, laboratory infrastructure and well-trained staff to be performed  adequately,  limiting  their  application  in  developing  countries [17].
The identification of one viral agent does not rule out a double infection or mixed bacterial-viral infection. Recently, several novel viruses have been identified in the human respiratory tract (Bocavirus, WU and  KI  polyomaviruses,  amongst  several  others).  The  exact  significance  of  the  role  of  these  viruses  as  pathogens  has  yet  to  be established.

PREVENTION AND TREATMENT
Vaccines against influenza virus containing inactivated forms of the at-that-time predominant lineages of H3N2, H1N1 and B viruses are produced twice a year for the northern and southern hemispheres. Use in developing countries is limited because of the high cost and the need for annual re-vaccination. Vaccines for the other respiratory viruses are currently not available. Earlier attempts at the production of a formaldehyde-inactivated RSV vaccine were associated with more severe forms of disease in vaccinees.
Cidofovir  is  available  for  severe  adenovirus  infections  but  causes severe side effects and needs to be administered simultaneously with probenecid. Oral or aerosolized formulations of the broad-spectrum antiviral  ribavirin  inhibit  replication  of  several  respiratory  viruses, including  influenza  virus  and  RSV;  however,  they  are  expensive, studies have not shown consistent benefit for patients with severe RSV infection and they should not be used routinely. Use of ribavirin in combination with other specific anti-influenza drugs for treatment of severe influenza infection has shown promising in vitro effects and is under investigation in vivo .  Humanized anti-RSV immunoglobulins (palivizumab)  are  available  for  the  prevention  of  RSV  infection  in high-risk groups (neonates and infants with congenital heart or lung disease),  but  are  very  expensive.  Pleconaril  was  developed  for  the common  cold  and  inhibits  picornavirus  replication,  but  the  risks (reduction  of  efficacy  of  some  hormonal  contraceptives  and  drugs used to treat HIV) outweighed the benefits for its use in the prevention and treatment of uncomplicated infections.

PREVENTION AND TREATMENT
The adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) and the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir) are specific antiviral drugs for influenza. The adamantanes and oseltamivir are available as oral preparations;  zanamivir  is  administered  through  inhalation.  Both have  shown  benefit  in the  prevention  and treatment  of  uncomplicated influenza, especially when given early in the disease. For severe forms of influenza or H5N1 infection, treatment with oseltamivir is also of benefit when initiated in a later stage. The role of concomitant steroids for these infections is unclear. Oseltamivir was widely used in the developed world and, to a lesser extent, in the developing world to treat infection with 2009 H1N1. Development of resistance during treatment for both classes of drugs is a common phenomenon and is  more frequently observed in children. In addition, the dominant lineages of H3N2 and H1N1 in the 2007-2008 season were resistant against adamantanes and oseltamivir, respectively. Resistance against zanamivir is rare, but its route of administration limits use in severe disease.
Parenteral formulations of oseltamivir and zanamivir, and two new neuraminidase  inhibitors  (peramivir  and  laninamivir)  are  under investigation for the treatment of severe influenza. Convalescent plasmatherapy, monoclonal antibodies and other forms of immunomodulation have shown promising results, warranting further evaluation in clinical trials. Supportive and, if needed, intensive care and various forms of oxygen supplementation for severe respiratory distress (tachypnea, retractions, cyanosis) are often the mainstay of treatment of respiratory  viral  infections.  Extracorporeal  membrane  oxygenation (ECMO) is  a  last  resort  for  maintaining  oxygen  saturation  during severe viral pneumonia.
In some parts of the world (especially Southeast Asia), antibiotics are extensively used to treat any form of mild respiratory illness. Although there  may  be  some  benefit  of  the  use  of  antibiotics  in  preventing secondary bacterial infection, over-the-counter availability of antibiotics,  self-medication  or  medication  by  untrained  pharmacy  workers should  be  discouraged  because  of  the  selection  and  subsequent spread of resistance in commensal oral and gut flora.
