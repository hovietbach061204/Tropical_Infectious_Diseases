Key features
- Trichomoniasis (synonym: 'trich') is a common sexually transmitted disease caused by a protozoan parasite that infects the urogenital tract of men and women
- The vagina is the most common site of infection in women
- Most women present with vaginal discharge, often yellow or green, often frothy; vulvovaginal irritation; and external dysuria
- The urethra is the most common site of infection in men
- Most men with trichomoniasis do not have signs or symptoms; however, some men may temporarily have an irritation inside the penis, mild discharge, or slight burning after urination or ejaculation

INTRODUCTION
Trichomoniasis is a common, worldwide, urogenital infection with Trichomonas vaginalis [1]. The protozoan was first described in purulent genital secretions by Donné  in 1836. Trichomoniasis is a frequent cause of symptomatic vaginitis and a less common cause of nongonococcal urethritis (NGU).

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Trichomoniasis is sexually transmitted by penile-vaginal coitus. The organism is not acquired by fellatio, cunnilingus, or insertive or receptive anal intercourse. Because it is sexually transmitted, it is common in populations at higher risk for other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Its presence in an individual is a marker for high-risk behaviors, and coincident STIs should be sought. Sexual partners, even if asymptomatic,  should  be  treated  simultaneously.  The  presence  of trichomoniasis increases the risk of acquisition of HIV infection [2]. Women who deliver while infected rarely transmit the infection to the neonate, in whom it may present vaginally or, rarely, in the respiratory tract.
For many years, it has been estimated that there are 3-5 million new cases annually in the US and an overall prevalence among women of about 3% [3]. The incidence and prevalence appear higher among African-American women and, not surprisingly, among commercial sex-workers. Infection is detected in about three-quarters of the male sexual partners of infected women [4], and re-infection is common [5].  Nonvenereal  acquisition  by  adults  is  very  rare.  Cure  rates  are demonstrably improved if sexual partners are treated simultaneously. Some estimates suggest that the incidence of trichomoniasis in the US may have gradually decreased over the last 40 years. This may be

due to the large amount of metronidazole and other imidazoles used in the same population for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
Although usually carried asymptomatically by men, T. vaginalis may cause between 7% and 22% of cases of NGU in some populations [6].  Some  studies  suggest  that  male  circumcision  may  reduce  the likelihood of transmission [7].

NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
Infected  vaginal  discharge  contains  10 1 to10 5 organisms/mL,  with symptomatic  women  generally  manifesting  the  larger  numbers. T. vaginalis damages squamous epithelial  cells through  direct  contact, and the process results in microulcerations and microscopic hemorrhages of the vaginal walls and exocervix. Columnar epithelium is not affected, and thus trichomoniasis presents with vaginitis but not with endocervicitis.  The  simultaneous  presence  of  an  endocervical  discharge should alert the clinician to the possibility of coincident infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis . Invasion of tissue does not occur.
T.  vaginalis is  isolated  from  the  urethra  in  most  infected  women. Organisms can cause ulcerations beneath the prepuce [6].
The  immune  response  to  trichomonal  infection  remains  incompletely defined. Infection elicits an outpouring of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), which are easily visualized on wet mount and serve as an aid in differential diagnosis. The presence of many PMNs may  actually  contribute  to  pathogenesis.  A  low-grade  humoral response is detected in serum and vaginal secretion, but immunity to re-infection is not produced.

HISTORY
In various series, 50% to 90% of women with trichomoniasis have symptoms.  Individual  symptoms  are  relatively  nonspecific.  Many women with trichomoniasis have other STIs, and it is sometimes difficult  to  attribute  specific  clinical  features  to  trichomoniasis  alone. Vaginal discharge is recognized by 50% to 75% of infected women, but  the  discharge  is  considered  malodorous  by  only  10%.  Onequarter to one-half of infected women suffer vulvar irritation or pruritus, and up to 50% suffer dyspareunia. Dysuria may be internal or external.
Lower abdominal discomfort is described by only 10% of women, and its presence, particularly if accompanied by an adnexal tenderness on bimanual examination, should suggest the possibility of coincident salpingitis from other pathogens.
Some  women  report  that  symptoms  began  or  were  exacerbated immediately  following  the  menstrual  period.  In  experimentally induced infection, incubation periods ranged from 3 to 28 days.
Most infected men come to treatment as sexual contacts of infected women. T.  vaginalis causes  a  minority  of  cases  of  nongonococcal urethritis,  presenting as  some combination  of  dysuria  and  urethral discharge,  and resembling  NGU  of  more  common  etiologies. Trichomonal urethritis is usually recognized when the condition fails to  respond  to  standard  antibacterial  therapies  [6,8].  Rarely,  epididymitis is encountered, and the organism has been identified in the prostate [6].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
The  vulva  is  erythematous  in  less  than  one-third  of  patients.  On speculum examination, excessive discharge is noted in 50% to 75% of infected women. A yellow vaginal discharge suggests trichomoniasis, but the classically yellow or green, frothy discharge is seen in only a minority of patients. Indeed, bubbles are present in only 8% to 50% of  infected  women  in  various  series,  and  since  bubbles  are  also observed in bacterial vaginosis, their presence is nonspecific [9].
Vaginal wall erythema, occasionally with edema, is observed in 20% to  75%  of  cases,  and  punctate  hemorrhages  are  observed  on  the vaginal  walls  or  the  exocervix  (strawberry  cervix)  in  about  2%  of women during routine physical examination, but the  characteristic hemorrhages are visualized in 45% by colposcopy.
In my experience, mild adnexal tenderness is occasionally elicited on bimanual examination. This may be due to pelvic adenitis induced by the infection, but its presence should raise concerns for coincident salpingitis.

COMPLICATIONS
Trichomoniasis is generally a benign disease. Gestational trichomoniasis has been associated with premature rupture of the fetal membranes and preterm delivery [10]. Unfortunately, two studies suggest that treating trichomoniasis in pregnancy is actually associated with an increased frequency of these complications [1 1,12]. Symptomatic infections require treatment, but some specialists recommend postponing treatment of asymptomatic trichomoniasis in pregnancy until after the 37th week of gestation [13].
Trichomoniasis,  with  its  brisk  inflammatory  response  and  microulcerations of the genital epithelium, may increase the risk of acquiring  HIV  [2].  In  addition,  treatment  of  trichomoniasis  reduces  the concentration of HIV in vaginal secretions about fourfold, theoretically reducing the risk of transmitting the HIV [14].
A  possible  association  of  trichomoniasis  with  pelvic  inflammatory disease and cervical cancer is sometimes hypothesized, but observations  may  be  confounded  by  frequent  past  or  present  co-infection with other sexually transmitted agents, such as chlamydia or human papillomavirus, more strongly associated with upper tract disease and genital malignancy.

PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Clinicians  often  manage  symptomatic  women  who  present  with some combination of vaginal discharge, vulvar irritation, and odor. The clinical and laboratory features that assist in differentiating trichomoniasis from bacterial vaginosis and candidiasis are presented in Table 95-1. A history of contact with a new partner supports the diagnosis of sexually transmitted vaginitis. Odor without much irritation is more consistent with bacterial vaginosis than with trichomoniasis, in  which irritation  is more prominent. After completing the physical  examination,  it  is  useful  to  determine  the  pH  of  vaginal secretions. This is conveniently accomplished by inserting a strip of indicator paper into the vaginal discharge pooled in the lower lip of the speculum. Normal vaginal pH of 4.7 or less is maintained in most patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis. Vaginal pH is elevated above 4.7 in most women with trichomoniasis, but an elevated pH is also found in most women with bacterial vaginosis and is not specific. The pH of vaginal material may be artifactually elevated if contaminated with cervical discharge or semen. After the pH has been determined, several drops of 10% to 20% potassium hydroxide should be added to the discharge in the speculum. The clinician then seeks the elaboration of a pungent, fishy, amine-like odor. This positive result of the whiff test is manifested by 75% of women with trichomoniasis but also by most women with bacterial vaginosis. The whiff test is not positive in vulvovaginal candidiasis. Such point-of-care testing is particularly useful in resource-poor venues [15].
Definitive  diagnosis  is  based  on  demonstrating  the  parasite  (Fig. 95.1). A swab of vaginal material can be agitated in about 1 mL of saline and a drop transferred to a microscope slide to which a coverslip  is  then  applied.  This  wet  mount  is  observed  at  400 × with  the substage condenser racked down and the substage diaphragm closed. Its sensitivity for trichomoniasis is only about 60%. T. vaginalis culture systems are commercially available but expensive. Diagnosis in men is difficult and depends on newer molecular techniques [16]. The Pap smear can detect trichomonal infection, but the Gram stain is useless.

TREATMENT
Decades  of  experience  and  old  studies  confirm  the  value  of  oral 5 ′ -nitroimidazoles  for  treating  men  and  women.  Metronidazole or tinidazole are preferred in  the US, but in  other parts of the world, ornidazole and nimorazole are used as well. High-dose vaginal suppositories  are available  in some  areas, but low-dose metronidazole vaginal preparations designed for bacterial vaginosis are inadequate for trichomoniasis. Male partners should be treated simultaneously even if asymptomatic. Treatment of trichomoniasis can be effectively accomplished with metronidazole 2 g orally in a single dose, tinidazole 2 g orally in a single dose, or metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days. Metronidazole can be used in pregnancy (Category B),  but  tinidazole  (Category  C)  should  not  [13,17].  The  optimal management of patient allergy or trichomonal resistance to the imidazoles remains incompletely defined.
