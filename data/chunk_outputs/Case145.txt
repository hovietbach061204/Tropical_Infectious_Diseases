Key features
- A rare ulcerative sexually transmitted infection caused by intracellular Klebsiella granulomatis
- Encountered mainly in Papua New Guinea, India, South Africa, and South America
- Usually manifests as beefy red genital ulcers or inguinal lesions erupting through overlying skin
- Complications include lymphedema, internal spread in women and, rarely, hematogenous dissemination
- Diagnosed by clinical recognition or by detection of intracellular Donovan bodies with closed safety-pin appearance on smears of ulcer )uid on biopsy
- Treatment usually involves azithromycin; or possibly doxycycline, )uoroquinolone, or ceftriaxone

INTRODUCTION
Granuloma inguinale (donovanosis) is the sexually transmitted infection with the most clearly tropical geographical distribution. The first published case series came from British Guiana in 1876. Recognition of the hallmark diagnostic sign of intracellular inclusion (Donovan) bodies was made independently in India (Donovan), Surinam (Flu), and German New Guinea (Siebert). The causative organism was first isolated in chick yolk-sac by Anderson in 1942. Recent work has led to reclassification of the organism as Klebsiella granulomatis [1].

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Most recent  published  research  on  granuloma  inguinale  has  come from India, Australia, and South Africa. In all of these countries, the disease is  in  decline  and in  Australia  a  successful  eradication campaign  has  recently  been  concluded.  The  disease  continues  to  be reported  from  Papua  New  Guinea,  Brazil,  and  the  Guianas.  Large epidemics linked to ritual sexual practices are unique to Papua New Guinea, the last being reported in the 1950s. The disease is observed most commonly in young, sexually active male and female adults. Infections  in  Caucasians  are  conspicuously  rare.  In  the  countries where  it  is  seen,  the  disease  is  strongly  associated  with  poverty, prostitution, and marginalized communities. The predominance of genital lesions and association with other sexually transmitted infections point strongly to sex as the main mode of transmission.

NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS AND PATHOLOGY
Lesions  of  granuloma  inguinale  are  predominantly  genital,  but primary lesions of the anus and mouth are also seen. A small nodule

develops at the point of inoculation, later breaking down to form an ulcer.  Neglected ulcers tend to extend slowly  along  skin folds (Fig. 52.1). The infection reaches local lymph nodes via the lymphatics, leading to adenopathy, occasionally abscess formation (the 'pseudobubo') and, more commonly, to the development of inguinal ulceration. In women, primary lesions of the cervix may lead to ascending infection of uterus and tubes. Tearing of cervical lesions in labor can precipitate dangerous hematogenous dissemination to liver, spleen, and bone with potentially fatal outcome. Internal lesions in males are very  uncommon  and  involvement  of  the  rectum  is  exceptional. Chronic infections may be accompanied by scarring, lymphedema, fistula formation, and genital mutilation (auto-amputation of penis). Squamous carcinoma can develop as a late complication of chronic ulceration. Congenitally infected infants show a tendency to develop granulomatous lesions involving the ears and post-auricular nodes.

CLINICAL FEATURES
The incubation period reported by Clark was between 3 and 40 days in 92% of 60 patients. The most common sites of infection are the distal penis in men (Fig. 52.1) and vulva in women (Fig. 52.2). The ulcers are rarely painful. Lesions may be solitary or multiple. A characteristic pungent odor is associated with larger ulcers. Morphologic types of lesion include: (1) a beefy red, flat ulcer with a rolled margin (Fig. 52.2); (2) pale, hypertrophic lesions where granulomatous tissue pouts from the base of the ulcer (Fig. 52.1); and (3) cicatricial lesions where  extensive  scar  tissue  formation  is  seen  alongside  areas  of extending  ulceration.  Most  patients  with  inguinal  pathology  show firm nodes or ulcerative lesions in the skin overlying the nodes. The term pseudobubo was introduced by Greenblatt to describe unruptured fluctuant inguinal lesions. These are comparatively rare. A comparable  form  of  ulcer-adenopathy  syndrome  has  been  observed  in association with primary oral lesions. In women, lesions of the cervix may masquerade as cervical carcinoma and pelvic lesions can mimic pelvic  cancers,  including  the  development  of  hydronephrosis.  The clinical  picture  of  congenitally  transmitted  donovanosis  is  unusual and appears to result from infectious material being squeezed into the external  auditory meatus during  birth. Involvement of the ears and  local  nodes  has  been  reported  several  times  and  may  take  a number of weeks to appear.

PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS (see Table 5221)
Donovanosis should be considered in any patient with a genital ulcer and inguinal signs who reports unprotected sexual exposure in one of the regions where the disease remains endemic, particularly if more common causes of genital ulceration have been ruled out. The disease should  be  considered  in  any  patient  with  ulcerating  adenopathy involving  inguinal  or  cervical nodes.  The  differential  diagnosis includes  other  sexually  transmitted  diseases  that  produce  genital lesions,  especially  primary  and  secondary  syphilis,  chancroid  and lymphogranuloma venereum, squamous carcinoma involving cervix,

The  mainstay  of  diagnosis  is  the  demonstration  of  characteristic Donovan bodies (Fig. 52.3) within histiocytes obtained by smear or biopsy of ulcers and stained with Giemsa. When organisms are plentiful, it is sufficient to roll a swab across the ulcer to obtain a smear. A better preparation can be made by nipping off a small fragment of tissue and crushing it between two glass slides. Klebsiella granulomatis cannot  be  grown on solid  media.

TREATMENT (see Table 5222)
Donovanosis has been shown to respond to a wide variety of different antibiotics  [4].  No  recent  head-to-head  comparisons  have  been

Azithromycin, Dosage = 1 g weekly, until lesions have healed. Azithromycin, Strength of evidence = Ib. Doxycycline, Dosage = 100 mg twice daily, until lesions have healed. Doxycycline, Strength of evidence = IIb. Ceftriaxone, Dosage = 1 g daily intramuscular. Ceftriaxone, Strength of evidence = IIb. Cipro=oxacin, Dosage = 750 mg twice daily, until lesions have healed.

reported.  As  it  is  not  practical  to  isolate  the  organism  in  culture, investigation  of  antibiotic  sensitivity  is  not  currently  feasible.  The most recent trials have evaluated the use of azithromycin, comparing daily and weekly regimens and showing excellent results with both [5]. One of the attractions of azithromycin is its good penetration into cells. Alternative agents include tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, and third-generation cephalosporins.
The development of chronic genital lymphedema is not uncommon in neglected  cases,  especially  in  females.  Plastic  surgical  operations may be of help to correct such deformities.
