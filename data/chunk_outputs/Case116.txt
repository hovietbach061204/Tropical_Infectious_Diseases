in  low-income  countries  -  and  is  second  only  to  cardiovascular disease as a cause of death globally [3]. Much of the disparity between developed and developing countries is the result of differences in the age  structure  of  populations  and  the  greater  burden  of  infectious disease and perinatal mortality in the developing world. Over 80% of the population is aged less than 45 years in the developing world, compared  to  about  65%  in  the  developed  world  (Fig.  23.1)  and cancer is predominantly a disease of older people [1]. Despite this, although cancer is usually regarded as a problem of the developed world, about two-thirds of all cancers occur in the three-quarters of the world's population who live in developing countries, where comprehensive cancer control programs are limited or absent. There are more than 20 million people living with cancer at any  time  - the majority will not have access to appropriate diagnostic technology, curative  treatment,  or  palliative  care.  Furthermore,  the  number  of cases of cancer worldwide is likely to increase by about 50% by 2020 [2], primarily because of  increasing longevity of many populations and because of trends in the prevalence of smoking and other important risk factors.
In the developed world, cancers of the lung, breast, prostate, colon and rectum and hematologic malignancies predominate, whereas in the developing world the pattern differs. Whilst cancers of the lung and breast remain frequent, cancers of the cervix, liver, stomach and esophagus are also relatively  common, reflecting  differences  in  the prevalence of underlying causal factors. These estimates are available from the GLOBOCAN database at http://www.iarc.fr [1]. Indeed, even for those cancers for which the cause is unknown, the large differences in the pattern of cancer incidence between populations and over time suggest that cancer might be largely avoided if the responsible environmental factors could be identified and moderated.

TOBACCO
It is estimated that tobacco causes about 5 million deaths per year, corresponding to about a third of deaths in men aged 35-69 in North America and Europe and between 12% and 20% in the rest of the world [4]. It causes many diseases, of which the most important are cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive lung disease, and various cancers, including a large proportion of those of the lung, pancreas, bladder,  kidney,  larynx,  mouth,  pharynx  and  esophagus.  It  is  also associated with other types of cancer, such as stomach, liver, cervix, nasal  cavities,  colorectum  and  myeloid  leukemia  [5].  In  parts  of Southeast  Asia  in  particular,  the  combination  of  tobacco  use  and chewing of betel quid is an important risk factor for cancers of the mouth and pharynx.
Stopping smoking at any age has a rapid beneficial effect on cancer risk.  Indeed,  in  some  developed  countries,  reductions  in  tobacco consumption have been associated with declining incidence of certain cancers,  such  as  lung  cancer.  However,  cigarette  consumption  is increasing markedly in developing countries. Because of this  rising prevalence of smoking in developing countries, the incidence of many cancers and other tobacco-related diseases is rising, emphasizing the

INTRODUCTION
In this chapter we describe patterns of cancer in developing countries, outline some of the most important causes, and briefly examine issues relating to screening and prevention. We then go on to discuss treatment  and  palliation  in  resource-poor  settings.  Clinical  signs  and symptoms of different cancer types are addressed in many other textbooks  and  are  not  discussed  further  here.  Some  of  the  content  is updated from a chapter in the  previous edition  of this volume  by Parkin and Ziegler.
Before going further, it is important to  note that  estimation of the burden of cancer (or any other disease) in developing countries is problematic  and  so  data  should  be  interpreted  with  appropriate caution. Overall, about 4-5% of the population of developing countries is covered by routine registration of mortality statistics. Cancer registries are another important source of data on cancer occurrence, but again, they cover only limited geographic areas - about 3% of the population  of  developing  countries  -  although  they  can  provide information on the current cancer profile and its evolution over time. Based on these limited data, it is possible to obtain working estimates of  the  burden  of  cancer  in  tropical  countries  and  elsewhere  (both incidence - usually expressed as the number of new cases per 100,000 people per year - and mortality), albeit with a number of important methodologic caveats.
In the year 2008, it is estimated that about 12.7 million people worldwide were diagnosed with cancer and about 7.6 million people died from the disease, an increase of about 25% since 1990 [1,2]. Overall, cancer causes about 10% of all deaths worldwide - 27% of deaths in developed countries, 15% in middle-income countries and about 6%

importance of tobacco control programs. For example, in some Asian countries, lung cancer mortality rates have more than doubled in the last 30 years. Indeed, it has been estimated that if smoking rates could be  halved,  between  20  and  30  million  premature  deaths  from  all causes would be avoided by 2025 and about 150 million deaths by 2050 [4]. Efforts to reduce tobacco consumption are therefore central to preventing deaths from cancer and other diseases.

INFECTIONS
Collectively,  infectious  agents  are  the  most  important  established cause of cancer after tobacco. Approximately 18% of cancers worldwide (about 1.6 million cases per year) are attributable to viral (13%), bacterial  (5%),  and  helminth  (0.1%)  infections,  the  majority  of which occur in the developing world [4]. In theory, if these infectious diseases  were  controlled,  up  to  one  in  four  cancers  in  developing countries,  and  one in ten cancers in developed countries, could be prevented.
More cancer cases are attributable to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection than to any other transmissible agent. It is well established that certain HPVs are the major causative agent for invasive cervical cancer.  The  most  common  HPV  subtypes  identified  in  tumors  are HPV16,  18,  31,  33  and  45,  although  in  some  Asian  countries  the subtypes HPV52 and 58 are more common. The same subtypes also account for up to 80% of cancers of the anus and approximately onethird of cancers of the penis, vagina and vulva. HPV infection may also cause some cancers of the head and neck (particularly cancers of the oral cavity) [6]. In developed countries, cervical cancer screening programs that rely on the detection, by exfoliative cervical cytology, of treatable precancerous lesions, are established and are effective at reducing both the incidence and mortality of invasive cervical cancer. However, in many developing countries, screening procedures do not yet exist and incidence and mortality rates are still very high. Vaccination against the main HPV subtypes at an early age holds the most promise to substantially reduce the incidence of this cancer, although the  cost  remains  prohibitively  high.  However,  cheaper  HPV  DNA screening  technology  has  emerged  and  this  is  proving  to  be  much more cost-effective than vaccination at current costs [7].

Chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus is responsible for causing more  than  300,000  liver  cancers  (specifically  hepatocellular  carcinoma) each year, which corresponds to about 60% of all primary liver cancers across the world [6]. Approximately 10% of the population in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, China, and Southeast Asia are infected with the hepatitis B virus. Transmission can occur from a mother to her child, from person to person during childhood, and via sexual or parenteral transmission during adulthood. About two-thirds of these people  will  develop  chronic  hepatitis,  and  a  quarter  of  these  will eventually  die  from  primary  liver  cancer  or  cirrhosis,  making  liver
cancer one of the most common cancers in these areas. Prospects for the prevention of hepatitis B virus-associated liver cancer are good. In developed  countries,  screening  of  blood  and  organ  donors  has reduced the spread of infection among adults. In areas where infection is most prevalent, however, the best hope for prevention lies with mass  vaccination  against  the  hepatitis  B  virus.  Although  it  will  be many years before an effect on the incidence of liver cancer is demonstrated in adults, the introduction of mass vaccination in Taiwan has already been associated with a sharp decline in the incidence of liver cancer in children and young adults [4].
The  unrelated  hepatitis  C  virus  is  also  involved  in  the  etiology  of hepatocellular  carcinoma  and  may  cause  about  25%  of  all  liver cancers,  with  particularly  high  proportions  in  Africa  (41%),  Japan (36%) and Oceania (33%). The prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection is estimated to be about 1-1.5% in Europe and North America, about  3%  in  Japan  and  Oceania  (excluding  Australia  and  New Zealand), and up to 3.6% in Africa. Transmission is commonly via the parenteral route, although sexual and perinatal transmission can also occur. However, almost half of all hepatitis C-infected individuals have no identifiable risk  factors [8]. Although a vaccine is not  currently available,  screening  programs have  greatly  reduced transmission of hepatitis C via blood transfusions.

Infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is involved in the etiology of  several  types  of  lymphoma  (including  Burkitt's  lymphoma, Hodgkin disease, and immunosuppression-related lymphomas) and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and may contribute up to 100,000 cancers per year worldwide [6]. Indeed, Burkitt lymphoma (associated with both EBV and malaria) is the commonest childhood cancer in many tropical areas. EBV infects more than 90% of the world's population and is usually acquired during childhood. It is transmitted orally in saliva and establishes a latent infection  with lifelong persistence in the  infected  host.  The  overgrowth  of  virally  transformed  B  cells  is controlled by specific cytotoxic T-cell responses, the absence of which (in HIV-infected people for example) can result in lymphoma.
Kaposi's  sarcoma-associated  herpesvirus  (KSHV)  is  related  to  the Epstein-Barr virus and is the principal cause of Kaposi's sarcoma [6]. It also causes a rare type of lymphoma (primary effusion lymphoma) and  a  lymphoproliferative  B-cell  disorder  (Castleman's  disease). KSHV is most prevalent in populations at highest risk of developing Kaposi  sarcoma,  such  as  homosexual  men  infected  with  HIV  in Western countries and in African populations where the tumor has long been endemic.
Human T-cell  leukemia  virus  type  1  (HTLV-1)  is  a causal  agent  of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. It is estimated that there are about 15-20 million individuals infected with HTLV-1 worldwide, predominantly in Japan, the Caribbean, South America, and Central Africa. Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma develops in about 2-5% of HTLV1-infected individuals and is especially frequent among those infected early in life. Perinatal transmission has been greatly reduced in Japan by avoidance of prolonged breastfeeding (i.e. more than 6 months), although this is not an option for many developing countries, where the risk of death from diarrheal disease rises markedly if breastfeeding is curtailed. Several countries have introduced universal screening of blood donors [6,8].

There is little evidence that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has a direct oncogenic effect. Instead, its immunosuppressive effect appears  to  facilitate  the  development  of  Kaposi  sarcoma,  nonHodgkin and Hodgkin lymphoma, and cancers of the cervix, anus and conjunctiva [6]. In areas of sub-Saharan Africa where HIV infection is highly prevalent, the incidence of Kaposi sarcoma has increased about 20-fold with the spread of HIV, such that in Uganda and Zimbabwe it is now the most common cancer in males and among the most common in females. There is evidence of a reduction  in the increase  in  risk  of  both  Kaposi's  sarcoma  and  non-Hodgkin  lymphoma among those on antiretroviral therapy for HIV [9]. However, in the developing world, the incidence of HIV-associated cancers is increasing as the epidemic spreads.
About half of the world's population is chronically infected with the bacterium Helicobacter  pylori .  This  bacterium colonizes the stomach lining, and, although many people remain asymptomatic, some go on to develop gastric or duodenal ulcers. In a very small proportion of infected individuals, gastric adenocarcinoma and, to a lesser extent, gastric non-Hodgkin lymphoma may develop [6]. Although it is clear that H. pylori infection  plays a role in the development of stomach cancer, other factors, such as diet, are also involved. The prevalence of infection is highest in developing countries and increases rapidly during the first two decades of life, such that 80-90% of the population may be infected by early adulthood; in most developed countries, the prevalence of infection is now substantially lower. Rates of infection with H. pylori have fallen over the last few decades, and this could explain much of the parallel decline in stomach cancer rates seen in most countries. This may be due to improvements in living conditions and trends towards a smaller family size, both of which are risk factors  for H.  pylori infection.  Although  antibiotics  are  effective  in eradicating H. pylori in about 80% of cases, this has proved to be difficult to implement on a large scale and re-infection is common.

Infestation with the water-borne trematode Schistosoma haematobium , which  causes  schistosomiasis  (bilharzia),  is  associated  with  an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder, and is the predominant cause of this cancer in tropical and subtropical areas. Schistosomiasis affects approximately 200 million people worldwide and is endemic in Northern Africa and the Middle East; in these areas, over half of the population is at risk of infection from contaminated water supplies (lakes, rivers, swamps) that contain the larvae. There is also some evidence that S. japonicum and, to a lesser extent, S. mansoni are related to the development of cancers of the liver and colorectum in  China.  Although  treatable,  preventative  measures  focusing  on reducing contact with contaminated water supplies are currently the best  method  of  reducing  infection.  Food-borne  trematodes  (liver flukes), such as Opisthorchis viverrini , Opisthorchis felineus and Clonorchis  sinensis ,  are  an  established  cause  of  cancer  of  the  bile  ducts (cholangiocarcinoma) in parts of Southeast Asia, due to consumption of raw or undercooked freshwater fish that contain the infective stage of the fluke. Control of infection has been achieved in some areas by a  combination  of  chemotherapy,  health  education,  and  improved sanitation.  However,  eradication  programs  have,  as  yet,  had  little effect on the incidence of cholangiocarcinoma in these areas and a vaccine is not yet available.

OTHER FACTORS
Hormonal  and  reproductive  factors  play  an  important  role  in  the etiology of a number of cancers in women, especially breast cancer. Established risk factors include early age at menarche, older age at first birth,  low  parity,  and  late  age  at  menopause.  The  combination  of these  factors  may  explain  much  of  the  geographic  variation  in  the incidence of breast cancer. Many of these reproductive factors suggest that  cumulative  exposure  to  estrogens  during  a  woman's  lifetime increases the risk of breast cancer. It is now known that high circulating levels of estrogens are directly associated with breast cancer risk, at least in postmenopausal women [10]. Further evidence for a role of hormones comes from consistent observations that current users of  exogenous  hormones,  either  in  the  form  of  oral  and  injectable contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy (HRT), have a 2535% higher risk  of  developing  breast  cancer  than never-users  [10]. However, this risk appears to be transient and has largely disappeared after  10 years since  stopping. Reproductive factors are also strongly related  to  ovarian  cancer  and,  as  for  endometrial  cancer,  the  most established protective factors are parity and use of hormonal contraceptives. In general, a first-term pregnancy is associated with about a 40% reduction in risk, with a smaller reduction in risk with each term pregnancy thereafter.

============================================================
OTHER FACTORS
Several dietary factors, such as fat and meat, have been suggested to increase cancer risk, while other factors, such as fruit, vegetables and fibre,  have  been  hypothesized  to  decrease  risk.  However,  despite extensive research over the last two decades, few specific dietary determinants of cancer risk have been established, even for cancers such as colorectal cancer where dietary factors are the most obvious candidate risk factors. This is due to various reasons, the most important being the difficulty in accurately measuring dietary intake in epidemiologic studies. Other problems with epidemiologic studies of diet and cancer include the relatively narrow range of dietary exposures within one population, and the changes in dietary patterns over time, so  that  it  is  very  difficult  to  determine  whether  dietary  habits  at  a young age may affect cancer risk later in life. A high intake of alcoholic beverages increases the risk of cancers of the upper respiratory and digestive  tracts  (oral  cavity,  tongue,  pharynx,  larynx,  esophagus). These cancers are also caused by smoking, and the increase in risk is particularly great for people who both smoke and drink heavily [5]. Heavy and prolonged alcohol consumption is also associated with liver cancer via the development of cirrhosis and alcoholic hepatitis. Cancers of the upper gastrointestinal tract are particularly associated with excessive alcohol consumption, although a moderate intake of 10 g of alcohol per day (approximately one drink) has been shown to increase the risk of breast cancer by around 7%.
Aflatoxins are mycotoxins produced by many species of the fungus Aspergillus and are among the most carcinogenic substances known. The fungi live in soil, particularly in warm and damp conditions, such as in the tropics, and are a common contaminant of cereals, oilseeds, nuts and spices. The toxin can also be found in milk from humans and livestock if the food supply is contaminated [1 1]. Consequences of  exposure  can  include  growth  retardation  and  hepatic  necrosis leading to cirrhosis and carcinoma of the liver. Concurrent infection with  hepatitis  B  virus  increases  the  risk  of  cancer  further,  since  it interferes with the metabolism of aflatoxins.

OTHER FACTORS
Overweight and obesity  are  usually  measured  in terms  of  an  individual's  body  mass  index  (BMI)  (weight  in  kilograms  divided  by height in meters squared), where a BMI of greater than 25 kg/m 2 is considered overweight and a BMI of greater than 30 kg/m 2 is considered obese. Overweight and obesity increase the risk of colon cancer by about a third and increase the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal  (but  not  premenopausal)  women  by  about  a  half.  Overweight  and  obesity  are  associated  with  an  approximate  threefold increased risk of endometrial cancer in both pre- and postmenopausal women, and may account for up to 40% of endometrial cancer worldwide. Overweight and obesity also increase the risk of cancers of  the  kidney  and  gallbladder  and  of  adenocarcinoma  (but  not squamous cell carcinoma) of the esophagus. It has been estimated that overweight and obesity account for about 5% of all cancers in Europe, most of which are cancers of the colon, endometrium and breast. Thus, up to 36,000 cases of cancer could be prevented each year  if  the  prevalence  of  overweight  and  obesity  in  Europe  was halved  [12].  In  countries  such  as  the  US,  where  the  prevalence  of obesity  is  higher  than  in  Europe,  an  even  higher  proportion  of cancers  may  be  attributable  to  being  overweight.  Furthermore,  the prevalence of obesity is increasing in both developed and developing countries, and is therefore expected to lead to a greater burden of cancers in the future.

MANAGEMENT OF CANCER
Cancer management requires multidisciplinary services and is often a complex and expensive process. In Western countries, the pathway starts  with  access  to  cancer  services,  often  through  screening  or  a primary care physician. Decisions surrounding the most appropriate treatment for an individual with cancer require: 1) an accurate pathologic diagnosis which may involve sophisticated immunohistologic and genetic profiling; 2) imaging, for stage, planning treatment, and monitoring;  3)  biochemical  markers,  for  example  prostate-specific antigen  (PSA),  for  monitoring,  diagnosis,  prognosis,  response  and relapse; and 4) laboratory work-up including hematology and renal and liver function tests. There are four general modalities of treatment for cancer: 1) surgery; 2) drugs, including hormones and chemotherapies;  3)  radiotherapy;  and  4)  symptom  control  or  palliative  care. Outcome for treatment of malignant disease, in general, depends on the  clinical  and  pathologic  stage  (tumor,  size,  nodal  involvement, metastasis  [local  or  distant],  histologic  features  [spectrum  from
benign  to  aggressive])  and  patient  comorbidities  or  performance status.

============================================================
CHUNK 13
============================================================
MANAGEMENT OF CANCER
Cure or long-term survival from cancer is largely dependent on cancer stage. All treatment modalities work best on small localized tumors with nonaggressive histologic features. In low-income settings, presentation with cancer (like other illnesses) is very often late with widespread  neoplastic  disease and a  high  burden of symptoms.  Factors impacting  on  access  to  medical  care  are  multifactorial,  involving patient  awareness  of  cancer  and  symptoms,  fear  of  stigmatization, preference for traditional healers [13], cultural barriers that cancer is induced by supernatural forces and /or incurable [14], health worker knowledge, health infrastructure, and cost to patients. Once accessed, the availability of diagnostic and treatment modalities is often limited, resulting  in  generally  poor  survival  in  these  settings.  Adherence  to treatment  regimens  is  often  low  [15].  For  countries  already  overstretched and grappling with infectious disease including HIV, TB and malaria,  cancer  is  not  a  priority  for  healthcare.  Cancer  survival  in resource-poor  settings  is  currently  very  poor,  particularly  in  subSaharan  Africa  [16,17],  and  is  directly  associated  with  per  capita annual government healthcare expenditure and number of physicians [16]. Government expenditure on health in 2006 (US$), was $8 for low-income countries compared to $3076 in the USA, with only four physicians per 10,000 population in low-income countries compared to 27 per 10,000 in high-income countries [18].
Surgery is an essential part of treatment for solid neoplastic disease and the modality most likely to cure. Again, the probability of cure is increased when the cancer is small and localized, but surgery also plays a role in the management of metastasis and in palliation, for example  of  bowel  obstruction,  fistulas  and  gastrointestinal  bleeds. There  is  a  paucity  of  data  from  resource-poor  settings  on  surgical oncology provision, but unmet surgical need it likely to be very high [19].

============================================================
MANAGEMENT OF CANCER
Cancer chemotherapies kill cancer cells by preventing cell division, disrupting DNA or RNA or nucleic acids. It is effective against systemic disease and can be used with both palliative and curative intent before and after surgery and/or radiotherapy. Other forms of drug treatments include hormones (for example, the anti-estrogen tamoxifen for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, and LHRH antagonists for prostate cancer) and immunotherapy (for example, interferon-alpha, used for  some  hematologic  malignancies,  and  monoclonal  antibodies, including trastuzumab and rituximab). Drugs with different mechanisms of action are often given in combination to increase efficacy. In resource-limited settings, low availability of cancer drugs - together with the drugs required to control side effects, including antiemetics and antibiotics is problematic. Cytotoxic agents, tamoxifen and steroids are listed in the WHO essential medicines complementary list, which presents essential medicines for priority diseases which need specialist care and/or high costs [20]. Chemotherapies ideally require specialist pharmacy rooms for preparation, a high degree of sterility, dedicated  and  highly  trained  staff  and  high  levels  of  support  to manage iatrogenic toxicities.
Radiotherapy is a common component of cancer treatment for cure or palliation and can be used alone or as an adjuvant to surgery to destroy cancer cells remaining in the tumor bed or with chemotherapy. Radiation acts by damaging cellular DNA by forming free radicals. Cancer cells have less ability to repair DNA damage than healthy cells and lose reproductive capacity or die by apoptosis. Radiotherapy can be broadly divided into external beam or local, where the radiation source is placed in the body, within or close to the cancer. External  beam megavoltage radiation can be derived from a radioactive source such as cobalt-60 or by accelerating electrons at high energy to produce photons (linear accelerator). Resource-limited settings are more likely to use a radioactive source over a linear accelerator as it is comparatively cheaper, robust, requires only limited electricity and is  much  easier  to  maintain.  Safe  provision  requires  specifically designed  buildings,  monitoring,  and  an  extensive  team  of  trained medical, engineering and scientific staff.

Barriers to opioid access include: 1) cost, 2) lack of trained medical workforce to administer, 3) international regulations on manufacture and distribution of opioids, and 4) health worker and public attitude and knowledge due to concerns over addiction (Fig.  23.3).  Advocacy groups, including Hospice Africa, have  made great progress in improving access to symptom control by lobbying governments, training, increasing awareness and developing feasible models of care for resource-limited settings.
