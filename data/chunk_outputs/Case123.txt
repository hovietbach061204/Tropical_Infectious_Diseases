Key features
- Viruses are the major etiologic agents of acute gastroenteritis, both in developing and developed countries, particularly in children younger than 5 years of age; in this age group diarrhea is the second most common cause of death
- All gastroenteritis viruses, also referred to as diarrhea viruses, cause acute-onset, watery, non-bloody diarrhea
- There are currently four genera and one species of viruses recognized as established causes of gastroenteritis in humans: Rotavirus, Norovirus, Sapovirus, Astrovirus and Human adenovirus F (also referred to as enteric adenoviruses)
- Diarrhea caused by these gastroenteritis viruses is indistinguishable by clinical features alone; etiologic diagnosis requires laboratory investigation

- The disease is self-limiting in otherwise healthy individuals, but oral or intravenous rehydration therapy is required for mildly or severely dehydrated patients
- Vaccines are available for rotavirus-one of the most important causes of viral diarrhea

INTRODUCTION
Acute diarrhea is the cardinal symptom of viral gastrointestinal infection and is defined as the passage of three or more watery or looserthan-usual stools within the preceding 24 hours for less than 2 weeks' duration.  Globally,  diarrhea  is  the  second  most  common  cause  of death (18%, 10.8 million) in children younger than 5 years of age and it causes more deaths in this age group than HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria put altogether (Fig. 30.1). Viruses account for the major proportion of causative agents responsible for acute gastroenteritis both in developing and developed countries.
Viral  gastroenteritis  generally  presents  a  similar  clinical  picturewhatever the virus-requiring laboratory investigation for establishing its  etiology.  Signs and  symptoms  of typical acute viral gastroenteritis include acute onset of diarrhea, often with preceding vomiting, and sometimes with fever and abdominal pain. The most important complication  is  dehydration  and  this  requires  oral or intravenous fluid replacement therapy depending on the degree of dehydration. The disease typically lasts  3-5  days  and  is  self-limiting.  The viruses  are transmitted  feco-orally  and  infect  the  epithelial  cells  of  the  small intestine.  Damage  to  the  villous  epithelium  of  the  small  intestine affects the absorption of fluid and causes watery diarrhea. No inflammation occurs as the viruses only multiply within the enterocytes in the intestinal epithelium and do not spread into the submucosa.

There are currently four genera and one species of viruses recognized as established causes of gastroenteritis in humans: Rotavirus, Norovirus, Sapovirus, Astrovirus and Human adenovirus F (to which serotypes 40 and 41 belong and which are also referred to as enteric adenoviruses). As these viruses are often shed in large numbers into stool, they can be identified by direct, negative-stain electron microscopy based on their  characteristic  morphology  (Fig.  30.2).  What  were  previously called small-round structured viruses (SRSV) roughly correspond to norovirus and morphologically identified human caliciviruses correspond to sapovirus; however, the distinction of both norovirus and sapovirus is to be made at the level of nucleotide sequence. The use of  the  term  'human  calicivirus'  is  discouraged because  it is  sometimes confusing whether human calicivirus refers to both norovirus and  sapovirus  (they  are  calicivirses  causing  disease  in  humans)  or only morphologically identified human caliciviruses, in which case noroviruses are excluded.
The major features of these gastroenteritis viruses are summarized in Table 30-1.
