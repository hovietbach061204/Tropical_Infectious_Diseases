IMPETIGO
Impetigo is a very common and contagious bacterial skin infection that characteristically involves the face and classically manifests as honey-colored, crusted erosions and scabs. There are two forms, bullous and non-bullous, with the non-bullous form being more common in children. Impetigo is especially common in hot, humid, tropical  climates,  and  the  peak  number  of  cases  is  seen  in  the summer  and  rainy  season.  Nasal,  axillary,  pharyngeal,  and/or perineal Staphylococcus  aureus colonization  imparts  an  increased risk for developing impetigo. 1
Worldwide, non-bullous impetigo is most commonly caused by S. aureus, whereas a minority of cases are caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (group A beta-hemolytic streptococci) or a mixed infection. In  5%  of  cases,  non-bullous  impetigo  is  caused  by S.  pyogenes (serotypes  1,  4,  12,  25,  and  49)  and  can  result  in  acute  post2
Bullous impetigo is exclusively caused by the exfoliatin toxinsecreting strain of S. aureus and is most commonly seen in children under the age of 2 years. Bullous impetigo is considered a localized form of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS).
Clinically,  impetigo  classically  manifests  as  grouped  fragile vesicles that proceed to become cloudy pustules that easily rupture (Fig. 61.1). After rupture, the lesions become crusted, honey-colored erosions. The most common areas of involvement are the face and neck, and sometimes the extremities. In contrast to non-bullous impetigo, bullous impetigo can occur on intact skin. Initially, small vesicles  and  pus-{lled  bullae  are  seen. The  lesions  enlarge  and become |accid, transparent bullae measuring up to 3 to 5 cm in

Treatment involves local hygiene with soap and water, followed by  application  of  an  anti-bacterial  agent.  In  resource-limited settings,  topical  0.5%  gentian  violet  (GV)  paint  is  commonly available as a cheap and effective anti-bacterial agent. For extensive disease,  oral  antibiotics,  such  as  cloxacillin,  erythromycin,  or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, may be used. Oral doxycycline may also be used in the adult population. T o reduce the risk of relapse, it is important to note that impetigo may be a secondary complication of other underlying dermatoses, such as scabies, insect bites, atopic dermatitis, and dermatophytosis.

ECTHYMA
Ecthyma is  considered the  ulcerated  form  of  bullous  impetigo and is usually caused by S. pyogenes . 4 It initially presents as a vesicle that develops into a shallow 'punched-out' ulcer with a necrotic base, usually on the lower extremities (Fig. 61.2). The ulcers are usually multiple and smaller in size than tropical ulcers. The most common locations are the backs of legs, thighs and buttocks, and, occasionally, on the trunk and arms. In the tropics, ecthyma usually occurs in those working in damp, swampy, and humid environments, for  example,  rice  paddy  workers.  T reatment  includes  systemic antibiotics in conjunction with topical antibiotics, such as fusidic acid or topical 0.5% GV paint application daily, along with leg elevation.

FOLLICULITIS, FURUNCLES, AND CARBUNCLES
Folliculitis usually presents as papules and pustules centered around a hair follicle. Furuncles are acute, in|ammatory, deep abscesses of the hair follicles and begin as a hard, tender, red nodule that becomes  painful  and  |uctuant. S.  aureus is  the  most  common causative organism, although anaerobes are implicated in recurrent furuncles in the anogenital region. It is  also important to note that furuncular myiasis should be considered in the differential diagnosis in some tropical areas.
Carbuncles are collections of furuncles that extend deep into the  subcutaneous  tissue  with  overlying  sinus  tracts.  Systemic symptoms are usually present, and carbuncles usually heal with residual scarring.
For simple furuncles, warm compresses may promote resolution, whereas |uctuant lesions require incision and drainage. Systemic antibiotics should be used for large and recurrent lesions.

CELLULITIS
Cellulitis is a bacterial infection of the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue. It is most commonly caused by S. pyogenes and S. aureus . 5 Bacteria  may  gain  access  to  the  dermis  via  a  break  in  the  skin barrier in healthy adults, whereas the hematogenous route is more common in immunocompromised patients.
The  affected  skin  is  usually  erythematous,  swollen,  painful, and warm to the touch. Severe cellulitis can be complicated by

bullae, pustules, or necrotic tissue. Damage to lymphatic vessels can lead to recurrent episodes of cellulitis. 6 In areas of the world endemic for lymphatic {lariasis, it is important to rule out this disease  in  cases  of  recurrent  bouts  of  lower-extremity  cellulitis and lymphangitis.
The differential diagnosis of lower extremity cellulitis includes deep vein thrombosis, super{cial thrombophlebitis, and lipodermatosclerosis. It is also important to rule out necrotizing fasciitis, especially  when the cellulitis  is associated  with  the  presence  of anesthesia and bullae.
with an oral antibiotic targeting gram-positive organisms. Intravenous therapy and hospitalization should be considered for patients who have facial  cellulitis,  underlying  diabetes,  or  cellulitis  surrounding decubitus  ulcers  and  those  with  progressive  systemic symptoms. Speci{c types of cellulitis (e.g., those caused by Erysipelothrix  rhusiopathiae and Vibrio  vulniScus )  may  present  with overlying hemorrhagic bullae. 7

GAS GANGRENE
This is a rare infection of the skin caused by exotoxin-producing Clostridia  species.  The  most  common  type  is  traumatic  gas gangrene, which occurs via direct inoculation of a contaminated ischemic wound with soil or fecal matter, or sometimes after an abdominal  surgical  procedure.  The  causative  organism  is Clostridium perfringens in about 80% to 95% of cases. The infection is rapidly progressive with symptoms of sepsis, myonecrosis, and gas  production;  this  condition  counts  as  an  infectious  disease emergency.
The  key  feature  is  pain  out  of  proportion  to  the  physical cutaneous {ndings. Light-to-dark brown discoloration of the skin with  associated  crepitus  and  bullae  may  be  accompanied  by  a foul-smelling, serosanguinous drainage. The patient may exhibit other signs of toxemia. The crepitus is an important clinical clue and, if available, a plain radiograph may reveal the presence of gas in the soft tissue.
The mainstay of treatment is wide surgical excision and debridement in conjunction with systemic antibiotic therapy (high-dose penicillin,  often  with  an  agent  that  inhibits  bacterial  protein synthesis  such  as  clindamycin,  may  be  used).  In  severe  cases, amputation may be necessary.

NECROTIZING FASCIITIS
Necrotizing fasciitis is a rapidly progressive, in|ammatory infection of the deep fascia associated with a high morbidity and mortality. The infection may follow trauma or occur around foreign bodies in  surgical wounds. The initiating bacteria are usually group A hemolytic streptococci and S. aureus. Resolving varicella is a risk factor for bacterial superinfection. Necrotizing fasciitis caused by mixed aerobic and anaerobic infection is associated with involvement of the pelvic and abdominal areas. 8
The presence of anesthesia suggests deeper extension of a soft tissue  infection.  Clinical  clues  that  suggest  necrotizing  fasciitis include severe pain, rapidly spreading tense edema, hemorrhagic bullae  formation,  crepitus,  gray-blue  discoloration,  'dishwater' discharge, and elevated creatine phosphokinase level.
Successful management demands early diagnosis, rapid resuscitation,  and  aggressive  surgical  excision  and  debridement  coupled with  high  doses  of  broad-spectrum  antibiotics  targeting  the causative agents. 9 causes,  often  given  in  conjunction  with  clindamycin  to  inhibit bacterial  protein  synthesis.  If  a  causative  agent  is  not  known, broad-spectrum antibiotics that target methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA),  gram-negative  organisms,  and  anaerobes  should  be some bene{t to patients with streptococcal-associated necrotizing utilized in combination with aggressive surgical debridement and antibiotics.

TROPICAL (PHAGEDENIC) ULCER
The term tropical ulcer is used to denote ulcers of the lower legs that  occur  in  people  in  the  tropics,  especially  during  the  rainy season. Y oung children are affected more frequently, and the ulcers are usually a polymicrobial infection.
Clinically, the ulcer starts off as a fairly well-demarcated, painful, round ulcer with surrounding erythema on the lower legs. Exposure of the injured skin to mud and slow-moving freshwater has also been implicated. 10 Over the course of a few weeks, the ulcer becomes less painful and may heal with residual scarring.
If the ulcer has purulent discharge, treatment should include systemic  antibiotics.  The  ulcer  base  should  be  cleaned  and  leg elevation advised. T opical treatments include daily cleaning of the ulcer with 1% to 6% hydrogen peroxide solution or GV paint and covering the ulcer with moist gauze. 11

Once referred to as tropical myositis , it is becoming more prevalent in temperate climates. area, but pyomyositis in temperate climates is also associated with
Diagnosis is often dif{cult, as patients frequently present with non-speci{c signs and symptoms, including myalgias and low-grade mass over 10 to 14 days is characteristic. A 'woody' induration is observed on palpation of involved soft tissues. Muscle abscess formation occurs during the second stage of disease, and septic shock may follow.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), although recommended, is not readily available in many locations. In some cases, pyomyositis can  be  con{rmed  by  ultrasound-guided  aspiration.  Treatment includes surgical incision and drainage and appropriate intravenous antibiotics until clinical improvement is noted, followed by oral antibiotics for a total of 1 to 3 weeks.
Large muscles of the trunk and proximal compartments of the limbs are usual sites of involvement.
