- Group A Streptococcus or Streptococcus pyogenes is the predominant global cause of bacterial pharyngitis and skin infection
- Group A Streptococcus is also a cause of severe invasive, necrotizing and toxin-mediated syndromes and debilitating non-suppurative sequelae, including rheumatic fever and acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis

settings, while only 1 episode every 7-8 child years has been observed in developed urban settings. Limited data on the incidence of Group A Streptococcus pharyngitis in tropical areas suggest significant variability, with rates comparable to temperate climates in some settings but, in others, the documented rate is considerably lower. Transmission is higher in winter months. Impetigo is common in childhood; transmission occurs readily in school and preschool care settings,  especially in the summer months. In tropical settings where the burden is  particularly  high,  the  majority  of  children in  some  communities have impetigo at any one time.
- Group A Streptococcus is estimated to result in over 500,000 deaths annually, mostly in developing countries and mostly because of invasive infection or from rheumatic heart disease and its complications
- Group A Streptococcus remains universally sensitive to penicillin which remains the mainstay of treatment of Group A Streptococcus infections and the prevention of rheumatic heart disease

INTRODUCTION
Group A Streptococcus causes  a  diverse  spectrum of  disease, ranging from benign and self-limited infection of the throat or skin, to lethal soft tissue infections accompanied by multi-organ failure. Until the advent of the antibiotic era, Group A Streptococcus was a major cause of death in industrialized countries as a result of sepsis, rheumatic heart disease and fatal epidemics of scarlet fever [1, 2]. The 1980s saw an increase in rheumatic fever cases in the Rocky Mountain states of the USA, along with an apparent resurgence in severe Group A Streptococcus disease  in  industrialized  countries.  The  resultant  increased attention  paid to  Group  A Streptococcus disease  in  recent  years  has also brought to focus the continuing high burden of Group A Streptococcus disease in developing countries, particularly those in tropical regions [3].

============================================================

============================================================
EPIDEMIOLOGY
The  burden  of  all  Group  A Streptococcus infections  is  highest  in resource-limited settings, most of which are in tropical regions. It is assumed that the major reasons for this relate to poverty, overcrowded living conditions and limited access to medical care, although geography and climate may also play a role. The estimated number of cases and deaths of Group A Streptococcus diseases is shown in Table 36-1. Of the more severe diseases, 79% of rheumatic heart disease cases, 95% of acute rheumatic fever cases, 97% of acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis cases and 97% of invasive Group A Streptococcus cases come from less developed countries [3].
Pharyngitis is the most common manifestation of Group A Streptococcus disease-its  incidence  is  highest  in  school-aged  children.  One episode  occurs  every  1-2  child  years  in  some  resource-limited
Cellulitis and erysipelas are the most frequent manifestations of invasive Group A Streptococcus infection and, in contrast to pharyngitis and impetigo,  incidence  increases  with  age.  In  the  mid-1980s,  reports emerged from industrialized countries of both increasing numbers of severe necrotizing Group A Streptococcus infections and of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome [4]. Group A Streptococcus strains belonging to emm types  1  and  3,  in  particular,  have  been  implicated  in  this rise.  Most  cases  of severe invasive Group  A Streptococcus disease are sporadic, but secondary cases and case clusters have been reported. Limited data suggest that both the incidence and case-fatality of invasive  Group  A Streptococcus disease  in  resource-limited  countries  is several-fold higher than in industrialized countries.

============================================================
CHUNK 4
============================================================
EPIDEMIOLOGY
Acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease continue to result in a substantial component of Group A Streptococcus -related morbidity and mortality in resource-limited settings. Of the 5 17,000 Group A Streptococcus -related deaths each year, it is estimated that two thirds are caused by rheumatic heart disease or its complications [3]. The true  prevalence  of  rheumatic  heart  disease remains  uncertain,  with estimates of at least 1.3 per 1000 school-aged children in developing countries based on auscultatory screening, while estimates based on echocardiography suggest the true prevalence may be more than 10 times higher [5]. Acute rheumatic fever has become uncommon in industrialized settings, although the incidence remains high among indigenous populations in Australia and New Zealand.
The incidence of acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis appears to be declining in industrialized settings, but sporadic cases still occur. Acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis continues to occur both sporadically and in epidemics in tropical climates (where Group A Streptococcus pyoderma  is  also  common);  limited  data  suggest  that acute mortality and chronic morbidity from acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis may be higher in developing settings.

NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS AND PATHOLOGY
The  oropharynx  and  the  skin  of  humans  are  the  only  recognized ecologic niches for Group A Streptococcus and they represent the major entry sites for both local and invasive infection [6]  (see  Fig. 36.1). Up to 20% of school-aged children may be colonized in the oropharynx in temperate and some tropical regions, although in many tropical  settings,  less  than  5%  of  children  carry  Group  A Streptococcus (with  groups  C  and  G  streptococci  being  more  common).  Surface proteins facilitate specific adhesion of Group A Streptococcus to either the  mucosal  epithelium  of  the  throat  or  to  the  skin  (or  both).

Asymptomatic  colonization  of  the  oropharynx  may  persist  at  low levels for weeks without eliciting a host immune response. Colonization  of  the  skin  is  more  transient,  becoming established  only  days before inoculation (e.g. by insect bite) and subsequent pyoderma.
Local infection of the oropharynx (pharyngitis) or skin (pyoderma) is  mostly  benign  with spontaneous resolution usually within days. Invasion of Group A Streptococcus into normally sterile sites occurs less commonly,  but  is  often  severe  with  clinical  manifestations  arising from complex host-pathogen interactions. Preceding viral infection, in particular with varicella or influenza A, has been implicated as a frequent antecedent to invasive infection. The skin and throat are the major portals for entry, after which Group A Streptococcus evades host defenses by elaborating a number of virulence factors, chief of which is M protein that extends as hair-like filaments from the cell surface. M  protein  (together  with  the  hyaluronic  acid  capsule  and  other surface proteins) enables Group A Streptococcus to evade phagocytosis by  multiple  mechanisms,  including  preventing  opsonization  by blocking complement fixation to the bacterial cell wall.

CHUNK 8
============================================================
NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS AND PATHOLOGY
A number of additional cellular products appear to facilitate direct spread of the invading organism through tissue planes and bacteremia can result in hematogenous dissemination. Some strains have the capacity to elaborate pyrogenic exotoxins that may act as 'superantigens', leading to polyclonal proliferation of subsets of T lymphocytes, massive cytokine production and shock [7].
Antibodies against Group A Streptococcus proteins (in particular antibodies against serotype-specific epitopes on the M protein) are important in providing protection against subsequent infection. However, aberrant immune responses to otherwise benign Group A Streptococcus pharyngitis or impetigo can result in the immune-mediated manifestations, acute rheumatic fever and acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. In acute rheumatic fever, cross-reactive antibodies are thought to arise in genetically predisposed individuals infected with rheumatogenic Group A Streptococcus strains. These strains elicit immune responses to antigens with a similarity between epitopes on the M protein and certain host proteins contained within endocardial, synovium and neural tissues.

============================================================
CLINICAL FEATURES
Group A Streptococcus pharyngitis may be mild or associated with high fever,  tender  anterior  cervical  lymphadenopathy,  tonsillar  exudates and raised peripheral white cell count. Symptoms usually resolve after 3-5  days,  although  suppurative  complications  (which  are  now uncommon in industrialized settings) include peritonsillar and retropharyngeal  abscess,  suppurative  lymphadenitis,  otitis  media,  mastoiditis and  meningitis. Non-suppurative  complications  include scarlet fever, acute rheumatic fever or acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Scarlet fever is characterized by a diffuse blanching rash that spreads from the chest to the abdomen and extremities leaving a  sandpaper-like  texture  to  the  skin.  Desquamation  of  the  fingers, toes, groin and axilla occurs one or more weeks later. The tongue is frequently coated in a white film (white strawberry tongue) that eventually gives way to a beefy red appearance (red strawberry tongue). While most cases are benign, scarlet fever was often lethal in the preantibiotic era. Many cases likely represented what would be regarded today as streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS).
In simple impetigo, infection is confined to the epidermis with the formation of superficial crusted lesions on the face or other exposed body  parts.  In  tropical  and  impoverished  settings  'pyodermatous' lesions may be pustular and ulcerative. Children are usually afebrile and otherwise well, although resolution of pyoderma may take many days and result in scarring. Erysipelas, which typically affects the face or  an  extremity,  is  a  painful  infection  of  the  dermis  resulting  in  a clearly  demarcated  red  and  raised  area  of  inflammation  and  often formation of superficial bullae. Cellulitis involves the deeper subcutaneous tissues  causing  a  more  diffuse  and  less  clearly  demarcated area of inflammation. Infection of the draining lymphatic tracts (lymphangitis) results in tender linear streaks extending from the site of infection. Unlike impetigo, cellulitis and erysipelas are usually associated with fever and systemic toxicity.

CLINICAL FEATURES
Necrotizing fasciitis is a rapidly progressing infection of the subcutaneous  fat,  the  superficial  fascia  and  deeper  structures,  including muscle. Shock, multi-organ failure and death may ensue within hours

or days of onset. Initially, the overlying skin is relatively spared and severe  escalating  pain  may  be  disproportionate to  clinical findings. The skin subsequently becomes violaceous and bullae may form and then slough. STSS is characteristically associated with Group A Streptococcus necrotizing  fasciitis,  although  it  may  arise  in  the  setting  of other invasive Group A Streptococcus infections. The case definition of STSS  requires  the  confirmation  of  Group  A Streptococcus infection, along  with  hypotension  and  two  or  more  features  of  multi-organ involvement: rash, coagulopathy, respiratory distress syndrome, renal failure or hepatic impairment [8].

============================================================
CHUNK 11
============================================================
CLINICAL FEATURES
Otitis  media,  retropharyngeal  and  peritonsillar  abscess,  sinusitis, meningitis, pneumonia, bacteremia and endocarditis may arise either as a complication of tonsillopharyngitis, following surgery or trauma (including burns), following varicella infection, or without apparent antecedent. Historically, outbreaks of Group A Streptococcus pneumonia were reported among previously healthy adults, although more recent reports have described the highest risk amongst the elderly and those  with  underlying  medical  conditions;  infection  in  these  individuals is often associated with high case fatality [9]. A viral prodrome is often reported, although the onset of fever, chest pain and dyspnea is  characteristically rapid. Group A Streptococcus pneumonia may be necrotizing with pleural effusions frequently present early and early complications include lung abscess formation, mediastinitis and pericarditis. Group A Streptococcus is an uncommon cause of meningitis in children and adults, with most reports arising in individuals with a pre-existing focus of Group A Streptococcus infection (e.g. pharyngitis, otitis media) or with other risk factors (e.g. skull defect or postcranial surgery) [10]. Puerperal sepsis caused by Group A Streptococcus was a frequent cause of death in the pre-antibiotic era with outbreaks resulting  from  nosocomial  transmission.  A  study  in  four  tropical developing countries (Papua New Guinea, Ethiopia, The Gambia and The Philippines) during the 1990s found that Group A Streptococcus was one of the three leading causes of bacteremia in children aged < 90 days, suggesting that Group A Streptococcus puerperal sepsis and septic abortion remain common in less developed, tropical countries [1 1]. Unlike Group B Streptococcus , Group A Streptococcus more commonly affects the mother than the infant, manifesting as post-partum endometritis, peritonitis, septic  thrombophlebitis  or  bacteremia without focus [12]. However, chorioamnionitis and neonatal sepsis are also reported.

CLINICAL FEATURES
Acute  rheumatic  fever  is  characterized  by  various  combinations  of fever, polyarthritis or arthralgias, carditis, characteristic rash (erythema marginatum), chorea and subcutaneous nodules [13] (Table 36-3). Chorea and insidious carditis can occur as a manifestation of acute rheumatic fever in the absence of other features. Severe or recurrent episodes of acute rheumatic fever may result in progressive damage to  the  mitral  valve  (and  sometimes  the  aortic  valve)  resulting  in incompetence and progressive heart failure (rheumatic heart disease). Over several years, the valve may eventually become stenotic. Acute post-streptococcal  glomerulonephritis  can  occur  1-2  weeks  after
throat infection or a few weeks after Group A Streptococcus skin infection.  The  features  are  hematuria  (microscopic  or  gross),  edema (which may be most evident peri-orbitally) and hypertension. Severe cases can also be complicated by encephalopathy. The illness is generally benign in childhood, but there may be an appreciable mortality among adults as a result of renal and congestive cardiac failure. Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) is a term used to describe some children with tic or obsessive compulsive disorders in whom symptoms appear to develop or worsen following Group A Streptococcus infection. The existence of PANDAS is controversial [14]. Post-streptococcal reactive arthritis describes a syndrome of polyarthritis that differs from acute rheumatic fever by affecting a range of smaller joints, being relatively resistant  to  anti-inflammatory  treatment  and  not  being  associated with carditis, although cases of acute rheumatic fever have been misdiagnosed as post-streptococcal reactive arthritis [15, 16].

Viruses  account  for  most  episodes  of  acute  pharyngitis  in  all  age groups. Group A Streptococcus is isolated in only 20-40% of cases of exudative pharyngitis in school-aged children and an even lower proportion  of  cases  in  younger  children  and  adults.  Recovery  of  the organism may not represent infection, but colonization. The distinguishing  features  of  Group  A Streptococcus pharyngitis  and  scarlet fever, and differential diagnoses, are detailed in Table 36-2.
Staphylococcus  aureus is  a  major  cause  of  community-acquired  pyogenic infection and an important differential diagnosis for invasive
Group A Streptococcus infection, especially for skin and osteoarticular infections and necrotizing pneumonia. The features which may help to  distinguish  Group  A Streptococcus from S.  aureus and  other  skin infections are listed in Table 36-2. In addition, a form of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) may complicate S. aureus infection, and shares many features with STSS with the exception that it is more frequently associated with colonization rather than bacteremia or severe underlying infection.
Invasive infections resulting from trauma or bites, exposure to water or soil, or involving immunocompromised hosts (including diabetic foot infections) may be caused by a more expanded array of pathogens and therefore require broader empirical therapy and heightened efforts to obtain a microbiologic diagnosis [17].

Acute  rheumatic  fever  is  the  most common cause of chorea in most populations with a high incidence of acute rheumatic fever-particularly those in tropical, lessdeveloped countries-and can occur in the absence of other features of acute rheumatic fever or serologic evidence of Group A Streptococcus infection.  However,  chorea  may  also  be  a  manifestation  of systemic  lupus  erythematosus,  neurovascular  disease,  drugs,  thyrotoxicosis, Wilson's disease and a number of genetic neurodegenerative diseases that  must be considered, especially  where acute rheumatic fever is uncommon.

zones of beta-hemolysis on blood agar. Other beta-hemolytic streptococci may colonize the oropharynx (e.g. Group C and G streptococci),  and  differentiation  requires  the  demonstration  of  growth inhibition by bacitracin or the use of commercially available, groupspecific antigen detection kits. Rapid diagnostic tests have been developed to allow clinicians to reliably distinguish Group A Streptococcus from viral pharyngitis at the point of care. Evaluations of these tests suggested  variable sensitivity of  earlier  generation  kits  (~85%), but improved sensitivity of later-generation optical immunoassay-based kits and good specificity.
Group A Streptococcus cellulitis  and  erysipelas are  clinical  diagnoses that  are  only  occasionally  confirmed  by  positive  blood  cultures. Culture of percutaneous aspirates is helpful if positive, but is usually negative. The clinical suspicion of necrotizing fasciitis or myonecrosis must be confirmed promptly by the demonstration of nonviable tissue  at  surgery.  Imaging  results  are  frequently  nondefinitive  and may inadvertently delay the diagnosis and institution of appropriate treatment.  Group  A Streptococcus can  usually  be  cultured  from oper  ative specimens, if not from blood in patients with necrotizing fasciitis.
The diagnosis of a primary episode of acute rheumatic fever is based on the most recent version of the Jones' criteria-currently the 1992 version (Table 36-3). These clinical and investigational criteria have been repeatedly revised since the original 1944 version to maintain their positive predictive value in settings where incidence is decreasing. As a result, some high-burden settings have chosen to modify the revised criteria to retain their sensitivity and negative predictive value [18].
In acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, activation of the alternative complement pathway results in a depressed C3 level (usually with a normal C4) that resolves after several weeks. Diagnosis generally rests on the presence of signs and symptoms, together with serologic  evidence  of  recent  Group  A Streptococcus infection  and  a compatible complement profile. Biopsy is reserved for atypical features,  such  as  anuria  or  failure  of  renal  function,  hypertension  or depressed complement that does not improve after several weeks.

TREATMENT
Penicillin remains the antibiotic of choice for most Group A Streptococcus infections. Group A Streptococcus remains universally sensitive to penicillin and, while treatment failures occur, they invariably relate to  lack  of in  vivo efficacy  rather  than in  vitro non-susceptibility.  As penicillins target cell wall synthesis, they may be less effective in the stationary phase of bacterial growth as they may occur in severe infections  complicated  by  large  bacterial  loads  [19].  However,  even  in instances where alternative antibiotics may be preferred because of differing mechanisms of action, they are generally used as an adjunct to-rather than in replacement of-penicillin therapy. Erythromycin and the newer macrolides have been used for Group A Streptococcus disease where individuals have immediate hypersensitivity to penicillin. Macrolide resistance is common in some settings and can arise abruptly, apparently related to the population level of macrolide consumption. Some mutations confer resistance to both macrolides and clindamycin, but these remain uncommon.
The use of antibiotics for the routine treatment of Group A Streptococcus pharyngitis is contentious because of the usually self-limiting nature  of  the  illness.  Studies  suggest  that  treatment  reduces  the average duration of sore throat by 16 hours and decreases the risk of rheumatic  fever  and  otitis  media  by  around  70%,  and  the  risk  of peritonsillar abscess by around 85% [20]. In low-incidence settings, the numbers needed to treat to prevent complications is likely to be very large, so the main aim of antibiotic treatment, if chosen to be used, is alleviation of symptoms and shortening of the duration of illness. However, antibiotic treatment of Group A Streptococcus pharyngitis  is  essential  in  populations  with  a  high  incidence  of  acute rheumatic  fever  and,  if  diagnostic  facilities  are  limited,  empirical treatment of all sore throat cases may be justified. There is little evidence  that  antibiotics  reduce  the  risk  of  subsequent  acute  poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.

============================================================
CHUNK 31
============================================================
TREATMENT
Treatment recommendations are detailed in Table 36-4. Ten days of twice-daily oral penicillin V or a single dose of intramuscular benzathine pencillin G are the preferred treatment for Group A Streptococcus pharyngitis, although once-daily oral amoxicillin appears to be effective  for  symptom  resolution  and  Group  A Streptococcus eradication [21].  Short  courses  (up  to  5  days)  of  macrolides  and  some  cephalosporins have been shown to have equivalent clinical and short-term microbiologic cure rates, but the risk of late microbiologic failure may be higher. There are insufficient data regarding the efficacy of shortcourse  or  non-penicillin  regimens  in  preventing  acute  rheumatic fever. Treatment of impetigo may be with oral or topical antibioticsoptions are given in Table 36-4.
Penicillin is the treatment of choice for invasive infection where Group A Streptococcus is confirmed or highly likely (e.g. erysipelas or perianal cellulitis).  Because  of  the  narrow  spectrum  of  penicillin,  empirical treatment prior to microbiologic confirmation is generally with one or more alternative antimicrobials. For example,  an anti-staphylococcal penicillin or a first-generation cephalosporin is required to cover both Group A Streptococcus and S. aureus in cellulitis (see Table 36-4). Where methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is prevalent, clindamycin may be an acceptable alternative if prevailing MRSA strains are susceptible. Suppurative  diseases  frequently  seen  as  complications  of  Group  A Streptococcus infection (e.g. peritonsillar abscess) may also be caused by organisms other than Group A Streptococcus .
As  necrotizing  soft  tissue  infections  may  be  polymicrobial,  broadspectrum cover (e.g. with a carbapenem) is recommended until the microbiologic cause is confirmed.

============================================================
CHUNK 32
============================================================
TREATMENT
Urgent and aggressive debridement of nonviable tissues has been the cornerstone of management of Group A Streptococcus necrotizing fasciitis, along with intensive supportive care and antibiotics. However, some authorities have suggested that a less aggressive approach may be acceptable if antibiotics and adjunctive therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) are instituted early [22]. Clindamycin is recommended as an adjunct  to  penicillin  for  the  treatment  of  severe invasive  Group  A Streptococcus disease,  including  necrotizing  infections, during the first few days of treatment-this is supported by the superior activity of clindamycin over penicillin in animal models [19]. However, penicillin should always be given unless there is a history of hypersensitivity. Although supportive data are limited, administration of 1 or 2 doses of IVIG early in the course of STSS is widely recommended. A multicenter, randomized, controlled trial revealed a trend toward a reduction in mortality among recipients, but the study was terminated early because of slow recruitment [23]. IVIG is also recommended by some as adjunctive treatment in severe invasive Group A Streptococcus infections, even in the absence of toxic shock.

TREATMENT
Management of acute rheumatic fever is primarily symptomatic. Penicillin  is  generally  given  to  eradicate  colonization,  although  acute infection has usually passed by the time symptoms of acute rheumatic fever develop. Salicylates are used to relieve fever and the pain from arthritis  that  is  often  severe.  Where  necessary,  cardiac  failure  is managed with  diuretics  and  angiotensin-converting  enzyme  (ACE) inhibitors.  Steroids  are  sometimes  used  in  cases  of  severe  carditis, although  there  is  no  evidence  that  they  improve  the  long-term outcome in RHD. Mitral valve repair, balloon valvuloplasty, or valve replacement may be required to manage patients with severe valve disease in rheumatic heart disease.
Management of acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is based on control of hypertension with fluid restriction and use of a loop diuretic such as furosemide. ACE inhibitors may also be needed as an adjunct. Dialysis is occasionally required to manage severe hyperkalemia or symptomatic uremia.
Contacts  of  patients  with  Group  A Streptococcus infection  may  be colonized with the  same  Group  A Streptococcus strain,  but  primary prophylaxis  of  contacts  is  rarely  indicated  for  simple  Group  A Streptococcus pharyngitis.  Even  for  contacts  of  severe  invasive  infections,  it  is  estimated  that  around  2000  contacts  would  need  to receive  prophylaxis  in  order  to  avoid  a  single,  severe  infectionopinion  on  the  value  of  treating  contacts  is  divided  [24].  If  prophylactic  treatment  of  contacts  is  attempted,  regimens  combining rifampin  with  penicillin,  or  using  alternative  antibiotics  such  as cephalosporins  or  azithromycin,  are  usually  recommended  as  a result  of  the  increasing  failures  of  penicillin  alone  in  eradicating carriage.
However, regular secondary prophylaxis is recommended for all children and adults with previous acute rheumatic fever or established rheumatic heart disease. Monthly intramuscular benzathine penicillin G is  central  to  the  management  of  children  and  adults  with  acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease (see Table 36-4).

TREATMENT
During outbreaks of acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis secondary to Group A Streptococcus pyoderma, community-based treatment  of  infected  individuals  and  their  contacts  with  benzathine penicillin  G  appears  to  decrease  the  transmission  of  acute  poststreptococcal  glomerulonephritis-producing  Group  A Streptococcus strains. In addition to treating infected individuals, reducing the transmission of Group A Streptococcus pyoderma in resource-limited settings is likely to require skin hygiene measures, including the control of scabies.
After  a  century  of  research,  the  development  of  a  vaccine  against Group A Streptococcus disease  is  at  last  showing  promise.  The  most advanced of the current candidates is a multivalent vaccine including 26 of the most common Group A Streptococcus emm types encountered in North America and Europe. Unfortunately, there is a limited match of  these  strains  with  prevalent emm types  in  Africa  and  the Pacific,  where emm types  are  more  variable  [25].  Other  candidate vaccines, containing antigens conserved among most, or all, Group A Streptococcus strains, are approaching clinical trials.
