INTRODUCTION
Zika virus, a single-stranded RNA virus of the Flaviviridae family, genus Flavivirus, originally isolated in Africa, gained worldwide attention in 2015 and 2016 when massive outbreaks in Brazil were followed by a marked increase in infants born with severe microcephaly  and  congenital  abnormalities.  The  virus  subsequently spread throughout the Americas. Intense research activities have answered key questions about Zika virus, its spread, and control, but gaps in knowledge remain.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Zika  virus,  {rst  isolated  from  a  sentinel  rhesus  monkey  in  the Zika forest  in  Uganda  in  1947,  was  found  in  the  same  area  in 1948 in Aedes mosquitoes. The {rst human infection was identi{ed in the 1950s. In subsequent decades it was identi{ed sporadically in  animals  and in  mild  human infections in Africa and Asia.  In 2007 Zika virus caused a large outbreak on Yap Island (western Paci{c), initially thought to be caused by dengue virus; the virus was estimated to infect 70% of the population. 1 It subsequently caused a major outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013 to 2014. 2 Zika virus was {rst associated with recognized outbreaks in Brazil in 2015, but recent analyses using sequencing, molecular mapping, and modeling suggest Zika reached the Americas as early as 2013, with cryptic transmission before the disease was detected. 3-5 From northeast Brazil the virus spread to the Caribbean, Central America, and throughout South America (except Chile and Uruguay where local vector transmission has not been documented); many countries in Asia and Africa have also documented transmission 6 (Fig. 36.3.1). Local vector transmission in the continental United States  has occurred in Florida and T exas (226 cases as of December 2017; https://www.cdc.gov/zika).  A  2016  outbreak  in  Singapore  (455 cases con{rmed) shows the potential for outbreaks in many tropical and sub-tropical regions where competent mosquito vectors are present and ecoclimatic conditions are favorable. 7

TRANSMISSION
Infection is spread primarily via infected female mosquitoes, with A. aegypti being the primary vector in the Americas. A. albopictus, which can survive in more temperate areas, can also transmit Zika virus. These mosquito vectors infest most sub-tropical and tropical regions globally, including urban areas (areas with a total population of about 3.6 billion people). Seasonality of transmission is linked to local temperature and rainfall patterns. The same mosquitoes can also transmit dengue and chikungunya (and co-transmission can occur). In the past 10 years, Zika transmission has been reported from at least 84 countries. 6 Zika virus can be transmitted vertically in A. aegypti mosquitoes. The transmission cycle in the Americas has been person-mosquito-person. It is not known whether the virus will become established in an animal reservoir host in the Americas,  as  occurs  in  Africa,  where  the  virus  infected  animal hosts and occasionally spilled over into the human population-at least  in  the  past. 8 The  growth  of  urban  areas  infested  with A. aegypti provides a suitable environment for transmission.
Of the 5413 Zika virus disease cases (excluding congenital cases) reported in the United States for January 2015 to December 6, 2017, 95% were travel related and 99% were vector borne. Of the 51 cases that were not vector borne, 94% were attributed to sexual transmission, 1 due to laboratory transmission, and 1 unknown route (https://www.cdc.gov/zika).

============================================================
CHUNK 6
============================================================
TRANSMISSION
Virus can be found in blood, urine, saliva, semen, and vaginal or  cervical  secretions.  Sexual  transmission  can  occur  during  or after symptomatic or asymptomatic infection from male to female, male to male, and female to male (possibly via oral sex). 9 Virus is found in vaginal secretions, and viral RNA has been documented in semen up to 188 days after infection and infectious virus up to 69 days. In a longitudinal assessment of Zika virus RNA in body |uids, 95% of men had cleared the virus from semen after about 3 months. 10 In areas infested with competent vectors, it is dif{cult to assess what percentage is vector borne and how much infection is  sexually transmitted. Zika virus particles and RNA have been found in breast milk, but transmission via breastfeeding has not been documented to date. Virus persists longer in whole blood than in plasma, which may be relevant for diagnosis and in testing blood or tissue donations for transfusion/transplantation. T ransmission via platelet transfusion was reported from Brazil, 11  and RNA Zika-positive asymptomatic donors were identi{ed in Florida and Texas in the United States. 12 Screening of blood donors in Puerto Rico during an outbreak on the island found 1.1% viremic. 13

PATHOGENESIS AND PATHOLOGY
Perinatal transmission of Zika virus was reported to occur in the French Polynesia outbreak in 2013 to 2014, but the association between Zika virus and microcephaly was not recognized until the observations had been made in Brazil and a retrospective study was done in 2016 based on serologic and surveillance data. 14 Zika virus can infect the placenta, reach the developing fetus, and can target neural precursors. Maternal infection disrupts fetal central nervous  system  development  and  causes  intrauterine  growth retardation  and  fetal  loss.  Infection  is  associated  with  cortical malformations  and  intra-cranial  calci{cations.  The  congenital malformations include ventriculomegaly, dystrophic calci{cations, severe cortical neuronal depletion, decreased brain weight, congenital contractures, marked early hypertonia with symptoms of extrapyramidal involvement, and ocular and hearing problems. 15-17

CLINICAL FEATURES
Zika virus  seroprevalence  studies  in  Yap  and  French  Polynesia estimated that asymptomatic infections ranged from 29% to 80%. 1,19 Clinical syndromes among residents from outbreak areas such as Yap, French Polynesia, Brazil, and Puerto Rico and returned infected travelers  appeared  to  be  alike 1,2,7,20-23 (T able  36.3.1).  The  most frequently  reported  symptoms  were  rash  (74%-100%),  fever, arthritis  and/or  arthralgia,  myalgia,  conjunctivitis,  and  fatigue. The  most  common  {nding,  rash,  was  usually  described  as
maculopapular. 1,2,7,20-23 Pruritus was reported from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,  and  travelers  evaluated  in  the  GeoSentinel  Surveillance Network, but not from other series. 1,2,7,20-23 Fatigue was frequently reported  from  French  Polynesia  and  Brazil  (78%  and  73%, respectively) 2,20 but  possibly  not  solicited  or  recorded  in  some other series. Proportions with retro-orbital pain or edema/swelling were  variable.  Presenting  symptoms  among  children  infected postnatally  resembled  those  in  adults,  mainly  with  rash,  fever, conjunctivitis, and arthralgia. 7,24
Rarely, some severe complications in adults have been attributed to  Zika  virus  infection,  particularly  neurologic  disorders  (GBS, myelitis,  demyelinating  polyneuropathy,  meningoencephalitis), autoimmune  disorder,  and  immune-mediated  thrombocytopenia. 23,25-27 GBS occurred in about 1/4000 Zika infections in studies from French Polynesia and Brazil, at least six times that of the global baseline incidence; males had higher risk. 25,27 Patients with Zika-associated  GBS or encephalitis have died  (6%),  and  51% have chronic pain. 27 As described earlier, congenital Zika syndrome resulting  from  infection  during  pregnancy  is  associated  with

devastating abnormalities in the newborn and has the most signi{cant impact.

PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
During acute infection with Zika virus, laboratory {ndings may reveal  leukopenia,  lymphopenia,  thrombocytopenia,  and  less frequently, leukocytosis. C-reactive protein may be mildly elevated, as well as transaminases.
Recommendations  for  con{rmatory  Zika  virus  testing  vary among countries and have evolved over the course  of its rapid spread  in  the  Americas.  In  the  United  States  testing  has  been constrained  by  availability  of  diagnostic  tests  and  laboratory capability. The guidelines consider the pregnancy status of the patient or partner, exposure history, and symptoms, with strongest focus on pregnant women 28,29 (Fig. 36.3.2).
De{nitive  Zika diagnosis can be made  by  detection of viral RNA during acute infection by reverse transcription polymerase

These  molecular  tests can  be  performed  on  serum,  whole  blood,  or  urine  up  to  2 weeks after symptom onset; in pregnant women, NATs may be performed up to 12 weeks after symptom onset or exposure 28,29 (see Fig. 36.3.2).

============================================================
PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Detection of Zika IgM by IgM-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay  (MAC-ELISA)  followed  by  con{rmation  with plaque  reduction  neutralization  test  (PRNT) can  also  establish the diagnosis. Zika IgM may be reactive when performed 2 to 12 weeks after exposure, but can persist longer. Unfortunately, Zika serology cross-reacts with other |aviviruses, and PRNT, which is needed to differentiate among the |aviviruses, is labor intensive, time consuming, and challenging to interpret. Unlike dengue and chikungunya, where IgG is available to assess past infection and immunity, Zika IgG is not available in the United States.
There are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-licensed diagnostic tests for the diagnosis of Zika virus infection, but several diagnostic tests are available under Emergency Use Authorization. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state laboratories  perform  testing  with  PCR  or  IgM,  and  the  CDC performs PRNT. In October 2017, the FDA approved the {rst Zika test for screening blood donations.
The main differential diagnoses for Zika virus infection are other viruses transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, especially dengue (also a |avivirus) and chikungunya (an alphavirus). Because Zika, dengue, and chikungunya cause similar symptoms and each may have important consequences, distinguishing between the three arboviruses by molecular test or serology followed by PRNT is desirable. Other diagnoses that may resemble Zika virus infections include rubeola, rubella, parvovirus, West Nile virus, and many other viruses, as well as leptospirosis, rickettsiosis, and malaria.

============================================================
TREATMENT AND PREVENTION
Treatment for the typical uncomplicated Zika virus infection aims to provide symptomatic relief. There is no known speci{c medication targeting Zika virus. However, research is underway to assess the  effect  of  some  existing  drugs  on  Zika  virus.  Preliminary investigations have identi{ed  some candidate drugs: emricasan, niclosamide,  sofosbuvir,  chloroquine,  azithromycin,  and  bovine
lactoferrin. 9 Further evaluation is needed regarding their potential activity against Zika virus.
Currently there is no vaccine to prevent Zika virus infection but multiple candidate vaccines are under development and testing. Therefore avoidance of mosquito bites and sexual transmission is fundamental in prevention. The impact of Zika virus infection is most consequential during pregnancy; thus preventing infection in  pregnant  women  is  crucial.  The  key  messages  for  pregnant women, their partners, and persons planning conception include the following: avoid travel to areas with active Zika virus transmission, take measures to avoid mosquito bites, and practice safe sex to reduce risk from sexual transmission. In areas with active Zika virus transmission, vector control measures are essential. Updated epidemiology and testing recommendations on the CDC website (www.cdc.gov/zika) are valuable in guiding clinical practice.
