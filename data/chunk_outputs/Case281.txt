INTRODUCTION
The  presence  of  spiral,  gram-negative  bacteria  on  the  human gastric mucosa was recognized in the late 19th century and related to peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. In 1983 Warren and Marshall were the {rst to successfully culture Helicobacter pylori from gastric biopsy samples. Through self-ingestion, they con{rmed that  this  bacterium  caused  gastro-duodenal  disorders. 1 T oday, H. pylori is known to be the main cause of chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer  disease,  gastric  carcinoma,  and  gastric  mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, and has been declared by the World Health Organization (WHO), as a class I carcinogen. It  is  estimated  that  more  than half of the world's population  is colonized with H. pylori, with the vast majority becoming infected in childhood.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
H. pylori is one of the world's most common bacterial infections, if not the most common (Fig. 45.1). The bacterium is present in human populations throughout the world, and phylogeographic studies  indicate  that  humans  have  been  colonized  by H.  pylori since their ancestral migration from east Africa more than 50,000 years ago. There are substantial differences in its prevalence, both within  and  between  countries. 2 In  industrialized  countries,  the overall prevalence of H. pylori generally varies between 30% and 40% and increases with age. This is related to an age-cohort effect with decreasing infection rates in subsequent generations because of  improved  hygiene  and  housing  conditions.  In  developing countries, however, H. pylori prevalence rises rapidly during the {rst  5  years  of  life,  often  to  80%  or  more,  and  then  remains constant thereafter. This indicates that H. pylori is mostly acquired early in childhood. 3 Once acquired, colonization persists throughout life in the absence of antibiotic therapy. The infection rate is thus

H.  pylori has  a  narrow  host  range  and  is  almost  exclusively found  in  humans.  The  exact  mechanisms  whereby H.  pylori is acquired  are  largely  unknown.  New  infections  are  thought  to occur as a consequence of direct human-to-human transmission, either via the oral-oral or fecal-oral route, or both. 1

============================================================
NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
H. pylori is  a  spiral,  gram-negative bacterium with |agella. It is microaerophilic, requiring low levels of oxygen. Although its natural habitat is the acidic gastric lumen and it can resist brief exposure to pH levels below 4, growth only occurs at a pH between 5.5 and 8.0. Intra-gastric survival occurs within the protective mucus layer, with local acid buffering by the high bacterial urease activity. The  associated  gastritis  also  impairs  acid  production  and  thus enhances bacterial survival. 1

============================================================
CHUNK 6
============================================================
Pathogenesis
H. pylori colonization induces chronic active gastritis in virtually all infected subjects. Colonization is accompanied by a persistent immune response, but this is ineffective in clearing the bacterium. Only a minority of colonized subjects develop overt disease, in particular,  peptic  ulcer  disease  and  gastric  cancer.  The  risk  of disease development in the presence of H. pylori is  related  to  a combination of factors, including bacterial strain differences, host susceptibility, and environmental factors. H. pylori exhibits a high level of genetic diversity that translates into major differences in virulence. T wo main virulence factors are the cagA and vacA genes. The cagA pathogenicity island is present in some 40% to 60% of strains, and is strongly associated with the development of peptic ulcers, as well as gastric cancer. The vacA gene is present in all strains, but has polymorphisms that translate into differences of expression. Host susceptibility is in|uenced by genetic polymorphisms in various cytokine genes that affect the level and pro{le of  the  in|ammatory  response  to  colonization  with H.  pylori . 5 Furthermore, environmental factors play a role in H. pylori -related pathogenesis. Smoking increases the risk of ulcers, and diets high in salt and low in antioxidants and vitamin C increase cancer risk.
Finally, the pattern of H. pylori colonization also determines disease  risk.  Subjects  with  normal-to-high  acid  output  have  an antral-predominant  gastritis  and  are  most  at  risk  for  duodenal ulceration. Subjects with low acid output demonstrate pan-gastritis and are most at risk for gastric ulceration and cancer. 1,6

CHUNK 7
============================================================
CLINICAL FEATURES
H.  pylori infection  is  associated  with  chronic  gastritis,  peptic ulcer disease, distal gastric adenocarcinoma, gastric MAL T lymphoma,  and  Ménétrier's  disease  (pre-malignant  hypertrophic gastropathy).

============================================================
CHUNK 8
============================================================
Gastritis
Colonization with H. pylori in  the  {rst weeks can be associated with acute gastritis, which can be accompanied by transient, nonspeci{c dyspepsia symptoms, such as fullness, nausea, and vomiting. The majority of subjects do not clear the infection, despite the humoral and cellular response. They continue to develop persistent colonization with chronic active gastritis. 1

============================================================
CHUNK 9
============================================================
Peptic Ulcer Disease
It is estimated that approximately 20% of H. pylori -positive subjects develop peptic ulcer disease during their lifetime, and those with an ulcer have a more than 50% risk for recurrent ulcer disease in  the  years  thereafter.  This  strong  association  exists  for  both duodenal  ulcers  and  gastric  ulcers. 1,7 Ulcers  may  be  associated with intestinal bleeding and perforation and, in some cases, stricture formation. Eradication of H. pylori prevents recurrence of ulcers and their complications in most patients, unless they have a second risk factor for ulceration, in particular, use of non-steroidal anti-

============================================================
Gastric Cancer
H.  pylori infection  is  the  starting  point  in  a  cancer-associated cascade  that  passes  through  the  stages  of  chronic  gastritis, atrophic gastritis, intestinal  metaplasia, and dysplasia to cancer. H.  pylori may  initiate  this  process  by  causing  chronic  cellular proliferation,  increasing  the  likelihood  of  mutagenic  processes in  the  presence  of  carcinogenic  substances.  Although  development of the initial stages of this progressive cascade (in particular, atrophic  gastritis  and  intestinal  metaplasia)  are  common  in H. pylori -positive individuals, only 1% to 2% of H. pylori -infected patients eventually develop gastric carcinoma as a result of lifelong infection. 6-10

============================================================
Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue Lymphoma
Healthy  gastric  mucosa  normally  does  not  contain  lymphoid follicles,  but  lymphocytes  are  inevitably  present  in  the  gastric mucosa  in  all H.  pylori -positive  individuals.  In  rare  cases,  this eventually leads to the development of MALT B-cell lymphomas

(usually  low  grade).  Close  to  100%  of  patients  with  low-grade gastric  MAL T  lymphoma  have  evidence  of H.  pylori infection. H. pylori eradication is the primary treatment for these patients, as it leads to either partial or complete regression in more than 70% of patients. 7,10

CHUNK 12
============================================================
Ménétrier's Disease
Ménétrier's disease, also called hypertrophic gastropathy, is  a  rare condition of unknown etiology. However, a majority have evidence of H.  pylori infection;  successful  eradication  can  lead  to  major improvement  of  symptoms  and  should  therefore  always  be considered. 7,10

Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease
Although H. pylori has  been  clearly  demonstrated  as a  cause  of the earlier-mentioned diseases, discussion remains as to whether it  also  carries  potential  bene{cial  effects.  This  discussion,  in particular, focuses on the negative association between H. pylori colonization and the development of gastroesophageal re|ux disease 7,10,11

H. pylori Infection in Children
H. pylori infection in children may be associated with recurrent abdominal pain, iron de{ciency, and, during conditions of nutritional limitation, growth retardation; however, the incidence of peptic ulcer disease is lower than in adults. In contrast, reports suggest that H.  pylori protects  children  from  developing  asthma  and atopy. 3,7,10

============================================================
PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
H. pylori can be diagnosed by various methods, each with advantages  and  disadvantages.  Non-invasive  testing  is  recommended for  primary  screening  of  young  individuals  and  children  who present with upper abdominal complaints. These tests are based on the detection of H. pylori enzyme activity, antigen, or antibodies.  Invasive  testing  is  usually  reserved  for  patients  undergoing diagnostic or therapeutic upper intestinal endoscopy as part of a
broader evaluation, and involves sampling of mucosal tissue for evaluation of the presence of H. pylori through direct detection of  measuring  enzyme  activity.  As H.  pylori may  not  be  evenly spread throughout the stomach in infected individuals, multiple biopsy samples from various locations are required for optimal sensitivity. 10,12

============================================================
CHUNK 16
============================================================
Urea Breath Tests
Urea breath tests (UBT s) are based on the large urease production by all H. pylori strains. UBTs are very reliable, low-burden tests that have been validated both in adults and children. Fasting patients consume a small amount of either 14 C- or 13 C-labeled urea. Urease degrades urea,  releasing  labeled  carbon  dioxide  that  enters  the bloodstream via the gastric mucosa and can be detected in a breath sample. 13,14

============================================================
CHUNK 17
============================================================
Serology
Serum antibodies (especially IgG) against H. pylori can easily be detected. The  main disadvantage of  serology is  that  antibodies can still be detected for a considerable period after eradication of H.  pylori. Furthermore,  as  the  antigenic  properties  of H.  pylori strains vary between  countries,  the  tests  should  be  locally standardized. 13,14

============================================================
CHUNK 18
============================================================
Fecal Antigen Testing
H. pylori -speci{c antigens can be detected in diluted stool samples. This is an attractive test for use in small children, as obtaining breath  samples  can  be  dif{cult  and  serum  sampling  can  be burdensome. 13,14

============================================================
CHUNK 19
============================================================
Urine Antigen Testing
AntiH. pylori antibodies can be detected in urine samples as well. Currently this is not a generally applied method; however, recent data  seem  promising  for  this  easily  applicable,  non-invasive method. 13,14

============================================================
CHUNK 20
============================================================
Culture
In reference microbiologic laboratories, culturing of gastric biopsy specimens for 3 to 7 days at 37°C under micro-aerophilic conditions can be performed, enabling detection of H. pylori and determination of antimicrobial resistance. 14

============================================================
CHUNK 21
============================================================
Histology
H.  pylori can  be  identi{ed  by  hematoxylin-eosin  staining  and histopathologic examination of gastric biopsy specimens. When performed by an experienced pathologist, it is highly reliable and often considered the gold standard for diagnosing H. pylori. Special stains enhance detection, but are not necessary. 14

============================================================
CHUNK 22
============================================================
Rapid Urease Test
test, which is based on bacterial urease (also known as a CLO test [ Campylobacter -like organism test]). A gastric biopsy sample is placed in media with a pH-color indicator. Urea degradation is accompanied by a pH increase that is detected by a color change of an indicator. It is an easy and low-cost test, but also has the lowest sensitivity and speci{city of the invasive assays. 14

============================================================
Indications
Indications for treatment are still evolving (T able 45.1). Consensus exists  for  the  treatment  of  individuals  with H. pylori -associated peptic ulcer disease and gastric MAL T lymphoma. Treatment of individuals with non-ulcer dyspepsia is more controversial. Most authorities would treat H. pylori -infected individuals thought to be at increased risk of gastric carcinoma, including those with a family history of gastric cancer and those with gastric dysplasia. Individuals with Ménétrier' s disease and H. pylori should be treated. 10

============================================================
CHUNK 24
============================================================
Antimicrobials
In vitro, H. pylori is susceptible to most antimicrobials, but in vivo only a few antimicrobials can be used to cure infected patients. This  is  related  to  limited  drug  levels  within  the  gastric  mucus layer. Metronidazole, clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and tetracycline are the most widely used antimicrobial drugs used to treat individuals with H. pylori infection. None of the earlier-mentioned antibiotics is effective enough to eliminate H. pylori when given as monotherapy. Successful eradication of H. pylori requires a combination of drugs, consisting of two antibiotics in combination with an acid-suppressive drug. Current guidelines for the treatment of H. pylori are given in T able 45.2.
In general practice, 20% to 30% of the treatment regimens fail,  usually  because  of  insuf{cient  patient  compliance  or  the who fail treatment are usually re-treated with another antimicrobial combination (Table 45.2). 10,12,15
