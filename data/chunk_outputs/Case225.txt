INTRODUCTION
Animals may prove hazardous to humans through traumatic attacks (e.g. by large felines, bears, crocodiles, sharks, etc.), through poisoning after  their  flesh  has  been  ingested  (see  Chapters  133.1,  133.2), through envenoming and allergic hypersensitization (this chapter and Chapter 136) and through transmission of zoonotic infections-see 'Bats' (Chapter 134.6 and elsewhere in this book).

VENOMOUS BITES AND STINGS, AND ENVENOMING
Envenoming  (American/Australian:  'envenomation'),  as  distinct from poisoning, occurs when venoms secreted by specialized glands are injected through the victim's skin or applied to absorbent mucous membranes.  To  inject  their  venoms,  venomous  snakes  and  lizards have grooved or cannulated fangs or solid teeth; spiders have venom jaws (chelicerae); vampire bats, insectivorous mammals and leeches have solid teeth; male monotreme mammals (platypus and echidna) have  venomous spurs;  centipedes  have  modified  legs  (maxillipeds, forcipules or prehensors); insects, scorpions, ticks, fish and echinoderms (sea urchins etc.) have rigid, sharpened, barbed stings, spines,

Key features
- The many species of venomous ?sh that inhabit tropical and temperate oceans and rivers have stinging apparatus in their ?ns, gill covers or, in sting rays, at the base of the tail. Common causes of ?sh stings are weevers (Europe), sting rays (Americas and Amazon tributaries) and scorpion ?sh that are popular aquarium pets. Stone ?sh ( Synanceja ) are the most dangerous
- Cnidarians (coelenterates)-including jelly?sh, cubomedusoids, sea wasps, Portuguese-men-o'-war or bluebottles, stinging corals and sea anemones-envenom by ?ring numerous stinging hairs into the dermis, causing pain, weals and sometimes cardiovascular collapse
- Echinoderms (star?sh and sea urchins) have sharp venomous spines that can impale waders' feet
- Mollusks capable of causing fatal envenoming are cone shells and blue-ringed octopuses
- The pain of marine stings is relieved by hot (45°C) water. Antivenoms are manufactured for envenoming by scorpion ?sh and box jelly?sh
or hypostomes; echinoderms have venomous grapples (pedicellariae); cnidarians  (jellyfish,  coelenterates)  have  stinging  hairs  (cnidocytes, nematocysts);  octopuses  (cephalopods  mollusks)  have  venomous beaks; and cone shells (gastropod mollusks) impale their prey with a venom-filled radular tooth mounted on a harpoon-like proboscis. Some elapid snakes, scorpions, 'blister' beetles, millipedes and other arthropods can 'spit' or squirt their venoms-a largely defensive ploy.

============================================================
CHUNK 3
============================================================
Key features
Venoms are noxious substances secreted by specialized glands. They vary in  their  complexity  from simple  organic acids and phenols in some arthropod venoms, to complex mixtures of hundreds of different proteins (polypeptide toxins, enzymes, etc.) and smaller, pharmacologically-active molecules in snake venoms. Evolution has selected venoms and venom-administering organs to immobilize and digest animals' prey, to prevent blood clotting in the case of leeches, vampire bats and other 'blood sucking' species, and for defense. A few venom toxins are modified salivary gland secretions, but most venom genes originated from other organs through repeated episodes of gene duplication and gene recruitment.
Here,  the  venomous  animals  of  greatest  medical  importance  in human and veterinary medicine are selected for discussion: snakes, lizards, fish, arthropods, leeches and the aquatic cnidarians, mollusks and echinoderms.

============================================================
VENOMOUS FISH [1-3]
Although more than 1200 species of fish are thought to be venomous, only about 200 species can inflict dangerous stings. Rarely, fatal stings are  inflicted  by  cartilagenous  fish  (class  Chondrichthyes),  such  as sharks and dogfish (order Squaliformes); stingrays and mantas (order Rajiformes);  and  bony  fish  (superclass  Osteichthyes),  such  as  rayfinned fish (class Actinopterygii) of the orders Siluriformes (catfish), Perciformes [families Trachinidae (weever fish), Uranoscopidae (stargazers  or  stone-lifters)  and  others]  and  Scorpaeniformes  (scorpion fish, stonefish, lion fishSynanceja/Synanceia spp.) (Figs 134.1.1 and 134.1.2). Tropical oceans have the richest venomous fish fauna, but dangerous  species  also  occur  in  temperate  northern  waters.  Large rivers in South America, West Africa and Southeast Asia are inhabited by  freshwater  stingrays  ( Potamotrygon spp.)  (Fig.  134.1.3).  Venom glands are embedded in grooves in the spines or, in the case of stingrays,  lie  beneath  a  membrane  covering  the  long  barbed  precaudal spine.

============================================================
CHUNK 5
============================================================
INCIDENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY
Some years, hundreds of weever fish stings occur around the British coast and along the Adriatic coast. An estimated 1500 stings by rays and 300 stings by scorpion fish occur in the USA each year. Stings by freshwater  rays  are  common  in  the  Amazon  region.  Ornate,  but aggressive, Pterois and Dendrochirus spp. (lion, zebra, tiger, turkey or red fire fish) are popular aquarium pets. People wading near the shore

or coral reefs may tread upon well-camouflaged stonefish ( Synanceja spp.) lying partly covered by sea plants and anemones [1]. Stingrays lash their tails, usually impaling the ankle [2].

============================================================
CHUNK 6
============================================================
PREVENTION
Employing a shuffling gait when wading, avoiding the handling of living or dead fish, and keeping away from fish near tropical reefs all aid  in  prevention.  Footwear  protects  against  most  species,  except stingrays.

============================================================
CHUNK 7
============================================================
VENOM COMPOSITION
Stingray and weeverfish venoms contain peptides, enzymes, vasoactive  kinins,  5-hydroxytryptamine,  histamine  and  catecholamines. Venoms cause local necrosis and target cardiac, skeletal and smooth muscle  resulting  in  electrocardiogram  changes,  hypotension  and paralysis.

============================================================
CHUNK 8
============================================================
CLINICAL FEATURES [3]
Immediate sharp, agonizing pain is typical. Hot, painful, erythematous swelling extends up the stung limb and may persist for days and be complicated by necrosis and secondary infection by marine Vibrio spp. (such as Vibrio  vulnificus )  and  freshwater Aeromonas hydrophila, particularly if the spine is left in the wound. Stingray spines (up to 30 cm  long)  can  cause  severe  lacerating  and  penetrating  wounds, sometimes with fatal results.
Stings by rays or Scorpaenidae (scorpion and stonefish) may cause nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhea,  sweating  and  hypersalivation,  cardiac arrhythmias, hypotension, respiratory distress, neurologic signs and generalized convulsions. However, fatalities are very rare.

============================================================
CHUNK 9
============================================================
TREATMENT
Treatment is common to all wounds caused by venomous fish and includes: (i) pain relief; (ii) neutralizing effects of venom; (iii) prevention of secondary infection; and (iv) supportive care of systemic symptoms.  Immersion  of  the  stung  part  in  uncomfortably  hot,  but  not scalding, water (less than 45°C) relieves pain and neutralizes venom. Alternatively,  inject  local  anesthetic  as  a  ring  block  or  local  nerve block. The barbed venomous spine, its covering membrane and other foreign  material  should  be  removed  as  soon  as  possible.  Systemic effects  are  treated  symptomatically.  Cardiopulmonary  resuscitation may  be  required  on  the  beach.  In  Australia,  CSL  (Melbourne, Australia) manufacture an antivenom specific for Synanceja trachynis, Synanceja  verrucosa ,  and Synanceja  horridus which  has  paraspecific activity against venoms of North American scorpion fish ( Scorpaena guttata ) and some other Scorpaenidae. Doxycycline or co-trimoxazole covers Vibrio and Aeromonas spp.

============================================================
CNIDARIANS HCOELENTERATESE
Cnidarian  (Jellyfish,  Cubomedusoids,  Sea  Wasps,  Portuguese-MenO'-War or Bluebottles, Hydroids, Stinging Corals, Sea Anemones, etc.) tentacles are armed with millions of stinging capsules (nematocysts) which,  triggered  by  contact  or  chemicals,  evert  stinging  hairs  that penetrate the skin, producing lines of painful, irritant weals. Venoms contain peptides and other vasoactive compounds provoking pain, inflammation and urticaria.

============================================================
CHUNK 11
============================================================
EPIDEMIOLOGY
The northern Australian box jellyfish or sea wasp ( Chironex fleckeri ) is the most dangerous species, having killed more than 70 people since 1883. The peak season for stings is December through January. Fatal stings in the Indo-Pacific region are attributable to Chiropsalmus quadrumanus and Chiropsalmus  quadrigatus and,  elsewhere,  Portuguese men-o'-war  ( Physalia spp.)  and  Chinese Stomolophus  nomurai have caused a number of fatalities. Irukandji syndrome occurs in northern

Queensland and the Florida-Caribbean area, and is caused by stings of  tiny  cubomedusoids  like Carukia  barnesi .  Epidemics  of  'mauve stinger' Pelagia  noctiluca stings  occur  in  the  northern  Adriatic  coast where stinging sea anemones ( Anemonia sulcata ) also occur.

============================================================
CHUNK 12
============================================================
PREVENTION
Avoid the sea when warning notices are displayed or bathe only in 'stinger-resistant' enclosures. 'Lycra' or wetsuits and nylon stockings protect against nematocyst stings.

============================================================
CHUNK 13
============================================================
CLINICAL FEATURES
Stings may produce diagnostic patterns: C. fleckeri -striated brownishpurple weals (Fig. 134.1.4); Carukia barnesi -a transient erythematous macule;  Portuguese  man-o'-war ( Physalia spp.)-chains  of oval weals surrounded by erythema. Immediate severe pain is the commonest symptom. Chirodropids ( Chironex and Chiropsalmus spp.) can cause respiratory arrest, generalized convulsions, pulmonary edema, and  cardiac  arrest  within  minutes  of  the  sting.  Symptoms  include cough,  nausea,  vomiting,  abdominal  colic,  diarrhea,  rigors,  severe musculoskeletal  pains  and  profuse  sweating.  Irukandji  syndrome comprises severe musculoskeletal pain, anxiety, trembling, headache, piloerection,  sweating,  tachycardia,  hypertension,  and  pulmonary edema starting  about  30 min  after  a  sting  by C.  barnesi and  other cubomedusoids) and persisting for hours. Envenoming by Physalia species may result in intravascular hemolysis, peripheral gangrene and renal failure.

============================================================
CHUNK 14
============================================================
TREATMENT
To prevent drowning, remove victims from the water as soon as possible. A slurry of baking soda and water [50% (w/v)] is recommended by American authorities for stings by the widely distributed Atlantic genus, Chrysaora . For stings by C. fleckeri and other cubozoans, including  Irukandji,  but  not  for Chrysaora , Physalia or Stomalophus spp., apply vinegar or 3-10% aqueous acetic acid solution, which inhibits nematocyst discharge. Pressure immobilization and verapamil are not recommended. Shave off adherent tentacles with a razor. Hot water treatment  (see  venomous  fish  above)  relieves  the  pain  of Physalia stings [4]. Specific 'sea  wasp' antivenom for C. fleckeri is  manufactured in Australia, but its efficacy is questionable.

TREATMENT
Hot water (see above) may relieve the pain. Spines should be squeezed out or removed surgically, but this may prove impossible. There is a risk of marine bacterial infections (see above).

CHUNK 17
============================================================
MOLLUSCA (CONE SHELLS AND OCTOPUSES)
Cone  shells  (genus Conus )  (Fig.  134.1.6)  are  carnivorous  marine snails  that  harpoon  their  prey,  implanting  a  radular  tooth  charged with venom containing a mixture of many small (10-30 amino acid) peptide toxins. Careless handling of these attractive shells may result in  a  potentially  fatal  sting.  Symptoms  of  envenoming  are  nausea, vomiting, paraesthesia  and  numbness of  the  lips  and  site  of  sting, numbness, dizziness, ptosis, diplopia, dysarthria, dyspnea and loss of consciousness.
Small, blue-ringed octopuses of the Australian and West Pacific region ( Hapalochlaena spp.) (Fig. 134.1.7) can inject tetrodotoxin when they bite with their powerful beaks. These bites are painful and cause local bleeding, swelling and inflammation. Severe neurotoxic symptoms,

Key features
- Land and aquatic leeches are blood-sucking annelids, most common in tropical forests, rivers and lakes
- Bleeding continues after the leech has fed and detached because of salivary anticoagulants
- Prevention is by protective clothing and liberal use of diethyl toluamide (DEET) repellent
- Attached leeches should be gently removed. Chemicals may encourage regurgitation into, and infection of, the wound (e.g. with their symbiotic Aeromonas hydrophila )
These  blood-sucking,  hermaphroditic,  egg-laying  annelids  attach their  elongated  annulated  bodies  to  leaves,  rocks  or  the  host  by  a posterior sucker. By standing on the posterior sucker and waving the anterior sucker, they can sense their prey with amazing efficiency. They drop on to the prey or pursue it with a looping or lashing motion. The anterior  sucker contains  the  mouth,  armed  with three  radially arranged  jaws  which  make  a  Y-shaped  incision  and  secrete  saliva containing a histamine-like vasodilator and anticoagulants, such as hirudin [from the medicinal leech ( Hirudo medicinalis ), which inhibits thrombin  and  factor  IXa];  hementin  (from Haementeria  ghilianii , which  is  directly  fibrinolytic);  and  hementerin  [from Haementeria depressa ( Haementeria lutzi ), a plasminogen activator]. Other enzymes include esterases, antitrypsin, antiplasmin and anti-elastase [1].
Land leeches, 1-8 cm long, infest rainforest vegetation and usually attach  themselves  to  the  lower  legs  or  ankles  after  a  bite  that  may be painless. They ingest about a milliliter of blood in one hour and and even fatal generalized paralysis, may develop within 15 minutes of the bite.

Aquatic  leeches  are  swallowed  when  stagnant  water  is  drunk  and they invade the mouth, nostrils, eyes, vulva, vagina, urethra or anus of swimmers.
Blood sucking leeches have a global distribution but have the greatest impact in damp forests of the subtropical and tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific  region.  Pond,  lake  and  stream  water  is  often  used  for bathing, washing clothes, washing utensils and animals, and human consumption in  villages.  Leeches  are  commonly present  in  ponds, particularly in the rainy season.

============================================================
CHUNK 22
============================================================
PREVENTION
Apply repellents such as dibutyl phthalate and diethyl toluamide to clothing,  skin  and  the  inside  and  outside  of  footwear.  Children should be discouraged from bathing in leech-infested waters and all drinking water should be boiled or filtered.

============================================================
CHUNK 23
============================================================
CLINICAL FEATURES [2]
The  main  effect  is  blood  loss,  but  other  symptoms  include  local soreness, secondary infection, residual itching and phobia. Ingested aquatic leeches may  penetrate the bronchi or esophagus but usually attach to the pharynx or nasal passages, causing a feeling of movement at the back of the throat with cough, hoarseness, stridor, breathlessness,  epistaxis,  hemoptysis,  hematemesis  and  fatal  upper airway obstruction. Leeches are no longer thought to be a cause of 'halzoun' (Lebanon) or 'marrara' (Sudan) (Chapter 135). Leeches penetrating  the  anus  may  reach  the  rectosigmoid  junction  causing perforation and peritonitis. Bleeding may persist for up to a week after the leech has dropped off. Transmission of pathogens has been suggested, but not proved-except in the case of wound infection by A. hydrophila , which lives symbiotically in the leeches gut.

============================================================
CHUNK 24
============================================================
TREATMENT [3]
Leeches will detach if salt, alcohol, turpentine or vinegar is applied, but these chemicals may make the leech regurgitate into the wound. Gentle  mechanical  removal  is  preferred,  but  avoid  pulling  off  the leech so roughly that its mouth parts are left in the wound to cause chronic infection. A styptic, such as silver nitrate, or a firm dressing stops  the  bleeding.  Invasive  aquatic  leeches  must  be  removed  by endoscope,  aided  by  30%  cocaine,  10%  tartaric  acid  or  dilute (1  :  1 0  000)  adrenaline  (epinephrine)  in  the  nasopharynx,  larynx, trachea or esophagus, and concentrated salt solution in the genitourinary tract and rectum.

MANAGEMENT
Vascular  injury  is  a  major  determinant  of  mortality.  Immediate medical  care  involves  resuscitation  (control  of  hemorrhage,  fluid replacement and treatment of hypothermia), washout, debridement and  follow-up  for  prevention  of  infection  and  closure  of  more complex wounds [3-5]. A study  of  shark  wounds  in  Recife,  Brazil discovered  more  than  80  bacterial  pathogens,  mainly  Enterobacteriaceae,  all  of  which  were  covered  by  gentamicin,  vancomycin  and levofloxacin [6]. Isolates include Vibrio spp. such as Vibrio carchariae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Photobacterium (Vibrio) damsela and Aeromonas spp.

============================================================
CHUNK 27
============================================================
PREVENTION
Take local advice. Most attacks occur between 06.00 h and 20.00 h, but sharks come closer to the shore and are most active in twilight or darkness. Avoid bathing between sand bars and the ocean, far out to sea, where dead fish or sewage are being discharged and flocks of birds are feeding. Do not bathe if you are injured, bleeding, wearing jewelry or brightly patterned or colored clothes, or with a pet dog. Surfers and surface swimmers are targeted more often than divers. Reduce risk by bathing in groups, close to the shore and only in daylight. If attacked by a shark, fight back-hit it on the nose and claw at its eyes and gills. Chemical and electrical-field repellents and chainmail protective suits have been developed.

BARRACUDAS
The great barracuda ( Sphyraena barracuda ) of the tropical Atlantic can grow to almost two meters in length. Its powerful jaws and numerous long,  razor-sharp,  fang-like  teeth  can  sever  a  digit  or  even  a  hand. Hands  and  ankles  may  be  bitten  when  a  landed  fish  is  thrashing about still on the line or while the hook is being disengaged. Barracudas are attracted by shining objects, such as rings and bracelets on hands dangled in the water and may leap out of the water in pursuit of a fish that is being pulled in on an angler's line.

SHARKS
Sharks  are  most  common  in  oceans  between  latitudes  47°  south and 46° north, especially where water  temperature is  above 20°C. There are about 70-100 shark attacks with 5-15 fatalities each year (case fatality ~8%), mostly in North American (especially Florida), Australian  and  South  African  waters  [1].  Great  white  ( Carcharodon carcharias )  (length ~16 m, weight 2250 kg), tiger ( Galeocerdo cuvier ) (5.5 m,  900 kg)  (Fig.  134.3.1A-E)  and  bull  ( Carcharhinus  leucas ) (3.5 m, 360 kg) sharks are the most dangerous, but attacks have been reported  by  32  species;  all  70  species  exceeding  2 m  in  length  are potentially lethal. Devastating deep wounds, especially of buttocks, thighs or shoulders result in massive bleeding from severed arteries causing shock and the risk of drowning. Shark wounds are characterized by sharp incisions without abrasions, serrated edges, a triangular or  rectangular  flap  of  skin,  regular  spacing  corresponding  to  the shark's teeth, gouge marks on the bones and severing of body parts at  the  joints  without  fractures  (Fig.  134.3.2A-C)  [2].  Bumping  or rubbing against shark skin can inflict severe abrasions caused by their placoid scales.
D
eels may be encountered by divers exploring coral reefs and wrecks. Attacks  are  unusual  but  the  eels'  multiple  rows  of  long,  fang-like, backward-pointing teeth may cause deep puncture wounds with avulsion  of  tissue  if  the  animal  is  forcefully  removed  (Fig.  134.3.3). Despite much speculation, they have no venom apparatus but a major threat is infection of the bite wounds with a variety of marine Vibrio, Aeromonas and Pseudomonas spp. [7].

MANAGEMENT OF INJURIES BY OTHER DANGEROUS FISH
The  same  principles  apply  as  with  shark  bites,  although  trauma  is usually on a much smaller scale. Infection with aquatic microorganisms is a serous problem, especially in immunocompromised people; in  salt  water: Fusarium  solani,  Vibrio  vulnificus,  V .  parahaemolyticus, Vibrio  alginolyticus,  Erysipelothrix  rhusiopathiae (causing  erysipeloid, 'seal finger' and 'whale finger'), Plesiomonas shigelloides, Acinetobacter spp. ,  Chromobacterium  violaceum,  Flavobacterium spp. ,  Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Mycobacterium marinum, Prototheca spp. and Staphylococcus aureus (off  populous  beeches  such  as  Waikiki,  Honolulu);  and  in freshwater, Aeromonas hydrophila and free-living amoebae.
In cases of severe, extensive injuries, especially if there has been delay in presentation,  blind antibiotic treatment is appropriate with oral doxycycline  or  co-trimoxazole  or  parenteral  tetracycline  and  an aminoglycoside  combined  with  either  cefotaxime  or  a  fluoroquinolone. Results of cultures will direct specific therapy.

Key features
- Bites by venomous helodermid lizards (Gila monsters and Mexican beaded lizards of Middle America) are rare: envenoming causes severe pain, swelling, hypotension, nausea, vomiting, sweating and sometimes angioedema and evidence of myocardial eAects
- First aid involves urgent disengagement of the animal's jaws. As no antivenom is available, treatment is supportive and symptomatic
- Varanid, iguanid and agamid lizards may be capable of envenoming-notably the Komodo dragon

INTRODUCTION: VENOMOUS LIZARDS
Venomous  salivary  secretion  have  been  demonstrated  in  Iguanas (Iguanidae), glass/alligator lizards (Anguidae) and monitors (Varanidae)-notably  the  Komodo  dragon  ( Varanus  komodoensis ) which has been responsible for human fatalities that were attributed to trauma or infection of the bite wounds [1]. However, the only two lizards  of  proven  medical  importance  are  members  of  the  family Helodermatidae that inhabit dry forests and deserts in western Middle America [2-4]. The Mexican beaded lizard or escorpió n ( Heloderma horridum ) (Fig. 134.4.1A, B) is the larger (up to 1 m in total length and 2 kg in weight) with a relatively longer tail and a more arboreal habit. It is found in western Mexico, south to Guatemala. The Gila monster ( Heloderma  suspectum )  (Fig.  134.4.1B-D),  which reaches  a total  length  of  55 cm  and  a  weight  of  1 kg,  occurs  in  the  southwestern USA (south-east Nevada, south-west Utah, south-east California, south-west New Mexico, Arizona) and adjacent areas of Mexico

VENOM APPARATUS
Venom  from  bulging  multi-lobed  anterior  submandibular  glands pools in labial gutters in the lower jaw. When threatened, the lizards open and shut their mouths to promote drooling of venom-enriched saliva. When they bite and chew, venom is inoculated by the mandibular (dentary) teeth of which the fourth to the seventh are most prominently grooved, and the maxillary teeth, which are less grooved.

============================================================
CHUNK 44
============================================================
VENOM COMPOSITION [4, 5]
Heloderma  venoms  contain  toxic  proteases,  hyaluronidase,  phospholipase  A2,  horridum  toxin  (a  glycoprotein  tissue  kallikrein-like enzyme  that  releases  bradykinin  and  is  probably  responsible  for hypotension in human victims of envenoming), bioactive peptides of great scientific interest, including helospectin (a vasoactive intestinal peptide analogue) and exendins -3 and -4, which are glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) homologues that stimulate insulin secretion and inhibit  glucagon  secretion.  A  synthetic  homologue  of  exendin-4, exenatide, is a high affinity GLP-1 receptor agonist which has been developed for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

============================================================
CHUNK 45
============================================================
HELODERMA BITES
These are virtually never accidental because helodermids are reclusive and non-aggressive animals that inhabit thinly-populated rural areas. Almost exclusively, bites are inflicted on the fingers, hands and forearms of young men who are handling or trying to catch the lizards. Alcohol consumption seems to have contributed on many occasions, as is the case with bites by pet exotic snakes. Bites may be 'slashing' in type, in which the anterior maxillary teeth strike and can envenom but do not engage, and 'gripping', when the animal clings on and chews for up to 15 minutes before it can be removed [6]. Not all bites result in envenoming.

============================================================
CHUNK 46
============================================================
SYMPTOMS OF ENVENOMING [6-9]
Envenoming by H. suspectum and H. horridum causes identical clinical syndromes. Pain may start immediately and is described as throbbing or burning. It may radiate up the bitten limb to the shoulder, chest and epigastrium, and is often excruciating in intensity, persisting for 24 hours or more. Swelling also develops rapidly, extending, in some cases, to involve the whole limb, but although it may be tense, compartment  syndrome  has  never  been  described.  The  bite  site  is  erythematous  or  cyanosed  with  traumatic  ecchymoses  and  persistent bleeding, but tissue necrosis does not develop. Red lymphangitic lines extend up the limb and regional lymph glands may become tender and enlarged. Local paresthesia, hyperesthesia and even paralysis have been  described.  The  earliest  systemic  symptoms  start  within  five minutes of the bite: dizziness, weakness, nausea, vomiting, profuse generalized sweating, breathlessness and weakness. Hypotension and tachycardia are commonly recorded. These symptoms may be transient or recurrent. Less commonly, there is angioedema (swelling of lips,  tongue,  throat  and  upper  airway)  [10],  increased  secretions, chills, fever and tinnitus.

============================================================
CHUNK 47
============================================================
INVESTIGATIONS
Neutrophil leukocytosis is common. In exceptional cases, thrombocytopenia and mild coagulopathy have been described. Electrocardiographic  changes  include  T-wave  abnormalities,  conduction  defects and, in one case, myocardial infarction and acute kidney injury were documented  in  a  previously  fit  23-year-old  man  [1 1,  12].  Clearly, envenoming may be life-threatening but the few alleged fatalities, all reported before 1930, are difficult to attribute.

============================================================
CHUNK 48
============================================================
TREATMENT: FIRST-AID
The longer the lizard is allowed to retain its grip and to chew,  the more venomous saliva will be inoculated into the wound. The priority is to disengage, but the powerful jaws make this difficult. Rejected dangerous  and  barbaric  methods  include  application  of  a  flame under  the  animal's  jaw,  instilling  gasoline  or  chloroform  into  its mouth or severing its jaw muscles with a knife. Pulling the animal off  by  its  tail  is  quick  but  risks  extending  the  bite  wounds  and detaching  teeth.  Expert  opinion  currently  favors  levering  the  jaws apart with a screw driver, putting the attached lizard under the tap, placing its four feet on the ground or introducing some alcohol into its mouth.

============================================================
CHUNK 49
============================================================
TREATMENT: MEDICAL
Severe  pain  is  relieved  by  local  anesthetic  or  systemic  analgesia. Opiates may be required. The wound should be explored for shed teeth which are not detectable by radiography. The risk of infection has not been studied, but prophylactic antibiotics are not justified. However, tetanus toxoid is recommended and the wound should be observed for evidence of sepsis. Specific antivenoms have been raised experimentally in rabbits but they are not generally available. Hypotension can be treated with intravenous fluids and, if necessary, with epinephrine  or  dopamine.  Angioedema  responds  to  epinephrine, antihistamine and hydrocortisone. Otherwise,  treatment is symptomatic  and  supportive  and  the  patient  may  be  expected  to  recover completely in less than 1 week.

Key features
- Venomous snake bites are largely an occupational/ environmental hazard of agricultural workers and their children in rural areas of the tropics. Most bites could be prevented by wearing protective footwear, by using lights while walking at night and by sleeping oA the ground or under a well-tucked-in mosquito net
- Snake venoms are rich in toxic proteins that cause necrosis, shock, hemostatic disturbances, paralysis, rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury
- Bites by Elapidae (cobras, kraits, mambas, coral snakes, Australasian snakes, and sea snakes) may cause descending @accid paralysis. Some elapid venoms cause local necrosis, rhabdomyolysis and hemostatic disturbances
- Bites by Viperidae (vipers, adders and pit vipers: rattlesnakes, moccasins, lanceheads) can cause severe local swelling, bruising, blistering and necrosis together with shock, consumptive coagulopathy, spontaneous systemic bleeding, acute kidney injury and, with some species, neurotoxicity
- First aid involves reassurance, immobilization of the whole patient, especially the bitten limb, rapid evacuation to the nearest hospital and avoidance of dangerous traditional methods
- Speci?c antivenom is given if there is evidence of systemic or severe local envenoming. Assisted ventilation, renal dialysis or cardiovascular support may be required

INTRODUCTION
The  three  families  of  venomous  snakes-Atractaspididae,  Elapidae and Viperidae-contain some 500 species, whereas the fourth-the Colubridae,  once  considered  nonvenomous-contains  at  least  40 species venomous to humans. Less than 200 species have caused clinically severe envenoming ending in death or permanent disability.

============================================================
DISTRIBUTION OF VENOMOUS SNAKES [1]
Venomous species are widely  distributed, except  at  altitudes  above 5000  meters,  in  polar  regions  and  in  most  islands  of  the  western Mediterranean, Atlantic, Caribbean and Pacific. There are no venomous snakes in Madagascar, New Zealand, Ireland, Iceland and Chile. The range of Vipera  berus extends  into  the  Arctic  Circle.  Sea  snakes exist  in  the  Indian  and Pacific oceans and in estuaries, rivers (New Guinea) and lakes (Philippines, Cambodia, Solomon Islands).

CHUNK 54
============================================================
SNAKE CLASSIFICATION
Medically-important  snakes  always  possess  one  or  more  pairs  of enlarged teeth in the upper jaw-the fangs-which penetrate the skin of their victim and conduct venom into the tissues along a groove or through a lumen.

============================================================
CHUNK 55
============================================================
COLUBRIDAE
The fangs of colubrids are relatively short, are situated at the posterior end  of  the  maxilla  and  are  capable  of  only  restricted  movement (Fig. 134.5.1). African species, the boomslang (Dispholidus typus) and the  vine,  twig  or  bird  snakes  ( Thelotornis spp.)  have  killed  a  few people. The Japanese  yamakagashi (Rhabdophis  tigrinus) has  caused coagulopathy and at least two deaths, whereas the related Southeast Asian red-necked keelback (Rhabdophis subminiatus) has been responsible for cases of severe envenoming.

============================================================
CHUNK 56
============================================================
ATRACTASPIDINAE
The African and Middle Eastern burrowing asps, also known as burrowing or mole vipers, or adders and stiletto snakes, have long front fangs and strike sideways.  Three  species are  known  to  have  caused fatal envenoming.

============================================================
CHUNK 57
============================================================
ELAPIDAE
This family includes African and Asian cobras, Asian kraits, African mambas, American  coral  snakes,  Australasian  terrestrial  venomous snakes  and  sea  snakes.  The  relatively  short  anterior  fangs  of  these snakes are permanently  erect and  capable of  little  movement (Fig. 134.5.2). In the ringhals and African and Asian spitting cobras, the venom channel opens forward before it reaches the tip of the fang, allowing venom to be ejected as a fine spray for a distance of several meters into the eyes of an aggressor.

============================================================
CHUNK 58
============================================================
VIPERIDAE
The fangs are situated anteriorly, are up to 2.5 cm in length, curved and are capable of a wide range of movement (Fig. 134.5.3). Pit vipers (subfamily Crotalinae) comprise  rattlesnakes, moccasins,  South American lance-headed vipers and Asian pit vipers.  They possess a heat-sensitive  pit  organ  behind  the  nostril  (Fig.  134.5.4).  The  Old World vipers, subfamily Viperinae include the European, African and Asian vipers and adders.

INCIDENCE AND IMPORTANCE OF SNAKEBITE [2]
Snake bite is an important medical emergency in some parts of the rural tropics but its incidence is usually underestimated because most victims seek the help of traditional healers rather than practitioners of Western-style medicine. In coastal Kenya, where snake bites cause 6.7 deaths per 100,000 per year (0.7% of all deaths), 68% of bitten people had sought treatment from traditional healers. In the Benue Valley of north-east Nigeria, Echis ocellatus causes some 500 bites per 100,000 population per year, with a 12% mortality. Recently, a study of snake bite mortality in India, based on verbal autopsy, estimated 46,000 deaths each year. In Burma, Russell's viper bite is a common cause of acute kidney injury and is responsible for most of the estimated 1000 snake-bite deaths each year. In the USA, there are about 45,000 bites and a few deaths each year. Rattlesnakes, especially ( Crotalus  adamanteus,  Crotalus  atrox,  Crotalus  horridus,  Crotalus  oreganus, Crotalus scutulatus, Crotalus viridis and Sistrurus miliaris ), are the most

dangerous species. In Britain, the adder or viper ( Vipera berus ) is the only venomous species, biting more than 200 people each year. Only 14  deaths  have  been  reported  since  1876-the  last  in  1975.  This species  is  important  in  Scandinavian  countries. Vipera  aspis causes most bites in France, while Vipera ammodytes is important in eastern Europe.
Some hunter-gatherer tribes, such as the Yanomamo of Venezuela, the Waorani of Ecuador, the Kaxinawa of Brazil, the Hadza of Tanzania and some tribal groups in Papua New Guinea, suffer high mortality from snake bites. Global estimates of annual snake bite mortality vary from  20,000  to  125,000.  Many  survivors  are  left  with  permanent physical disability.

============================================================

============================================================
EPIDEMIOLOGY [3]
Most snake bites are inflicted on the lower limbs of farmers, plantation workers, herdsmen and hunters in rural areas of tropical developing  countries.  The  incidence  of  bites  by  a  particular  species  in  a particular  geographic area depends on the densities of human and snake populations, the snake's irritability (its inclination to bite when trodden on or disturbed) and diurnal rhythm, and the extent to which human activities encroach on its chosen habitat. The snake is usually trodden on at night or in  undergrowth. Some species, such  as the Asian kraits ( Bungarus spp.) and African spitting cobras ( Naja nigricollis,  Naja mossambica , etc.), enter human dwellings at night and may bite  people  who  roll  over  onto  them  while  sleeping  on  the  floor. Snakes do not bite without provocation, but may strike if inadvertently trodden upon or touched. In Europe, North America, and Australia, exotic snakes are increasingly popular pets. In these countries, bites are inflicted on the hands of (usually) males who are picking up their pets, often late at night while drunk. In the USA, 25% of bites result from snakes being attacked or handled. Serious bites by backfanged  (colubrid)  snakes  usually  occur  only  under  these  circumstances. Seasonal peaks in the incidence of snake bite are associated with agricultural activities, such as ploughing before the annual rains in the West African Sahel and the rice harvest in Southeast Asia, or to fluctuations in the activity or population of venomous snakes. Severe flooding,  by  concentrating  the  human and  snake  populations,  has

Invasion  of  virgin jungle during construction of new highways and irrigation and hydroelectric  schemes  has  led to an  increased incidence of snake  bite  in Brazil  and  Sri  Lanka.

PREVENTION OF SNAKE BITE
To reduce the risk of bites, snakes should never be disturbed, attacked, cornered  or  handled-even  if  they  are  thought  to  be  a  harmless species or appear to be dead. Venomous species should not be kept as pets or as performing animals. In snake-infested areas, boots, socks and long trousers should be worn for walks in undergrowth or deep sand, and a light should always be carried at night. Collecting firewood, dislodging logs and boulders with bare hands, pushing sticks or fingers into burrows, holes and crevices, climbing rocks and trees covered with dense foliage, and swimming in overgrown lakes and rivers are particularly hazardous activities. Unlit paths and gutters are especially dangerous after heavy rains. Sleeping on the ground carries a risk of nocturnal krait bites in South Asia and of spitting cobra bites in Africa, but mosquito nets are protective. It is futile and ecologically

============================================================
VENOM APPARATUS
The venom glands are surrounded by compressor muscles and are situated  behind or below the eye. The venom duct opens within a sheath at the base of the fang and venom is conducted toward the tip in a partially or completely closed groove or fang canal. Venomous snakes can inject doses of venom lethal to their natural prey at each of 10 or more consecutive strikes. Whether the dose can be adjusted according to the size of the prey or the intention of the snake is controversial.  The high  proportion  of  bites  without  envenoming  ('dry bites') reported for species such as Calloselasma rhodostoma ( > 50%) or Pseudonaja spp. ( > 80%) is more likely to reflect mechanical inefficiency than to voluntary control by the snake, and the concept of a defensive bite may not be valid. There is no support for the popular belief that snakes are less dangerous after they have eaten. The snake uses only a small fraction of the content of its venom gland at each strike.

============================================================
CHUNK 70
============================================================
VENOM COMPOSITION
More than 90% of the dry weight of venom is protein and each venom may contain more than 100 different proteins: enzymes (80-90% of viperid;  25-70%  of  elapid  venoms),  non-enzymatic  polypeptide toxins  and  non-toxic  proteins  such  as  nerve  growth  factor.  These include digestive hydrolases, hyaluronidase and activators or inactivators of many physiologic processes. Viperid venoms have metalloproteinases,  endopeptidase,  arginine  ester  hydrolase,  kininogenase,  as well as thrombin-like factor X, and prothrombin-activating enzymes responsible for the anti-hemostatic effects of envenoming. Phospholipases A2 (lecithinase) are found in many venoms. They damage mitochondria,  red  blood  cells,  leukocytes,  platelets,  peripheral  nerve endings,  skeletal  muscle,  vascular  endothelium  and  other  membranes, and produce presynaptic neurotoxic activity, opiate-like sedative effects and the autopharmacologic release of histamine. Some are anti-coagulant. Hyaluronidase promotes the spread of venom through tissues.

============================================================
CHUNK 71
============================================================
Necrotoxins
A variety of venom myotoxic and cytolytic factors may contribute to local tissue necrosis at the site of the bite. Studies of terciopelo ( Bothrops asper ) venom induced necrosis implicate zinc-dependent metalloproteinases and myotoxic phospholipases A2. In other cases, other digestive  hydrolases,  hyaluronidase,  polypeptide  cytotoxins  (Elapidae) and, perhaps, secondary effects of inflammation are involved.

============================================================
CHUNK 72
============================================================
Neurotoxins
Postsynaptic  ( α -)neurotoxins,  such  as α -bungarotoxin  and  cobrotoxin,  are  three-finger  fold  polypeptides  that  bind  to  acetylcholine receptors on the motor end-plate, like curare, competitively inhibiting acetylcholine.  Presynaptic  ( β -)neurotoxins, such  as β -bungarotoxin, crotoxin,  taipoxin  and  notexin,  are  phospholipases  A 2 that  prevent release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction and damage the nerve endings irreparably. Myotoxic phospholipases A2 in venoms of  Elapidae,  notably  sea  snakes  and  some  Australasian,  American and  Asian  terrestrial  elapids  an  Viperidae  can  cause  generalized rhabdomyolysis.

============================================================
CHUNK 73
============================================================
Cardiovascular and autopharmacologic toxins
Some venoms release vasodilating autacoids such as histamine and kinins. Venom of the Brazilian jararaca ( Bothrops jararaca ) and other vipers  contain  bradykinin  potentiating  and  angiotensin  converting enzyme (ACE) inhibiting peptides that cause hypotension. Sarafotoxins from the venom of the Israeli burrowing asp ( Atractaspis  engaddensis )  are  similar  to  physiologic  endothelins.  They  are  potent vasoconstrictors  of  the  coronary  arteries  and  delay  atrioventricular conduction.

Variation in Venom Composition
Venom composition varies enormously from species to species but also within a single species throughout its geographic range, at different seasons of the year and as the snake matures.

============================================================
CHUNK 75
============================================================
Pharmacology
When snakes bite humans, venom is usually introduced subcutaneously or  intramuscularly. Intravenous injection  is  a  rare  possibility. Smaller Mw elapid neurotoxins are rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream, whereas larger Mw phospholipase A2 presynaptic toxins and viperid enzymes are taken up more slowly through the lymphatics, sometimes causing visible lymphangitis and enlarged, painful lymph nodes. Continuing absorption of venom from the depot at the site of bite  may  explain  delayed  or  recurrent  envenoming  after  an  initial therapeutic response to antivenom. Redistribution of venom toxins into the vascular compartment may occur as a result of antivenom treatment. Envenoming after ingestion of snake venom has not been reported in humans. Most venoms are concentrated and bound in the kidney and some components are eliminated in the urine. Crotaline venoms are selectively bound in the lungs, concentrated in the liver and excreted in bile, while polypeptide neurotoxins, such as α -bungarotoxin, are tightly bound at neuromuscular junctions. Most venom  components  do  not  cross  the  intact  blood  brain  barrier. Central nervous system effects of venoms remain controversial.

CHUNK 76
============================================================
CLINICAL EFFECTS [4]
The patient who has been bitten by a snake may present with symptoms resulting from fear, from prehospital treatment and from effects of the venom itself. Snake bite is usually a terrifying experience, especially for those who believe that all bites are rapidly fatal. Physiologic manifestations of anxiety, and even frank hysteria, may confuse the clinical  picture. Thus, patients who are bitten, but not envenomed, may feel flushed and breathless, with constriction of the chest, and a thumping pulse,  palpitations,  sweating and  effects of  hyperventilation,  such  as  faintness,  acroparesthesia  and  even  tetany,  may  be noticed.  Such  symptoms  dominate  many  accounts  of  snake  bites written  by  the  victims  and  are  falsely  attributed  to  neurotoxicity. Misguided traditional  prehospital  treatments  can  result  in  swelling and ischemia of limbs whose circulation is occluded by tourniquets, bleeding or sensory loss resulting from local incisions, vomiting and other side effects caused by ingested herbal remedies, smarting eyes and  conjunctivitis  from  instillation  of  plant  juices,  and  bronchospasm  from  insufflation  of  oils.  Rarely,  snake  bite  may  precipitate vaso-vagal collapse, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmia.

============================================================
General symptoms and signs
The evolution of symptoms and signs of envenoming depends on the nature of the venom, the dose and the site of injection. The earliest symptom is usually pain-felt immediately. Local swelling may start within  minutes  and  consumption  coagulopathy  with  undetectable plasma concentrations  of fibrinogen  and  other  clotting  factors  can develop  in  half  an  hour  ( C.  rhodostoma and Echis species).  Rarely, death may occur as soon as 15 minutes after an elapid (e.g. Naja naja or Dendroaspis species) or viper (e.g. Daboia russelii, Daboia siamensis ) bite. Usually, however, death comes hours after an elapid or sea snake bite and days after a viper bite.

Local eFects
This is characteristic of bites by the Viperidae, including the pit vipers of the subfamily Crotalinae, African spitting cobras (e.g. N. mossambica, N. nigricollis ) and Asian cobras (e.g., N. naja , Naja kaouthia and Naja siamensis ). Tender swelling spreads from the site of the bite and there is early tender enlargement of lymph nodes draining the bitten area.  Within  a  few  hours,  blood  or  fluid-filled  bullae  may  appear under  the  epidermis  (Fig.  134.5.5).  With  elapid  bites,  blistering  is nearly always followed by tissue necrosis, usually superficial, which may  extend  up  the  fascial  planes  of  the  limb,  sometimes  as  skip

lesions  separated  by  areas  of  unaffected  skin  (Fig.  134.5.6).  Bullae caused by Viperidae bites frequently dry up and slough without the development of necrosis. A pale, anesthetic, demarcated area of skin with a characteristic odor of putrefaction signals the appearance of necrosis.  This  is  an  effect  of  the  venom,  but  the  necrotic  tissue  is vulnerable to secondary infection by bacteria, including anaerobes.

============================================================
Local eFects
Massive swelling of the bitten limb indicates increased permeability leading  to  extravasation  of  circulating  volume;  a  swollen  limb  can accommodate several liters of blood. The result may be hypovolemia and  hypotension.  Envenoming  by  rattlesnakes  ( Crotalus )  produces local pain with swelling that appears within 15 minutes of the bite and may spread rapidly. Bruising along the path of lymphatics and bullae,  and  local  necrosis  may  develop.  Paresthesias  of  the  tongue and lips and an abnormal metallic taste are common early symptoms following bites by Pacific ( C. oreganus ),  eastern  diamondback ( C . adamanteus ), western diamondback ( C . atrox ) and timber ( C. horridus ) rattlesnakes. Other symptoms include weakness, rigors, sweating, fasciculation, spontaneous  bleeding, neurotoxic effects ( C. adamanteus , C. scutulatus ) and gastrointestinal symptoms. Bites by the Mohave rattlesnake ( C. scutulatus ) and Crotalus durissus terrificus may produce little, or no, local swelling but severe systemic signs.

Bleeding and clotting disturbances [5]
This combination is characteristic of vipers, pit vipers and some Australasian elapids. Spontaneous bleeding is most frequently detected in the gingival sulci (Fig. 134.5.7). The most common sites of hemorrhage are intracerebral, gastrointestinal and retroperitoneal. Incoagulable blood is suggested by oozing from venipuncture sites or sites of recent trauma.

Neurotoxicity
This is a feature  of envenoming by elapids. A  few species of vipers also produce neurotoxic effects, for example C. durissus terrificus , Gloydius brevicaudus , Bitis atropos and D. russelii (especially in Sri Lanka). Typically, neurotoxic symptoms develop early, but after krait bite there may be a delay of 10 or more hours. Symptoms include vomiting, headache, paresthesia, drowsiness, apathy or euphoria, hyperacusis, diplopia,  blurred  vision,  heaviness  of  the  eyelids  and  difficulty  in speaking. The levator palpebrae superioris and extraocular muscles are  the  most  sensitive  to  neuromuscular  blockade  and,  in  some patients, the only feature of envenoming is ptosis and ophthalmoplegia. More serious effects are paralysis of the palate, jaws, tongue, vocal cords,  neck  muscles  and  muscles  of  deglutition  and  respiration (Fig.  134.5.9).  The  intercostal  muscles  are  affected  before  the  diaphragm and limbs. Paralyzed patients are fully conscious unless they are hypoxemic  (respiratory failure) or hypotensive (circulatory failure). Neurotoxicity is usually completely reversible; in some cases there is a rapid response to specific antivenom or anticholinesterase, and in others there is slow, spontaneous resolution. With no specific

Generalized rhabdomyolysis
Envenoming by sea snakes [6], some Australasian elapids, D. russelii in Sri Lanka and C. durissus terrificus can cause systemic rhabdomyolysis.

Acute kidney injury
Renal failure can complicate almost any severe case of snakebite, but it is the major cause of death in victims of sea snakes, some Australasian elapids, Russell's vipers and C . durissus terrificus . Mechanisms of renal  damage  include ischemia  (from  hypotension,  renal  vasoconstriction or disseminated intravascular coagulation) (Fig. 134.5.10), hemorrhage, direct nephrotoxicity or pigment nephropathy associated with  massive  intravascular  hemolysis,  microangiopathic  hemolysis, generalized rhabdomyolysis and associated electrolyte disturbances.

Venom ophthalmia caused by spitting cobras [7]
The ringhals (Hemachatus haemachatus) and African and Asian spitting cobras can eject venom in a fine stream from the tips of their fangs for a distance of a few meters. If venom enters the eye, there is intense local pain, leukorrhea, blepharospasm and palpebral edema. Because most patients make an uneventful recovery, these injuries used to be thought trivial, but slit lamp examination reveals corneal erosions in more than half of the cases. There is the same risk of secondary infection as  with  other  corneal injuries (Fig. 134.5.1 1), leading  to

LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS
The peripheral white blood cell count is raised in patients severely envenomed by many species of snakes. Anemia is the result of bleeding or, much more rarely, intravascular and microangiopathic hemolysis.  Thrombocytopenia  occurs  with  disseminated  intravascular coagulation,  together  with  a  hemolytic  uremic-like  syndrome  in victims of some viper and Australian elapid envenomings. Important simple  tests  for  venom-induced  defibrination  are  the  20-minute whole blood clotting test A few milliliters of blood are placed in a new, clean, dry glass test tube, left undisturbed for 20 minutes and then tipped once to check for clotting (Fig. 134.5.12). Serum potassium  is  elevated  by  the  generalized  rhabdomyolysis  of  sea  snake envenoming.  Serum  enzymes,  such  as  aspartate  and  alanine  aminotransferases  and  creatine  kinase,  are  mildly  elevated  in  patients with local tissue damage but are grossly raised if there is generalized rhabdomyolysis.  Electrocardiographic  changes,  such  as  inverted  T waves, raised ST segments, prolonged Q-Tc intervals and arrhythmias, have  been  reported.  The  urine  of  snakebite  victims  commonly

VENOM IMMUNODIAGNOSIS
Specific snake venom antigens have been detected in wound swabs, aspirates or biopsies, serum, urine, cerebrospinal fluid and other body fluids. Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) has been the most widely used. Under ideal conditions, relatively high venom antigen concentrations (wound swabs or aspirates) may be  detected quickly enough (1530 min)  to  allow  the  selection  of  the  appropriate  monospecific antivenom. A commercial venom detection kit for Australian elapids is produced by CSL (Melbourne, Australia). For retrospective diagnosis, including forensic cases, tissue around the fang punctures, wound and  blister  aspirate,  serum  and  urine  should  be  stored  for  EIA immunodiagnosis.

TREATMENT OF SNAKE BITE [3, 4, 8-10]
Snakebite is a rare emergency in most parts of the world and because its management is thought to require specialized knowledge, many clinicians close their minds to the simple therapeutic principles that could prevent morbidity and mortality. Management starts with first aid by relatives, friends or fellow workers of the snakebite victim who happen to be present where and when the bite occurs. Therefore, first aid  principles  should  be  a  priority  subject  for  community  health education in schools, at clinics and via the media.

============================================================
CHUNK 89
============================================================
FIRST-AID TREATMENT
Most  snakebite  victims  are  terrified  and  require  reassurance.  The bitten limb should be immobilized, if possible, with a splint or sling and the patient quickly moved to the nearest treatment facility. Pain can  be  treated  with  oral  acetaminophen  or  codeine  phosphate. Aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents should be avoided, if possible, as they may lead to persistent gastric bleeding in patients with incoagulable blood. Local incisions and suction are more likely to introduce infection and cause persistent bleeding than to remove significant amounts of venom from the wound. In one study of viper bites in Jammu, India, 94% of patients who had received incisions developed local infection, compared with none in the group without incisions.  Vacuum  extractors,  potassium  permanganate  instillation and ice packs can increase local necrosis. Electric shock treatment is potentially dangerous and of unproven value.

============================================================
CHUNK 90
============================================================
Tourniquets
Tight (arterial-occlusive) tourniquets must never be recommended for snake bite first-aid because they have been responsible for gangrenous limbs, peripheral nerve damage and other harmful effects.

============================================================
CHUNK 91
============================================================
Pressure-Immobilization (P-I) and Pressure Pad
These are the only two acceptably safe and promising first-aid methods currently available, but both require further clinical testing. In animal studies,  compressing  superficial  veins  and  lymphatics  in  the  bitten limb at about 55 mmHg reduced the spread of larger Mw toxins such as  the  presynaptic  phospholipase  A2  toxins  of  Australian  elapid venoms. In practice, the entire bitten limb is bound firmly, using a 10-cm  wide elasticated  bandage, starting  at  the  toes  or  fingers  and finishing at the groin or axilla. A splint is incorporated to aid immobilization. Anecdotal experience supports the use of the method but it  has proved difficult to train people to apply it correctly. However, it is the only known method for delaying the onset of potentially fatal respiratory paralysis after a neurotoxic elapid bite before the patient reaches medical care without incurring the dangers of a tight arterial tourniquet. If the necessary skills and equipment are available immediately, pressure-immobilization (P-I) should be applied, unless it is possible to eliminate the possibility of a neurotoxic elapid bite (e.g. by confident identification of the snake or exclusion on geographical grounds). A local pressure pad applied over the bite wound has been advocated for Russell's viper bites in Burma.

============================================================
CHUNK 92
============================================================
Transport to medical care
Patients should be transported to hospital as quickly, but as passively, as possible. They should be placed on their left side in the recovery position to prevent aspiration of vomit. Persistent vomiting can be treated with chlorpromazine by intramuscular injection (25-50 mg in adults, 1 mg/kg in children) [intravenous (IV) injection risks hypotension] or  chlorpromazine or prochlorperazine by intrarectal suppository.  Syncope,  shock,  angio-oedema  and  other  anaphylactic symptoms  can  be  treated  with  0.1%  adrenaline  (epinephrine)  by intramuscular injection (0.5 ml for adults, 0.01 ml/kg for children) and an antihistamine such as chlorphenamine maleate, by IV injection (10 mg for adults, 0.2 mg/kg for children). Respiratory distress and  cyanosis  should  be  treated  by  clearing  the  airway,  preventing obstruction by the tongue by jaw-lifting, inserting an oropharyngeal airway and by positioning, giving oxygen and, if necessary, assisted ventilation. If the patient is unconscious and no femoral or carotid pulses can be detected, cardiopulmonary resuscitation must be started immediately.
If the snake has been killed it should be brought to the hospital for identification, but it must be handled cautiously as even snakes that appear dead and severed heads can cause envenoming. They should be carried on a stick or maneuvered into a container.

============================================================
CHUNK 93
============================================================
TREATMENT BY MEDICALLY-TRAINED PERSONNEL IN HOSPITAL OR DISPENSARY
Because of the uncertainties about the type, quantity and quality of venom injected and the variable time course for development of signs of envenoming, all victims of snakebite should be hospitalized and observed for at least 24 hours. Frequent observations of the level of consciousness,  blood  pressure,  and  pulse  and  respiratory  rate,  and new signs, such as ptosis, should be made. Any ligatures should be released,  preferably  after  starting  administration  of  antivenom  (see ' Antivenom Treatment ' below). Physical examination should include assessment of local swelling, tender enlargement of regional lymph nodes  draining  the  bitten  area,  spontaneous  bleeding  [most  often detected in the gingival sulci (Fig. 134.5.1), nose and gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts, blood pressure,  ptosis [the earliest sign of
neurotoxic envenoming (Fig. 134.5.3)] and assessment of respiratory muscle  power.  If  a  coagulopathic  venom  is  suspected,  hemostasis should  be  checked  at  the  bedside  by  the  20-minute  whole  blood clotting test or by rapid laboratory tests of hemostasis.

============================================================
CHUNK 94
============================================================
ANTIVENOM TREATMENT
Antivenom (also known as antivenin, antivenene and anti-snakebite serum) is the only specific antidote to envenoming. It is the partially purified immunoglobulin (whole IgG, F(ab')2, or Fab fragments) of horses or sheep that have been hyperimmunized with venoms of one species of snake (monovalent) or several species (polyvalent) of greatest medical importance in a particular region [1 1].

============================================================
CHUNK 95
============================================================
Indications
Because  of  their  high  cost  and  the  inherent  danger  of  reactions, antivenoms should not be used indiscriminately. Antivenom is indicated if there is systemic envenoming evidenced by hypotension or other signs of cardiovascular toxicity, signs of neurotoxicity or generalized  myotoxicity,  impaired  consciousness,  spontaneous  systemic bleeding  and  incoagulable  blood.  Supporting  evidence  of  severe envenoming is provided by a peripheral leukocytosis of more than 20 × 10 9 /l, elevated serum enzymes, hemoglobinuria, myoglobinuria, severe  anemia  or  hemoconcentration,  uremia  and  oliguria.  In  the absence of systemic envenoming, massive local swelling (involving more than half of the bitten limb), bites on fingers or toes and rapidly progressive swelling following bites by species known to cause necrosis are indications for antivenom.

============================================================
CHUNK 96
============================================================
Contraindications
There is no absolute contraindication to antivenom; however, because of  the  increased  danger  of  severe  reactions,  atopic  individuals  and those  known to be  hypersensitive  to equine  serum  should  be  pretreated  with  epinephrine,  hydrocortisone and  antihistamine  (doses above) and watched carefully for at least two hours after completion of antivenom administration.

============================================================
CHUNK 97
============================================================
Administration
Antivenom should be given as soon as indicated, but it may be effective as long as signs of systemic envenoming persist (seven days or more after the bite in the case of patients with viperid bite coagulopathy). To prevent local envenoming, antivenom must be given early, within a few hours of envenoming. Only specific antivenom-one whose  range  of  specificity  includes  the  biting  species-should  be used.  Some  antivenoms  raised  against  the  venom  of  one  or  two species have  paraspecific  activity  against venoms  of  related  species. Antivenom should be diluted in an appropriate volume of fluid and given by 'push' injection over 10-15 minutes or by IV infusion over 30-60  minutes.  Epinephrine  0.1%  solution,  0.5 ml  for  adults  or 0.01 ml/kg for children, must be ready to be given, by intramuscular injection, in case of early anaphylactic reactions during the infusion. The patient must be watched carefully while antivenom is being given and for at least two hours afterward. At the first sign of a reaction, administration  of  antivenom  should  be  stopped  and  epinephrine given. Once the symptoms of the reaction have subsided, antivenom infusion  can  be  completed.  IV  chlorphenamine  maleate  (10 mg in adults, 0.2 mg/kg  in  children)  and  hydrocortisone  (100 mg in adults, 2 mg/kg in children) are given to combat released mediators and to calm the patient. Antivenom reactions are not predicted by  conjunctival  or  intradermal  'hypersensitivity  tests'  which  can only  detect  specific  IgE.  Anti-H1  histamines  blockers  and  corticosteroids have proved ineffective, singly or in combination,  in preventing early  anaphylactic antivenom reactions, but  in  a recent, powerful study, epinephrine (adult dose 0.25 ml of 0.1% solution) administered  subcutaneously  before  antivenom  was  given  reduced the frequency of severe early anaphylactic reactions [12]. Appropriate initial doses of  antivenom have been established for some antivenoms (Table 134.5.2). Assessment of the antivenom dose will remain a matter of clinical judgment. The dose of antivenom for children and adults should be the same.

Spontaneous systemic bleeding usually stops within about 30 minutes of initiating antivenom therapy and blood clotting is usually restored within  6  hours if  an  adequate  neutralizing  dose  of  antivenom  has been  given.  Improvement  in  neurotoxic  symptoms  attributable  to postsynaptic toxins [e.g. Australian and Papuan death adder (genus Acanthophis ) and Asian cobras (genus Naja )] may be observed within 30-60  minutes.  However,  severe,  local  envenoming  nephrotoxicity following Russell's viper bites, and presynaptic neurotoxicity, are not reversed by antivenom. Further antivenom should be given if severe signs of envenoming persist after 1-2 hours or if blood coagulability is not restored within about six hours..

============================================================
ANTIVENOM REACTIONS
Early anaphylactic reactions usually develop within 10-60 minutes of starting  IV  administration  of  antivenom.  Premonitory  symptoms include restlessness, cough, itching of the scalp, nausea, vomiting, a feeling of heat or an increase in pulse rate followed by generalized pruritus  and  appearance  of  urticaria,  fever,  tachycardia,  autonomic manifestations  and,  in  a  few  patients,  severe  hypotension,  airflow obstruction and angioedema. The incidence of early reactions is dosedependent and also depends on the quality of manufacture. The cause of most reactions is complement activation by IgG aggregates, residual Fc fragments or osmotic effects rather than IgE-mediated type I hypersensitivity to equine serum, which is rare.
Pyrogenic reactions occur within 1-2 hours of antivenom treatment and can precipitate febrile convulsions in children. They are attributable to endotoxin-contamination during manufacture [11].
Late  reactions  of  serum  sickness  type  may  develop  5-10  days after antivenom treatment. They are dose-related. Clinical features include fever,  pruritus,  urticaria,  subcutaneous  and  periarticular  swellings, polyarthritis,  lymphadenopathy,  mononeuritis  multiplex  and  other neurologic symptoms, and proteinuria.

============================================================
Neurotoxic Envenoming
Patients unable to cough up or swallow their secretions aspirate and may develop fatal airway obstruction or pneumonia. Others die of respiratory paralysis. Endotracheal intubation should be performed at an early stage, when pooling of secretions in the pharynx becomes evident-before  obstruction  or  respiratory  arrest  has  developed.  If respiratory muscle power is inadequate, ventilation must be assisted. Patients have recovered from respiratory paralysis after being manually ventilated by relays of relatives or nurses for up to 30 days and after mechanical ventilation for up to 10 weeks. Most effects of neurotoxic envenoming are fully reversible; therefore, artificial ventilation should always be attempted.
Anticholinesterases have  a  variable,  but potentially  useful,  effect  in patients with neurotoxic envenoming, especially when postsynaptic neurotoxins are involved. The 'Tensilon test' can be performed, as with  suspected  myasthenia  gravis.  Atropine  sulphate  (0.6 mg  for adults; 50 μ g/kg for children) or glycopyrronium is given by IV injection followed by edrophonium chloride (Tensilon) by slow IV injection  in  an  adult  dose  of  10 mg  (0.25 mg/kg  for  children)  or neostigmine bromide or methylsulphate (Prostigmin) by intramuscular  injection  0.02 mg/kg  for  adults  (0.04 mg/kg  for  children). Patients  who  respond  convincingly  can  be  maintained  on  neostigmine methylsulphate, 0.5-2.5 mg every 1-3 hours up to 10 mg/24 hours maximum for adults or 0.01-0.04 mg/kg every 2-4 hours for children by intramuscular, IV or subcutaneous injection.

============================================================
CHUNK 101
============================================================
Circulatory collapse
Antivenom should be given, as well  as plasma  expanders. Clinical observation  of  jugular  venous  pressure  or  measurement  of  central venous pressure or pulmonary wedge pressure (via a Swan-Ganz catheter) helps to prevent fluid overload and precipitation of pulmonary
edema. If hypotension persists despite restoration of central venous pressure to + 10 to 15 cm H2O, an infusion of dopamine should be started  at  an  initial  dose  of  2 μ g/kg/minute  through  the  central catheter.

Local necrosis
Once  definite  signs  of  necrosis  have  appeared,  surgical  debridement  is  required,  with  antibiotic  prophylaxis  to  cover  anaerobic organisms.

CHUNK 103
============================================================
Intracompartmental syndrome and fasciotomy
Increased  pressure  within  tight  fascial  compartments,  such  as  the digital  pulp  spaces  and  anterior  tibial  compartment,  may  cause ischemia. Necrosis of digits is especially common. The signs are excessive  pain,  weakness  and  tenderness  of  the  compartmental  muscles and pain when they are passively stretched, hypoesthesia of skin supplied  by  nerves  running  through  the  compartment,  and  obvious tenseness of the compartment. Detection of arterial pulses by palpation  or  Doppler  does  not  exclude  intracompartmental  ischemia. Intracompartmental pressures exceeding 45 mmHg carry a high risk of ischemic necrosis. In these circumstances, fasciotomy may be justified,  but  it  did  not  prove  effective  in  saving  envenomed  muscle  in experimental  animals.  Fasciotomy  is  contraindicated  until  blood coagulability has been restored (by adequate doses of antivenom followed by clotting factors) and must be justified by demonstration that the intracompartmental pressure is consistently raised (to less than 30 mmHg below mean arterial pressure). Early adequate antivenom treatment will prevent the development of intracompartmental syndromes in most cases.

============================================================
CHUNK 104
============================================================
LOCAL INFECTION AT THE SITE OF THE BITE
Local infections may result from unusual bacteria derived from the snake's venom or fangs or contamination of the wound from asterile incisions. A booster dose of tetanus toxoid should be given, but prophylactic  antibiotics  are  not  indicated  unless  the  wound  has  been incised or tampered with in any way. If the wound is necrotic, Clostridium tetani should be eliminated with a large dose of benzyl penicillin or metronidazole and an aminoglycoside, such as gentamicin, given for  48 h.  If  a  local  abscess  develops,  it  should  be  drained  and  the patient given a course of antibiotics, such as penicillin, chloramphenicol or erythromycin, which are usually available and affordable.

============================================================
CHUNK 105
============================================================
Acute kidney injury
Some snake bite victims admitted with oliguria and elevated blood urea  nitrogen  and  creatinine  levels  are  simply  hypovolemic.  Urine output, serum creatinine, urea and electrolytes should be measured each day in patients with severe envenoming and in those bitten by species  known  to  cause  acute  kidney  injury.  If  urine  output  drops below 400 ml in 24 h, urethral and central venous catheters should be inserted. If urine flow fails to increase after cautious rehydration, diuretics should be tried (e.g. furosemide by slow intravenous injection,  100 mg  followed  by  200 mg)  and  then  mannitol.  Dopamine (2.5 μ g/kg per min by IV infusion) has proved effective in some cases. If these measures are ineffective, the patient should be placed on strict fluid balance. Peritoneal or hemodialysis will usually be required.

============================================================
CHUNK 106
============================================================
Other drugs
Heparin, antifibrinolytic agents (aprotinin, ε -aminocaproic acid), corticosteroids,  antihistamines  and a variety of  herbal  and  other remedies have been advocated for treatment of snakebite. None has proved effective and many are harmful.

Treatment of snake venom ophthalmia [7]
When cobra venom is 'spat' into the eyes, first-aid consists of irrigation with generous volumes of water or any other bland liquid, such as  milk-or  even  urine,  which  may  be  available.  Unless  a  corneal abrasion can be excluded by fluorescein staining or slit-lamp examination,  treatment  should  be  the  same  as  for  any  corneal  injury;  a topical antimicrobial such as tetracycline or chloramphenicol should be  applied.  Instillation  of  antivenom  is  not  recommended.  Epinephrine (0.1%) or local anesthetic eye drops relieve the pain.

INTRODUCTION [1, 2]
The medical importance of bats (Order Chiroptera) to human health is increasingly recognized. They are proven, or potential, reservoirs of zoonotic human pathogens and vectors. Transmission may be direct, by bat bites, scratches or more subtle contact; or indirect by infecting other mammalian hosts or by creating in their accumulated feces (bat guano)-a culture medium for pathogenic fungi whose spores may be inhaled by people entering bat caves. Bats may damage fruit crops, and  cattle  and  other  domestic  animals  are  vulnerable to  battransmitted  infections.  In  Latin  America,  vampire  bat-transmitted bovine rabies ('derriengue') and  trypanosomiasis ( Trypanosoma evansi infection  causing  'surra')  threatens  meat production.  Nipah virus causes fatal disease in pigs in Southeast Asia where epidemics have  led  to  the  culling  of  more  than  1  million  of  these  animals. Hendra, Menangle and Tioman viruses have been responsible for fatal diseases in horses and pigs in Australia and Malaysia. However, bats are much less important, medically and economically, than rodents. Rats,  mice  and  voles  are  vectors  and  reservoirs  of  many  prevalent zoonotic pathogens, such as Hanta- and Arena- viruses, plague bacillus, leptospires, rickettsiae and parastrongyloids. Rodents also consume crops and food stores and damage human dwellings and installations. In their favor, bats are fascinating and beautiful animals which are protected and conserved in many Western countries and which benefit the environment by controlling insects, pollinating fruit trees and distributing seeds. Bats are eaten medicinally in China and elsewhere and as a delicacy and valuable source of protein in West Africa,  Southeast  Asia,  Indonesia,  New  Guinea  and  Australia  (by native  Australians).  Catching  and  butchering  bats  and  consuming inadequately cooked bats incurs the risk of infection.

BAT BIOLOGY
Bats  have  a  number  of  special  characteristics,  some  of  which  are unique. They show extreme diversity, constituting 20% of all mammalian  species,  and  they  are  widely  distributed  in  all  continents except  Antarctica  and  some  oceanic  islands.  Some  species  breed within  the  Arctic  circle.  Bats  are  enormously  abundant,  sometimes occuring in colonies, flocks or clouds composed of as many as 20-30 million individual animals. In caves inhabited by Mexican free-tailed bats ( Tadarida brasiliensis ), there may be more than 3000 bats/m 3 in their  cave  roosts.  Bats  are  the  only  mammals  capable  of  flying,  as opposed to gliding. Some species migrate more than 1500 kilometers and North American hoary bats ( Lasiurus cinereus -Vespertilionidae) have reached Iceland and the Orkney Islands (UK). The wing membrane  is  formed  by  the  skin  of  the  back  and  belly,  supported  by elongated fingers, externally rotated and adducted legs and, in some cases, the tail. Some bats, such as true vampires, are also capable of quadrupedal gait. Most bats are nocturnal. They are the only vertebrates capable of catching insects in complete darkness, achieved by the use of sophisticated echolocation. Bats are variously insectivorous, frugivorous,  flower-feeding,  hematophagous  or  carnivorous.  Their weight  ranges  from  2 g  (one  of  the  tiniest  vertebrates)  to  1.2 kg. Metabolic flexibility allows them to be heterothermic (extreme variation in body core temperature 2-41°C) and to hibernate. They are the  longest-living  of  tiny  mammals  (e.g .  Myotis  lucifugus ,  weighing only 7 g, has lived to 35 years). Bats roost, hanging upside down from their feet or clinging onto surfaces, in human constructions such as roof spaces, eaves and attics of dwellings (bringing them into close contact with people), tombs, temples, mines, pipes, irrigation tunnels and bridges and in caves, rock crevices, foliage, tree cavities, trees and bird and termite nests. Some species can fashion tent-like shelters out of leaves. Recently, an epidemic of white-nosed syndrome has killed more  than  a  million  bats  in  the  north-east  USA.  A  cold-growing fungus, Geomyces  destructans ,  has  been  implicated

Diaemus and Diphylla feed largely on birds, while Desmodus prefers mammals, especially large domestic herbivores. Self-sharpening incisor and canine teeth are modified to allow painless venesection. The vampire's saliva flows  down  a  groove  on  the  dorsal  surface  of  its  tongue  into  the wound. Salivary toxins increase capillary permeability, inhibit platelet aggregation, inhibit activated factors X and IX ('draculin') and activate plasminogen ('desmoteplase'-currently being developed as a thrombolytic drug, DSPA-alpha-1).

Predation is facilitated by vampires' ability to clamber, hop and spring using their hind legs and enlarged thumb (Fig. 134.6.7). Vampires can regurgitate blood when they return to the roost, feeding not only their  young and relatives, but also other members of  the colonyaltruistic behavior that is unique among animals.

vampire  bat  attacks  and  fatal  human  illness.  Ecologic  changes, such  as  destruction  of  forest  and  introduction  of  cattle  ranching, construction  of  trans-Amazonian  highways,  the  invasion  of  newlyaccessible jungle by gold miners and electric power failures, have led to small epidemics of human rabies transmitted by vampires. These have accounted for more than 500 deaths since 1975, usually affecting rural communities of indigenous Amerindians, such as the Warao

in north-east Venezuela. There have been recent outbreaks in Colombia (Chocó , Santander), Peru (Condorcanqui, Bagna, Puerto Maldanado,  Ayacucho),  Brazil  (Para,  Maranhão)  and  Venezuela  (Delta Amacuro). Humans are bitten at night on their extremities, ears and faces. Children appear particularly vulnerable. They may not wake up but discover bleeding wounds showing a double puncture made by the  incisors  (Fig.  134.6.12)  or  a  depressed  lesion  with  raised  edge (Figs  134.6.13  and  134.6.14)  in  the  morning.  Mosquito  nets  are normally  protective  but  accessible  body  parts  may  be  attacked and  the  vampire's  melena  stool  may  be  found  staining  the  net (Fig.  134.6.15). Historical epidemics of vampire bat rabies, such as occurred in Trinidad from 1929, were characterized by predominantly paralytic disease, but a minority of patients develop hydrophobia and other features of furious rabies. Vampire bat-related strains of classic Genotype 1 rabies virus have been found in many South American wild and domestic mammals and have been transmitted to humans, for example by pet marmosets in Brazil.

Prevention and control of vampire bat rabies [6]
People, especially children, living in areas where vampire bat bites are common should, ideally, be protected by rabies pre-exposure immunization, but this is rarely practicable. However, the high risk of fatal rabies in affected communities (e.g. 16 of 57 people bitten by vampires in one village in north-east Brazil) reflects the inaccessibility of post-exposure  prophylaxis.  Bat  proofing  of  dwellings  and  sleeping under mosquito nets affords some protection and electric house lighting may deter vampires. Vampires are highly susceptible to anticoagulants, such as warfarin, which can be distributed to vampire colonies by capturing the bats and releasing them after plastering them with warfarin paste. Treatment of cattle with controlled doses of warfarin will  kill  vampires  feeding  on  them.  Cattle  can be  vaccinated  using adjuvanted Pasteur Virus strain (PV) vaccine and vampires themselves with recombinant vaccinia-vaccine.

Non-vampire bat rabies
In  the  USA,  30 of the  40  cases  of  human  rabies  reported  between 1995 and 2008 were attributed to bat strains of Genotype 1 rabies virus. Fifteen were associated with Lasionycteris noctivagans or Pipistrellus subflavus, 1 1 with Tadarida brasiliensis, and 1 each with Myotis spp . and Eptesicus fuscus. However, there was a clear history of a bat bite in only a few of these cases, although some had been in direct contact with bats and others had bats in their homes. This suggests the possibility of subtle contact such as the bat's licking an open wound or intact mucous membranes of a sleeping person [7, 8]. Bat strains of Genotype 1 appear more tolerant of low temperatures and are more able to replicate in endothelial cells than canine strains of Genotype 1. The survival of three American children from bat-transmitted rabies may also suggest decreased virulence of bat strains. Aerosol transmission of rabies was claimed to explain infection of two visitors to Frio Caves in Texas inhabited by 20-30 million T. brasilensis , but it is far more likely that they were infected transdermally.
In Asia, evidence of serotype 1 infection was found in insectivorous and frugivorous bats in Cambodia and China.

Genotype 2 Lagos Bat Virus (LGV)
Lyssavirus Genotype 2 is grouped together with Genotype 3 Mokola virus (not found in bats) in Phylogroup II. Although human disease has not been reported, direct or serologic evidence of Lagos bat virus (LGV) infection has been found in several species of fruit bats (Pteropodidae) in Africa: the very widely distributed straw-coloured fruit bat
( Eidolon helvum ) that is often eaten as 'bush meat', epauletted fruit bats ( Epomophorsu, Epomops and Micropteropus spp.), Egyptian rousettes ( Rousettus aegyptiacus ); and in vespertilionid species: long-winged bats ( Miniopterus spp.) and Gambian slit-faced bats ( Nycteris gambiensis ). A new LGV-like lyssavirus (Shomoni virus) has been described in a Commerson's  leaf-nosed  bat  ( Hipposideros  commersoni )  in  coastal Kenya.  Seroprevalence  of  LGV  is  30-70%  in R.  aegyptiacus and E. helvum . Serologic evidence of LGV-like infection was found in insectivorous and frugivorous bats in Cambodia.

Genotype 4 Duvenhage virus
Lyssavirus Genotype 4 has been found in insectivorous and frugivorous  bats,  such  as  the  Egyptian  slit-faced  bat  ( Nycteris  thebaica -Nycteridae), the common bent-wing bat ( Miniopterus schreibersii ) and other  vespertilionid  species  in  east  and  southern  Africa.  The  three identified  human cases  in  South  Africa  and  Kenya  showed  clinical features indistinguishable from classic rabies encephalomyelitis.

Genotype 5 and 6 European Bat Lyssavirus (EBLV)
This genotype is the only zoonotic virus in European bats. European bat  lyssaviurs  (EBLV)-1  infection  has  been  found  in  sorentine  bats ( Eptesicus  sorentinus )  and R.  aegyptiacus and  EBLV-2 in  Daubenton's bats  ( Myotis  daubentonii ),  pond  bats  ( Myotis  dasycneme )  and  other Myotis spp. and greater horseshoe bats ( Rhinolophus ferrumequinum ).

Genotype 7 Australian Bat Lyssavirus (ABLV)
Genotype 7 Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) was first isolated from a black  flying  fox  ( Pteropus  alecto )  in  New  South Wales  in  1996  and subsequently  from  three  other  species  of  flying  fox  ( Pteropus  poliocephalus , Pteropus scapulatus, Pteropus conspicillatus ) and one species of insectivorous  bat,  the  yellow-bellied  sheath  tailed  bat  ( Saccolaimus flaviventris -Emballonuridae). Two Queensland women died of diseases  indistinguishable  from  classic  rabies,  one  five  weeks  after scratches by a S. flaviventris and the other more than two years after bites by a flying fox. In the Philippines, ABLV has been found in Lyle's flying foxes ( Pteropis lylei ) obtained from restaurants, and in Miniopterus schreibersii and great round-leafed bats ( Hipposideros armiger ) in Cambodia and Thailand.

Other rabies-related viruses
Aravan (Kyrghistan), Khujand (Tajikistan), Irkut (Siberia) and West Caucasian bat lyssaviruses ( Phylogroup I) have not yet been classified. They have been isolated in one African and one Eurasian bat. Serologic evidence of West Caucasian bat virus was found in long-winged bats ( Miniopterus spp.-Vespertilionidae) in Kenya and of Aravan and Khujand  bat  viruses in Indian fruit bats ( Pteropus giganteus -Pteropodidae) in Bangladesh, Irkut and in Thailand ( Pteropus lylei ). No transmission to humans has been described.

FILOVIRUSES: MARBURG VIRUS AND EBOLA VIRUS [9, 10]
The  environmental  reservoirs  and  vectors  of  these  deadly  hemorrhagic fevers have long been debated, but, in Uganda, serologic and PCR evidence of Ebola and Marburg virus infections has been found in Egyptian fruit bats or rousettes ( R. aegyptiacus ), suggesting that this species  may  be  a  natural  host  of  both  viruses.  Evidence  of  Lake Victoria Marburg virus has been found in R . aegyptiacus in Kitum Cave, Mount Elgon, Kenya, and Python and Kitaka Caves in Uganda-sites where humans have been infected. Touching bat feces or being hit by low-flying bats were identified as possible risk factors for acquisition of the infection. Insectivorous bats, such as greater long-fingered bats Miniopterus  inflatus (Vespertilionidae),  and horseshoe bats ( Rhinolophus elocuens ) and round leaf bats ( Hipposideros spp. Rhinolophidae) have also been implicated in Gabon, Democratic Republic of Congo and  Uganda.  In  Democratic  Republic  of  Congo,  hunting  of  bats, such as migratory hammer-headed or big-lipped bats ( Hypsignathus
monstrosus Pteropodidae) for human consumption was linked to the 2007 outbreak of Ebola virus. In the Philippines, Ebola virus Reston has been found in domestic pigs. Several asymptomatic human infections were reported.

PARAMYXOVIRUSES (NIPAH, HENDRA, MENANGLE) [11]
Three  emerging  paramyxovirus  infections  have  been  described  for which bats are the likely natural reservoirs and domestic horses and pigs have proved to be the amplifying vectors for human infection. Hendra  and  Nipah  viruses are Henipaviruses; Menangle  is a rubulavirus.

CHUNK 134
============================================================
Hendra virus [12]
In 1994, there was an outbreak of fatal respiratory disease in horses and humans in Australia, attributed to a new pathogen, Hendra virus, whose natural reservoir is Pteropus spp. ( P.  alecto, P .  poliocephalus,  P. scapulatus, P. conspicillatus ). There have been 13 subsequent outbreaks. In 2008, 2009 and 201 1, equine and human victims showed primarily encephalitic features. Among six human cases, three died.

============================================================
CHUNK 135
============================================================
Nipah virus [11]
In 1998, there was an epidemic of encephalitis in Malaysia and Singapore affecting pigs and pig-handlers in whom the case fatality was more than 40%. The causative virus, named Nipah after an affected village, is closely related to Hendra virus. Pteropus vampyrus and Pteropus  hypomelanus are  the  natural  reservoirs.  There  were  outbreaks  in Bangladesh  in  2001,  2003  and  2004  (case  fatality > 74%)  and  in adjacent West Bengal in 2001. So far, more than 440 human cases of Nipah virus encephalitis have been diagnosed. The epidemics have been attributed  to  disruption  of  Pteropus  ecology  by  deforestation (e.g. building the new Kuala Lumpur airport), which displaced the bats from their traditional roosts to agricultural areas where they have contact with domestic animals and humans. In Bangladesh, where there have been 130 deaths, human-to-human transmission within families has been inferred.
Menangle and Tioman viruses have been isolated from Pteropus spp. in Australia and Malaysia, and from sick pigs. Influenza-like illness in pig farmers with Menangle sero-conversion has been reported.

OTHER VIRUSES
Many of the other viruses that have been isolated from bats have not been proved to be either transmissible to humans, directly or indirectly, or to cause human disease. These include severe acute respiratory  syndrome  (SARS)  viruses  [13],  the  Arenavirus  Tacaribe  virus, Orthoreoviruse  Nelson  Bay  virus  [14],  Mojuí  dos  Campos,  Bimiti, Catu,  Guama,  Manzanilla,  Nepuyo,  Oriboca,  Montana myotis  leukoencephalitis, Tamana bat, Nepuyo, Catu, Mount Elgon bat, Entebbe and Astroviruses.

BACTERIAL INFECTIONS
Leptospira and Brucella have both been reported to occur naturally in bats. Leptospira-infected bats are found in Asia and Europe, as well as the Americas. Brucella infection has been found in vampire bats in Brazil.  Bats  can  be  infected  with  enteric  bacteria  such  as Samonella spp. and Escherichia coli ,  but transmission to humans has not been reported. Transmission of Hansen's disease ( Mycobacterium leprosum ) by vampire bats has been suspected but not proven.

CHUNK 138
============================================================
Histoplasmosis
Bat  guano  provides  a  rich  medium  for  the  growth  of Histoplasma capsulatum ; environment in the bat roost fosters this growth. Humans exposed to dried guano have suffered massive infection and death by inhalation.

============================================================
CHUNK 139
============================================================
OTHER FUNGI
Many other  fungi  have  been  found  in  association  with  bat  roosts, including Candida and Scopulariopsis and Geomyces spp.  (including White-Nosed Syndrome (WNS) fungus of bats see above), which can infect humans. The involvement of bats seems limited to the provision of a rich environment in the roost as a culture medium for these organisms.

============================================================
CHUNK 140
============================================================
PROTOZOA
Trypanosoma evansi , the causative agent of surra in domestic animals, has been demonstrated in vampire bats. These bats can mechanically transmit the trypanosome from host to host. Trypanosoma cruzi has been  reported  also,  but  evidence  for  transmission  to  humans  is lacking.

============================================================
PREVENTION OF BATGTRANSMITTED INFECTIONS
For measures against vampire bat rabies see above. Ideally, bats and humans should not share the same microenvironment, but bats are rightly protected in many countries and so expert advice should be sought if they are found roosting in attics. An aggressive bat is likely to be unwell, perhaps rabid. All case of scratches, bites and possible mucosal contact should be reviewed for possible post-exposure rabies prophylaxis. Even the handling of a dead bat has been associated with transmission.  Grounded,  trapped  or  sick  bats  should,  ideally,  be handled only by experts and never without gloves. The risk of inhaling aerosolized  fungal  spores  and  acquiring  other  bat-related  diseases must be recognized by cave explorers (spelunkers) and prevented by wearing appropriate clothing and masks.
