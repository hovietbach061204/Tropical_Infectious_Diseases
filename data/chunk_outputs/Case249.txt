- infectious agents, important in|ammatory dermatoses also occur.
- eruptive dermatologic condition, the primary morphology of the lesion is the most important factor.
- therapy of most cutaneous disorders. However, exceptions exist, particularly when treating individuals with cutaneous manifestations of systemic infectious, in|ammatory, or autoimmune conditions, including bullous disorders such as pemphigus.
- its distribution is not suf{cient for diagnosis, skin biopsy may be indicated.

VESICLES/BULLAE
Vesicles  and  bullae  are  watery,  clear,  |uid-{lled  lesions  on  the skin. Herpetic involvement of the skin classically includes a vesicular phase, and is among the most common dermatoses encountered by the clinician. Herpetic vesicles lie on an erythematous base, and the lesions ulcerate and eventually heal with crusting that can last for 2 weeks. 1 Traditionally, herpetic ulcers show a scalloped border with serosanguinous drainage, pain at the site, and occasionally  ipsilateral  lymphadenopathy.  Chronic  disease  may  lead  to scarring. The patient experiences early dysesthesias, such as tingling, burning,  or  pruritus  at  the  site,  hours  to  days  before  a  future eruption in  recurrent  disease. 2 Most  importantly,  the  diagnosis should be suspected in those with chronic ulcers, particularly if they are immunosuppressed. 3 Though herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 is more common in orofacial disease and HSV-2 in genital lesions, both strains can be seen in either location. Often a {xed location in the body is noted; however, primary disease can affect any area of the body.

Zoster infection is caused by reactivation of varicella virus that has  lain  dormant  in  basal  root  ganglia  since  primary  infection (chickenpox). However, unlike the initial diffuse vesicular rash of chickenpox, herpes zoster usually presents with croplike vesicles along a dermatome distribution. 4,5 Zoster can disseminate, especially in immunocompromised patients. More than 20 lesions outside a dermatome should raise suspicion for dissemination. 6 Ulcerations may be chronic, especially in immunocompromised patients. 7 It is important to consider a diagnosis of herpes zoster, particularly when a steroid-responsive diagnosis such as pseudo-vesicular Sweet' s syndrome (or idiopathic neutrophilic dermatosis) is considered, as  oral  steroid  use  in  patients  with  disseminated  zoster  can  be lethal. The occasionally necrotic center of evolving lesions may easily be confused for a primary vasculitis. It is important to note, however,  that  vasculitis  seen  in  the  setting  of  zoster  is  usually reactive and not a primary disease requiring steroids or cytotoxic medication, even when it is clearly present on skin biopsy. 8

Stephen J. Lockwood, Arturo Saavedra, David Rosmarin immunoglobulins against intra-epidermal desmoglein-1 destroy inter-cellular connections leading to single cell detachment. 9 As little to no desmoglein-1 is expressed in mucosal skin, pemphigus foliaceous is primarily a disease of cutaneous surfaces, sparing the eyes  and  mouth. The  blisters  in  pemphigus  foliaceous  are  not tense, but |accid (Fig. 8.1). They are readily expanded when side pressure is exerted, and further separation is created between the super{cial layers of skin (the so-called Nikolsky's sign ). It is important to highlight, however, that vesicles and bullae may only be seen in the acute, early phases of disease. Because these blisters are so fragile,  by  the  time  the  patient  presents  for  care,  the  physical examination is notable for crusted and scaly papules, erosions, or even psoriatic-like disease. The disease is strikingly photosensitive, so that the scalp and upper extremities and shawl distribution may be disproportionately affected. Lesions may be single, con|uent, or, in some cases, affect the entire skin surface. 10 Fogo salvageum, an endemic form of pemphigus foliaceus, refers to a prominent, intensely in|ammatory response with vesicles and bullae that can follow a |y bite or other environmental trigger in areas of South America. It is usually treated with steroids. 11 Pemphigus erythematosus, or Senear-Usher syndrome, is used to refer to pemphigus lesions localized to the malar region of the face. 10

VASCULAR PAPULES AND NODULES (ANGIOMATOUS LESIONS)
Angiomatous lesions are reddish papules or nodules due to vascular proliferation and dilatation. Kaposi's sarcoma, verruga peruana, pyogenic  granulomas,  cherry  angiomas,  and  pseudo-Kaposi's sarcoma can all present with these vascular lesions. If  they  are more nodular and deeper in the skin, the angiomata may appear violaceous.
Kaposi's sarcoma due to human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) is in the differential diagnosis of angiomatous lesions, and it is necessary to biopsy the lesion to ascertain the diagnosis. Lesions begin as macules, but develop into papules and then nodules, with symmetric, widespread, reddish, violaceous, or blue-black lesions (Fig. 8.2). 8 Edema can  be  an  accompanying  sign. There  are  {ve  different types, with the AIDS-associated type commonly being the presenting manifestation that leads to a diagnosis of HIV . Gastrointestinal and pulmonary involvement by Kaposi's sarcoma can lead to death from hemorrhage, hemoptysis, or bowel obstruction.
Bacillary angiomatosis caused by Bartonella henselae and B. quintana most commonly affects immunosuppressed patients. 12 Red, angiomatous papules or nodules are very characteristic. The lesions may bleed and erode and cause regional lymphadenopathy, as well as peliosis-blood-{lled cystic spaces in the liver and spleen.
Cat scratch disease is mainly caused by B. henselae from a cat scratch or bite of an infected |ea. What starts as a non-tender, erythematous papule at the site of inoculation develops into regional lymphadenopathy within 1 to 2 months in the draining lymph nodes. Usually the lymphadenopathy is self-limited, lasting only a  few  months. The  inoculation  site  may  also  become  vesicular and  crusted.  In  Parinaud's  oculoglandular  syndrome,  there  is preauricular  lymphadenopathy  from  the  conjunctival  site  of Bartonella inoculation.

PETECHIAE AND PURPURA
Purpura is blood that has leaked out of the vasculature into the skin but remains visible. If it occurs as small spots, it is referred to as petechiae; if it occurs in larger areas and in deeper structures, it is called ecchymoses. Characteristically, purpura will not blanch under pressure because the erythrocytes have  escaped  into the tissue  and  are  no  longer  within  compressible vessels.  Common causes  of  purpura  include  coagulopathies,  trauma,  nutritional de{ciencies, vasculitides (Fig. 8.3), medicines such as aspirin and warfarin, and infections.
Rickettsial diseases have a predilection for the microvasculature, often  causing  petechiae.  During  louse-borne  epidemic  typhus
Mite-borne scrub typhus is caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi, a gram-negative coccobacillus, and the primary skin lesion is an erythematous, painless papule  at  the  site  of  inoculation  by  the mite, which is commonly in the genital area or legs. The original papule may form a vesicle and ultimately evolve into an ulcer with a necrotic eschar and surrounding indurated erythema with regional lymphadenopathy. 14 Blood vessels within the central nervous system may be affected, resulting in meningitis, tinnitus, and even deafness in untreated cases. 15
Patients with rickettsial spotted fevers such as RMSF, Mediterranean spotted fever, North Asian tick typhus, and others most frequently present with fever, headache, and an initially pink macular eruption  on  the  extremities  that  spreads  centripetally  and  may develop  into  an  erythematous  papular  eruption  that  becomes hemorrhagic and petechial. Though the face is often spared, the palms and soles are frequently involved, which should raise the suspicion of rickettsial illness. 16

PETECHIAE AND PURPURA
Patients with bacterial meningitis due to Neisseria meningitides often present with fever and rash, with the latter classically including petechiae. A useful clue is {nding lesions on areas of skin pressure such as at the waist, where belts are worn, or shoulders, where a strap may have been resting. A patient may lack the hemorrhagic signs and only have a morbilliform exanthem, even in the setting of photophobia and nuchal rigidity. The presence and extent of petechiae are important to note, as they correlate with the severity
of thrombocytopenia and the risk for serious bleeding complications. 17
Patients with leptospirosis caused by spirochetes of the genus Leptospira can present with fever, hepatic and renal dysfunction, conjunctival suffusion, jaundice, and a petechial eruption. 18-20
Patients with dengue fever may present with petechial lesions. The rash in dengue may extend to the trunk and does not resemble dependent  vasculitis,  as  is  seen  in  leukocytoclastic  vasculitis. Hyperemia  and  a  diffuse  macular  rash  with  central  islands  of sparing may be noted. 21
Patients with Ebola caused by the Ebola virus endemic to areas of Africa typically get pinpoint papules around hair roots, in addition to other macules and papules starting 4 to 5 days after fever with |ulike symptoms, and may progress to a diffuse erythroderma.

ULCERS/VERRUCOUS PLAQUES
Many diseases begin as an ulcer and later develop into a verrucous or warty plaque. Mycobacterial infections, leishmaniasis, rickettsialpox, anthrax, plague, diphtheria, rhinosporidiosis, and mycoses are examples.
Tuberculosis (TB) primarily affects the lung, although it can occasionally primarily involve the skin, and disease can be categorized as being from direct inoculation from an exogenous source, from an endogenous source, or from hematogenous spread. 22 After direct inoculation of TB into the skin, a {rm, red-brown papule may develop that ultimately ulcerates into a chancre and is covered by a dark, adherent crust. A papule forming a verrucous plaque with centrifugal progression and central scarring caused by direct contact is called tuberculosis verrucosa cutis. Sometimes the bacteriarich ulcer is associated with erythema nodosum and may eventually spontaneously heal.
When there is  contiguous  spread  from  underlying  necrotic tuberculoid lymph nodes, the underlying skin may become involved in  scrofuloderma.  This  form  of  cutaneous  TB  is  particularly common among young children. The neck is the most common site  of  involvement. A  {rm,  deep,  adherent,  purple-red  nodule may become |uctuant, suppurate, or ulcerate and form a {stula. Less commonly, self-inoculation near natural ori{ces can lead to tuberculosis cutis ori{cialis that appears as yellow-red nodules in or  near  the  mucosa.  These  lesions  frequently  ulcerate  and  are tender.

In hematogenous spread, TB disseminates from a primary site to other locations. The most common form, lupus vulgaris, is a destructive process that usually involves the face, leaving central atrophy. It may be caused by TB or after bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine.  Lupus vulgaris  needs to be differentiated  from leishmaniasis, sarcoidosis, discoid lupus erythematosus, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, tuberculoid leprosy, pyodermatitis vegetans, and paracoccidioidomycosis.  Dermatologic  manifestations  of  disseminated miliary TB include papules and pustules that are diffusely distributed throughout the body and are more common in children and those that are severely immunosuppressed.
From hypersensitivity reactions to TB, {rm, pustulonecrotic, symmetric papules called tuberculids may  form  on  the  extensor surfaces that resolve over several weeks. Another tuberculid, lichen scrofulosorum, consists of tiny, |at-topped, keratotic papules on the trunk that grow in groups. Erythema induratum appears as symmetric, erythematous, subcutaneous nodules on the posterior calves  with  overlying  atrophy  and  slight  scale,  commonly  in middle-aged women. It is thought to be a hypersensitivity reaction during TB. Erythema nodosum may appear similar, but is more often on the shins, is more painful, and does not ulcerate.

Skin lesions can also be due to non-TB mycobacteria. Although non-TB tuberculoid can be contracted from soil, water, |ora, and fauna,  human-to-human  transmission  does  not  occur.  Rapidly growing Mycobacterium fortuitum and M. chelonae/abscessus can cause subcutaneous abscesses or cellulitides. M. marinum from aquariums and  lakes  can  lead  to  erosions,  verrucous  papules,  or  plaques. M. marinum, M. kansasii, and other non-tuberculous mycobacteria can  cause  lesions  in  a  sporotrichoid  (lymphangitic)  pattern. M. ulcerans is the cause of Buruli ulcer, a chronic ulcerating process that {rst manifests as a solitary, indurated, painless nodule that may be pruritic and ulcerate. Buruli ulcers most often affect children living in Australia and Africa, and less frequently, in Latin America. M.  haemophilum occurs  in  children  and  immunocompromised patients with lymphadenitis and tender, nodular lesions that lead to purulent ulcers.
Rickettsialpox is caused by Rickettsia akari and is transmitted by the bite of rodent-associated mites. At the site of inoculation, an  erythematous  papule  {rst  occurs  and  then  develops  into  a vesicle that then ruptures and ulcerates. 23

Cutaneous anthrax caused by Bacillus anthracis is  usually due to contact with livestock, animal products, or soil. 24 After a 2- to 7-day incubation period, there is a papule which is preceded by pruritus at the site of inoculation. Vesicles may surround the papule and  coalesce  until  there  is  rupture  and  formation  of  a  4-  to 6-centimeter ulcer. There is signi{cant perilesional edema. The ulcer  develops  a  thick,  black,  depressed,  painless  eschar  that  is characteristic of the disease. Cutaneous infection can cause systemic illness.  In  addition  to  the  cutaneous  form  of  anthrax,  which represents 95% of cases, there is gastrointestinal and pulmonary anthrax that follow ingestion and inhalation of spores, respectively.
Plague is caused by Yersinia pestis carried by |eas and is maintained  in  a  number  of  rodent  reservoirs. 25 At  the  site  of  a  |ea bite, a papule, pustule, vesicle, ulcer, or eschar may develop, and patients have high fever and appear systemically ill. Regional lymph nodes may become swollen, warm, and very tender (buboes) after 2 to 6 days of incubation.
Cutaneous  diphtheria  caused  by Corynebacterium  diphtheriae presents in a variety of ways, including painful ulcers with rolled edges and surrounding erythema and edema. 26 Infection of  the respiratory tract causes a low-grade fever, sore throat, and purulent nasal discharge, which may become erosive. An adherent grayish pseudo-membrane  may  develop  on  the  tonsils  with  signi{cant 'bull neck' cervical edema and lymphadenopathy.

In Old World cutaneous leishmaniasis, a pruritic papule {rst forms at the site of a sand |y bite within a few days to weeks. 27 After this, a well-de{ned painless ulcer with surrounding erythema, crusting, and variable pyoderma develops. Lymphadenopathy is common. There  may  be  undermined  ulcer  edges  that  can  be confused  for  smaller  lesions  of  pyoderma  gangrenosum.  Most lesions heal over 6 to 24 months with minimal scarring, atrophy, or depigmentation.
In  diffuse  cutaneous  leishmaniasis  (DCL),  the  initial  papule rarely ulcerates. Instead, several other papules develop, with minimal erythema or pigmentation outwardly spreading from the initial site. As  lesions evolve, they may become deeper and nodular. A chronic form of cutaneous disease called leishmania recidivans causes sarcoidal-appearing  lesions,  with  outwardly  enlarging  dermal induration and central clearance. If pressed against a glass slide, the erythematous to violaceous coloration and dusky nature of the lesion may blanch into an 'apple-green' appearance, re|ecting the presence of histiocytes and other chronic in|ammatory cells in tissue. Post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) refers to diffuse nodular  involvement  that  occurs  after  resolution  of  visceral leishmaniasis (kala azar).
Cutaneous New World  leishmaniasis appears  similar  to  the Old World variant. A speci{c New World mucocutaneous manifestation of L. baziliensis is termed espundia. After resolution of a primary skin lesion, leishmania infection can relapse, speci{cally involving oro-naso-mucosal membranes, including the nasal septum, pharynx, larynx, and buccal mucosa. Untreated, mucocutaneous leishmaniasis can be dis{guring and can result in central destruction of the face.

Subcutaneous Mycoses
Direct inoculation of a fungus into the skin, often by a splinter or other trauma, may result in subcutaneous mycoses. Clinically, subcutaneous mycoses result in an ulcer or verrucous plaque. The most common types are sporotrichosis, mycetoma, chromoblastomycosis, phaeohyphomycosis, and lobomycosis. Treatment can be  dif{cult  and  may  require  long  courses  of  oral  antifungals, cryotherapy, or surgical excision alone or in combination.
Sporotrichosis is caused by S. schencki and follows direct inoculation classically involving thorns or cats' claws. Lymphangitic spread is common. Chromoblastomycosis usually manifests as a classic verrucous  plaque.  Central  atrophy  with  scarring  may  be  seen. Chromoblastomycosis is due to dematiaceous (melanin producing) fungi, often Fonsecaea pedrosoi, and most commonly involves the lower extremities of individuals involved in soil-related occupations (Fig. 8.4). Phaeohyphomycosis can manifest in several ways, most commonly as black eschars with scalloped, erythematous borders. Subcutaneous abscesses should be excised. Lobomycosis due to Lacazia loboi is reported in areas of Latin America and manifests as asymptomatic, smooth-surfaced, keloidal lesions, often on the ear.
Mycetoma, or Madura foot, is caused by bacteria (actinomycetoma) or fungi (eumycetoma). The clinical presentation is one of an asymptomatic, subcutaneous swelling with sinus tracts that discharge 'granules' or 'grains.' Granules from bacteria tend to be lighter in color, whereas granules from fungi tend to be dark. Radiologic imaging should be performed, as bone involvement is common.

Zygomycoses  are  divided  into  two  types:  the  opportunistic type typi{ed by mucormycosis that affects hosts immunosuppressed by diseases other than AIDS, such as diabetes; and entomophthoromycosis that affects immunocompetent hosts living in the tropics. Mucormycosis commonly presents around the nose, forming black, necrotic tissue and involving the orbit and brain, whereas entomophthoromycosis  forms  a  solitary,  painless  nodule  or  slowly expansile mass, most commonly on an extremity.

Deep Mycoses
Aside from subcutaneous mycoses, deep cutaneous fungal infections often result from systemic infection. The cutaneous presentations are  protean.  Sometimes,  cutaneous  infection  causes  erythema nodosum-sterile, tender, erythematous nodules on the shin that have a favorable prognosis. Other times, there is a non-speci{c presentation such as a morbilliform eruption. Accompanying signs and symptoms of fever, gastrointestinal upset, and emaciation aid in the diagnosis of a systemic infection.
Histoplasmosis may present with mucocutaneous ulcerations and granulomas. Care must be taken not to misdiagnose as sarcoidosis. Blastomycosis is endemic in North America and often affects bone, particularly ribs and vertebrae, along with the skin. The  cutaneous  lesions  are  multiple  and  grow  slowly,  forming verrucous and granulomatous lesions with thick crust overlying granulation  tissue  and  sometimes  central  white  scars.  Paracoccidioidomycosis  is  endemic  in  Latin America  and  may  present with mucocutaneous disease, most commonly of the gingiva, with small papules and ulcerations. Penicilliosis (caused by Talaromyces [ Penicillium ] marneffei )  is  endemic in Southeast Asia, sometimes causing umbilicated papules or oral lesions. Cryptococcus has an af{nity for the central nervous system and skin. In patients with AIDS, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, penicilliosis, and molluscum contagiosum may all appear as umbilicated vesicles and be clinically indistinguishable.

PAINLESS PAPULES
Molluscum contagiosum manifests as umbilicated, dome-shaped papules that can coalesce into plaques. 28 Clinicians may confuse the diagnosis with herpetic disease, but relatively simple bedside maneuvers can assist in diagnosis. Lancing lesions of molluscum leads to extravasation of a 'white cheesy material,' which can be stained with hematoxylin and eosin, revealing eosinophilic globules. In a patient with an unknown HIV status, con|uent facial molluscum contagiosum is a reason to test for HIV. Therapy is often via destruction with curettage, cryotherapy, or reconstitution of the immune system in those with de{ciencies.
Warts due to numerous types of human papillomavirus (HPV) cause verrucous, asymptomatic, hyperkeratotic papules that interrupt the natural skin lines. Often central black dots can be seen representing capillaries. There are many types, including common warts (verruca vulgaris), |at warts (verruca plana), plantar warts (verruca  plantaris),  and  {liform  warts,  as  well  as  genital  warts (condyloma acuminatum) that are sexually transmitted. High-risk HPV types such as 16, 18, 31, and 33, among others, are associated with cervical and anal cancer and are often anteceded by dysplasia. Epidermodysplasia verruciformis is an autosomal-recessive genetic disease where patients have uncontrolled growth of HPV , typically HPV type 5 and 8, leading to numerous |at-topped papules as well as coalescing cutaneous horns.

PAINFUL PAPULES/URTICARIA
Infestation of skin with |y larvae is called myiasis . A large, tender, cystlike  structure  or  papule  may  be  noted  with  surrounding erythema, a central punctum, and occasional suppuration. 29 Patients usually  report  movement  within  the  lesions.  Lesions  may  be multiple, and one larva is usually found within each lesion. New World myiasis is caused by Dermatobia hominis, colloquially known as  the botRy; Old  World  disease  is  most  commonly  caused  by Cordylobia anthropophaga, known as the tumbu Ry. Treatment involves asphyxiating  the  larvae,  usually  via  application  of  an  occlusive dressing or substance, followed by larval extrusion. Surgical excision may sometimes be required. Bacterial supra-infection can occur.
Tungiasis (also called jiggers ) is caused by Tunga penetrans, the sand |ea. The female |ea burrows into skin, usually on the feet,
but can involve any exposed skin area, creating a callus-like papule, often with some hyperpigmentation. The terminus of the |ea is often visible in the center of the lesion. Pain is usually present, and ulceration can occur. T reatment involves mechanical removal. 30

PRURITUS AND PAPULES
Schistosomal cercarial dermatitis ('swimmer's itch') can occur at the site of skin penetration with the infectious form of Schistosoma spp. after water exposure. Non-human Schistosome spp., especially avian species,  can  cause  prominent  dermatitis  that  manifests  as multiple highly pruritic, erythematous papules. Distribution is of skin exposed to infectious water, most often affecting the legs and feet. 31 Seabather's eruption can cause similar lesions but is caused by larval forms of coelenterates (jelly{sh), but distribution usually re|ects a 'bathing suit' distribution, because the larvae become entrapped by clothing. 1
Pediculosis (or lice) is  caused by louse infestation. Different lice are responsible for each form of human involvement: corporis (body), capitis (head), and pubis ('crabs'). Louse infestation can result  in  pruritus  and  excoriations.  The  body  louse  ( Pediculus humanus corporis ) takes a daily blood meal, but lives in clothing. It is transmitted from person to person, usually in overcrowded and impoverished conditions and during periods of war and social unrest. The head louse ( P. humanus capitis ) is also transmitted from person  to  person  and  is  particularly  common  in  school-aged children. Pubic lice ( Phthirus pubis )  is  spread  by  sexual  contact, and infestation may result in intense pruritus in the groin. Lice can be seen adhering to pubic hair. Symptoms are regional, although lice and nits may occasionally be seen on eyelashes. 5 In cases of protracted infestation, pale blue macules may develop as a manifestation  of  louse  anticoagulant  secreted  in  saliva  during  feedings. Regional lymphadenopathy may be present in some patients.

PRURITUS AND PAPULES
Scabies is an infestation caused by Sarcoptes scabei mites. The organism  burrows  super{cially,  just  underneath  the  stratum corneum. It does not penetrate the skin, and as such it is not a true infection. Contrary to common belief, dermatitis does not occur immediately after infestation. Dermatitis usually occurs 3 to 6 weeks after primary infestation as a type IV hypersensitivity reaction created by the mite, its eggs, or its excrement, termed scybala . 32,33 Clinical {ndings vary according to the immune status of  the  host.  Immunocompetent  patients  suffer  from  extreme pruritus,  often  worse  at  nighttime.  Close  inspection  reveals erythematous  papules or  nodules,  with  super{cial  crusting  and excoriation, and there is a predilection for involvement of genital, intertriginous,  and  acral  skin. When present,  a  thin  red-brown burrow may be pathognomonic for scabies.
In  immunosuppressed  hosts,  the  in{rm,  or  institutionalized patients, a functionally debilitating pruritic dermatosis can occur. There is a speci{c association of severe scabies and infection with human T-lymphotropic virus I (HTLV-I). In these severe cases, patients present with disseminated eczematous dermatitis, nodules, and  occasionally  generalized  urticaria. 1,34 Late  {ndings  include hyperpigmentation, licheni{cation, and psoriatic-like lesions.

PRURITUS AND PAPULES
Norwegian, or crusted, scabies may occur in any case where the host is immunocompromised. It presents as diffuse involvement that may progress to wartlike lesions. In the elderly, lesions may appear  bullous,  often  mimicking  bullous  pemphigoid.  In  the newborn, lesions may be vesicular, and the disease may present as failure to thrive. Pustular diseases of the newborn, including acropustulosis  and  neonatal  acne,  may  be  considered,  but  the disseminated nature of disease, examination of the vesicular |uid, and a diagnostic  examination of a scraping after  application  of mineral oil to identify mites or their products can quickly aid in making the correct diagnosis. T opical treatments for limited disease include permethrin 5% cream, lindane, crotamiton 10% cream, sulfur, malathion, and ivermectin lotion. Crusted, nodular, or disease in the immunosuppressed often requires systemic ivermectin at topical 5% permethrin applied daily for 7 days, then twice weekly until cure. 35-37 The entire family, including pets, should be treated, and  clothes,  bedding,  and  frequently  used  fomites  should  be immediately washed in warm water. A second treatment a week after is usually recommended. Oral antihistamines or a corticosteroid taper may be required to control pruritus.
Prurigo nodularis manifests as hyperkeratotic nodules, linear excoriations, and licheni{cation, particularly over areas that the patient can reach. In this condition, patients may experience diffuse or focal pruritus. Rather than scratching, patients tend to 'pick,' creating 'picker nodules.' Therapy is with topical or injectable steroids  or  phototherapy.  Nodules  may  also  raise  concern  for scabies,  particularly  in  the  patient  with  severe  pruritus.  It  is important to consider the diagnosis of papular eruption of HIV, where patients develop erythematous papules with urticarial-type erythema.

In patients who have severe pruritus and minimal primary skin manifestations, it is important to evaluate for underlying causes, as  the  differential  is  broad,  including  dermatologic,  systemic, neurologic, and psychogenic etiologies. The differential potentially includes diseases with signi{cant morbidity, such as obstructive liver disease, chronic hepatitis, uremia, hypo- and hyperthyroidism, hematopoietic diseases, polycythemia vera, lymphoma, leukemia, myeloma,  internal  malignancies,  intestinal  parasites,  carcinoid, multiple sclerosis, AIDS, medications, and neuropsychiatric diseases, especially anorexia nervosa. 38 In a patient presenting with idiopathic pruritus, a thorough physical examination is warranted, along with the  following  laboratory  tests:  complete  blood  count  with  differential, thyroid-stimulating hormone, liver function tests, renal panel, hepatitis serologies, HIV antibody, urinalysis, stool guaiac, chest x-ray, stool for ova and parasites, and possibly serum protein electrophoresis. 1,29,34

HYPOPIGMENTATION
Hypopigmentation refers  to  any  disease,  congenital  or  acquired, that results in decreased or absent skin pigmentation. Vitiligo is a common autoimmune disease in the tropics. Caused by selective melanocyte destruction, patients present with depigmented patches that  can  involve  all  cutaneous  surfaces  and  hair. 39 Wood's  light examination may be useful in distinguishing complete depigmentation from hypopigmented skin. 40 In vitiligo, lesions appear bright white and well demarcated under Wood's lamp.
Seborrheic  dermatitis,  pityriasis  alba,  early  tinea  infections, secondary syphilis, leprosy, and hypopigmented mycosis fungoides may all cause cutaneous hypo-pigmentation. 41 It is important to highlight that hypo-pigmentation can also be seen in the so-called 'trichrome' vitiligo, where a transition from normal skin to hypopigmented and then depigmented skin is noted.

MORBILLIFORM EXANTHEMS
Individuals with measles develop a morbilliform exanthem, usually in  the  setting  of  fever  and  coryza.  For  this  discussion,  such  an exanthem describes erythematous, blanchable macules, patches, papules, and occasionally even plaques on a hyperemic background. The rash classically begins on the face and spreads cephalocaudally, sparing the palms and soles. Koplik's spots precede the rash by 1 to 2 days and are almost pathognomonic, manifesting in the mouth as white papules with surrounding erythema of a sand grain-like texture. 8 Clinical symptoms such as fever, malaise, and coryza are often present. Cases may be dif{cult to correctly diagnose in those who have previously been vaccinated and present with atypical measles. 8
Human monocytotropic ehrlichioses (HME) caused by Ehrlichia chaffeensis and human granulocytotropic anaplasmosis (HGA) caused by Anaplasma phagocytophilium and E. ewingii lead to non-speci{c symptoms such as fever, chills, headaches, and leukopenia. 42,43 The cutaneous manifestations often occur after other systemic symptoms arise. T rench fever caused by B. quintana and transmitted by the human body louse gives rise to a non-speci{c morbilliform eruption of the trunk, along with systemic symptoms. 44,45
Chikungunya, caused by the chikunguya virus transmitted by the Aedes mosquito, leads to a morbilliform eruption and often mucocutaneous lesions. It is  frequently  accompanied by a high fever and a persistent, severe joint pain that lasts post-infection.
Zika virus is transmitted by the Aedes mosquito, as well as by sexual contact. Although most patients are asymptomatic, some will develop fever, joint pains-particularly of the small joints of the hands and feet-conjunctivitis, and a morbilliform eruption.

PAPULOSQUAMOUS AND ECZEMATOID LESIONS
Papulosquamous lesions are rashes that are both raised and have scale, such as psoriasis and tinea corporis (T able 8.1). In tineas, the dermatophytes Microsporum, Trichophyton, and Epidermophyton infect keratinized tissue. Characteristically, they appear as erythematous,  annular  plaques,  with  serpiginous  borders,  with scale at the leading edge, and are named based on the location of involvement: tinea capitis (scalp), tinea corporis (body), tinea faciei (face), tinea cruris (groin), tinea pedis (feet), tinea manuum (hand), tinea barbae (beard), and tinea unguium (nails). Diagnosis can be con{rmed by performing a scraping of the scale and applying one or two drops of potassium hydroxide (KOH) and visualizing the hyphal  structures  under  10 × magni{cation.  The  differential diagnosis includes other papulosquamous or scaly raised lesions (see T able 8.1). For limited disease, topical antifungals are usually effective, except for tinea capitis and onychomycosis, which often require oral antifungal medications. Recurrence is common, and multiple courses of therapy are often required.
Non-dermatophyte super{cial mycosis includes tinea versicolor, a chronic, mildly pruritic, scaly, oval-shaped discoloration of the upper trunk, arms, and neck caused by Malassezia spp . On KOH scraping, a characteristic 'spaghetti and meatball' pattern is seen microscopically,  corresponding  to  the  short,  thick  hyphae  and spores. Even after treatment and cure, the hypopigmentation may persist for months.

Tinea nigra caused by Hortaea weneckii or Stenella araguata is found primarily in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, and Latin America. Clinically it causes a solitary, asymptomatic, light brown macule, often on the palm, that darkens and grows. Though confused with melanoma, this lesion will scrape off and can be con{rmed with KOH staining.  T opical  azoles  or  keratolytics  may  be  used  for treatment.

Black piedra caused by the astromycete Piedraia hortae is found primarily in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. It causes black, hard, {xed nodules attached to the hair. White piedra is most commonly caused  by Trichosporon  beigelii and  manifests  as  yellow  or  beige soft  sheaths  coating  hair  shafts. T reatment  for  black  and white piedra consists of a short haircut, although antifungals can also be used.
Candida is a commensal inhabitant of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary  tract,  but  is  also  a  pathogen  that  grows  during conditions  of  warmth,  moisture,  and  increased pH. Thrush,  or oral candidiasis, manifests as grayish-white plaques in the mouth that scrape off. Perlèche (angular cheilitis) is candidal-associated erythematous scaling at the angles of the oral commissure that can mimic some nutritional de{ciencies. Candidiasis often affects the perianal region, inguinal folds, and infra-mammary areas and manifests as beefy red erythema with satellite lesions and occasional pustules. Antibiotics and immunosuppression predispose to candidiasis.

PAPULOSQUAMOUS AND ECZEMATOID LESIONS
M. leprae usually affects skin on the extremities that is cooler in temperature while sparing warmer areas of the body including the axilla and scalp. There  is  a  wide  range  of  disease from  the limited tuberculoid type to the diffuse lepromatous type of leprosy (Hansen's disease). In tuberculoid leprosy, there are well-demarcated, solitary,  hypopigmented  plaques  with  raised  borders  and  slight scale.  The  hypoesthesia,  absence  of  hair,  and  lack  of  sweating within the lesions are characteristic. In lepromatous leprosy, due to  an  absence  of  cell-mediated  immunity,  there  are  numerous small, hypopigmented or erythematous macules that are ill de{ned. Loss of the lateral eyebrow, leonine facies, madarosis, glove-andstocking  neuropathy,  claw-{nger,  and  toe  deformities  are  late manifestations. Borderline lesions exist between the continuum of tuberculoid and lepromatous leprosy. 1,29,34
Lyme disease is caused by Borrelia spp . transmitted by Ixodes deer ticks. Erythema chronicum migrans (ECM) manifests as a bull' s eye lesion of a gradually expanding, non-scaly redness around the initial tick bite. Headache, stiff neck, myalgias, and arthralgias may accompany the characteristic rash.

PAPULOSQUAMOUS AND ECZEMATOID LESIONS
Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum can be divided into three main stages. During primary syphilis a painless, round, indurated chancre forms, which may develop on extragenital sites such as within the oral cavity in addition to the genitalia. Secondary syphilis may manifest as a non-speci{c maculopapular, or less commonly a  papulosquamous eruption, classically with involvement of the palms and soles (Fig. 8.5). T ertiary, late-stage syphilis may manifest as  nodulo-ulcerative  lesions  consisting  of  reddish-brown,  {rm nodules.  In  congenital  syphilis,  infants  are  often  born  without signs  of  disease  but  can  later  develop  a  saddle  nose  deformity, failure to thrive, notched and peg-shaped teeth called Hutchinson's teeth, clouding of the cornea, and scarring of the skin around the mouth and genitals.
HTLV-I infection may be associated with several dermatologic conditions.  Patients  may  present  with  recalcitrant  eczematoid dermatitis,  seborrheic dermatitis, and  blepharitis. In adults, dermatologic disease may be a presenting manifestation of adult T-cell leukemia. Affected patients present with disseminated papules that coalesce into plaques and nodules, with striking in{ltrative morphology.  The  disease  is  often  fatal,  but  smoldering  forms, chronic  disease,  and  lymphoma-type  disease  have  also  been reported.

ERYTHRODERMA
Correctly diagnosing the cause of diffuse erythroderma or wholebody erythema presents a unique challenge to the physician. These patients  may  present  with  marked  systemic  symptoms  and  can suffer severe morbidity from a lack of epidermal barrier function, including  dehydration,  infection,  and  severe  pain. 1,34 Ectropion may be seen. Diffuse erythema can lead to severe imbalances of

electrolytes and minerals, and hypocalcemic tetany can occur. Skin exfoliation can also result in severe protein losses. 46 As the eruption improves, generalized exfoliation is the norm. The evaluation of patients with erythroderma often requires histopathologic evaluation to  exclude  full-thickness  epidermal  necrosis,  including  toxic epidermal  necrolysis  (TEN). 47 TEN is  commonly  caused  by  a drug, but infectious etiologies have also been implicated, particularly mycoplasma and herpetic infections. 48

ERYTHRODERMA
The  presence  of  small,  super{cial  pustules  may  indicate exanthematous  generalized  pustular  dermatosis  (AGEP),  most commonly caused by beta-lactam and cephalosporin antibiotics (Fig. 8.6). 49 Patients present with fever and can have peripheral blood leukocytosis, commonly prompting evaluation for an infectious disease. A similar {nding may be noted in pustular psoriasis that may occur in patients with no prior history of psoriasis. Though nail  {ndings  may  be  helpful  in  those  with  prior  history,  such {ndings  may  not  be  seen  in  those  with  an  acute  {rst  episode. Patients  appear  ill  and  are  often  hospitalized.  Cultures  of  the pustules fail to indicate a super{cial cutaneous infection, though ectopic infection such as streptococcal pharyngitis may precipitate an  attack. 50 Cyclosporine  is  the  treatment  of  choice  for  acute erythrodermic  psoriasis  |ares  because  of  its  ef{cacy  and  rapid onset of action. 51
Pityriasis rubra pilaris,  a close relative of psoriasis,  may also be the cause of erythroderma. 52 Patients often have conspicuous 'islands of sparing,' where seemingly normal skin is noted among erythrodermic  skin  (Fig.  8.7). 53 Hyperlinearity  may  be  seen  in palms and soles, in addition to a salmon-colored, sand-papered type of scale with sharp demarcation along transgredient lines.
Other important diagnoses to consider include atopic dermatitis, viral exanthems, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, which in the leukemic phase  is  termed Sezary's  syndrome,  Staphylococcus skin  scalded syndrome, and toxic shock syndrome. In HIV-positive individuals or  those  with  other  immunosuppressing  disorders,  seborrheic dermatitis  may  lead  to  erythroderma. 34 Uncommonly, systemic malignancies such as colon and lung carcinoma, as well as lymphoma and leukemia, can also be culprits. In those who have had a bone marrow transplant, erythroderma may be a result of graft-versushost disease (GVHD).

ICTHYOSIS
Fishlike scaling on cutaneous surfaces (icthyosis) may be seen in a variety of conditions, both congenital and acquired. Disease may range  from  limited  and  asymptomatic  to  disseminated  and  life threatening. The most commonly inherited ichthyosis, icthyosis vulgaris, is inherited in an autosomal semi-dominant fashion with incomplete  penetrance.  It  develops  as  scaling  over  relatively
unin|amed skin. 29,54 Usually, antecubital fossae are spared. Scales may become hyperpigmented and feel tightly adherent to underlying skin. It may be coincident with atopic dermatitis or its associated {ndings, such as the follicularly based, spiny, hyperkeratotic papules of keratosis pilaris over the upper extremities and thighs. 55  Though icthyosis may be the presenting sign of a lymphoma, most commonly  it  is  found  in  the  general  population  and  may  go unnoticed.

SERPIGINOUS LESIONS
Cutaneous larva migrans is caused by zoonotic hookworms. Referred to as the 'creeping eruption,' the primary lesion is a serpiginous, slightly swollen, erythematous lesion that may induce local urticaria. Infection  is  acquired  cutaneously,  most  often  from  dog  or  cat hookworms ( Ancylostoma braziliense ). Interestingly, the advancing edge of the lesion does not accurately represent the body of the hookworm,  but  rather  the  in|ammatory  reaction  that  trails  it. Usually, the hookworm has advanced beyond the visible serpiginous border,  so  destructive  therapies  such  as  cryotherapy  applied  to the advancing edge often miss the hookworm altogether. If such treatments are performed, therapy should aim about 1 cm ahead of the advancing edge. Notably, the hookworms causing cutaneous larva migrans lack collagenase and are therefore restricted to the squamous epithelium  in  skin  and  are  only  rarely  found  in  the dermis due to the presence of collagen type IV in the basement membrane separating dermis from epidermis. 29

EDEMA
Lymphatic {lariasis is associated with lymphangitis and recurrent and worsening episodes of lymphedema. 5 Lymphedema is due to impedance  in  lymphatic  |ow  or  outright  lymphatic  channel destruction. Licheni{cation, {ssuring, and scaling can be seen in long-standing infections. End-stage disease can be mistaken for elephantiasis verrucosa nostra from chronic stasis dermatitis, as well as podoconiosis, with the latter caused by lymphatic obstruction secondary to silica-laden volcanic ash. Unilateral chronic extremity edema should  prompt consideration of  {lariasis  or  a  unilateral obstructing mass in the draining lymph nodes. Other important clues  to  the  diagnosis  of  lymphatic  {lariasis  include  testicular hydrocele and lymphadenopathy.

EDEMA
Loiasis is a {larial infection in which the adult Loa loa worm migrates in subcutaneous tissue and across the conjunctiva ('eye worm').  Localized  edema  from  a  hypersensitivity  reaction  can occur  over  joints  and  bony  prominences  as  the  worm  passes, so-called Calabar swellings. 5 Peripheral eosinophilia is prominent. Compared with lymphatic {lariasis, loaiasis-associated edema is transient and migratory. Onchocerca volvulus, the causative organism of onchocerciasis (river blindness), is another {larial infection that often {rst manifests  in the skin.  Micro{lariae  are  produced  by adult  worms  that  reside  in  subcutaneous  nodules,  so-called onchocermata . Micro{lariae migrate freely through subcutaneous and  ocular  structures.  Dying  micro{lariae  provoke  an  intense in|ammatory response, leading to pruritus and excoriations, and a diffuse papular dermatitis. Papules and plaques can be seen with overlying  licheni{ed  streaks  indicating  chronic  scratching  and rubbing  by  af|icted  patients.  Scabetic  infection  may  enter  the differential diagnosis, but linear burrows along inter-digital web spaces,  genital  involvement, and evidence of the causative mite on a mineral oil preparation can usually readily diagnose the latter hyper-pigmentation, commonly referred to as leopard skin, would point to the diagnosis of chronic onchocerciasis. Loss of elasticity of skin can lead to 'hanging groin.'
Trichinosis can also be the cause of edema, though in this case, periorbital, non-dependent edema is most commonly noted. Other dermatologic {ndings may include a hypersensitivity-like petechial
