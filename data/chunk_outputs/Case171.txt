Key features
- Rare disease caused by achlorophyllic algae of the genus Prototheca
- Infection via direct contact with organism in environment, often associated with trauma
- Three clinical pathologic syndromes:
- localized olecranon granulomatous bursitis in immunocompetent individuals
- eczematoid dermatitis and soft tissue infection in immunosuppressed individuals
- life-threatening disseminated infections in severely immunosuppressed patients
- Skin scrapings, culture and biopsy used for diagnosis
- Surgical resection adequate for olecranon bursitis
- Amphotericin B and azole antifungals have some e#ect but the organism responds poorly to most local and systemic therapy

INTRODUCTION
Protothecosis  is  a  rare  human  infection  caused  by  achlorophyllic algae belonging to the genus Prototheca [1, 2]. Infections have involved skin, subcutaneous tissue, olecranon bursa and, rarely, lymph nodes or deep organs [3, 4]. Slightly more than 100 cases have been reported in the world literature from temperate and tropical areas of all continents, with no clear geographic distribution [2]. As a veterinary infection,  such  as  bovine  mastitis,  becomes  more  frequent,  prothecosis takes on greater economic and public health importance.

EPIDEMIOLOGY, NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
The index case of protothecosis in humans (Fig. 79.1) was caused by Prototheca  zopfii [3].  With  a  few  exceptions,  all  other  infections  in humans where the species was determined have been caused by Prototheca wickerhamii [2, 4] . Prototheca wickerhamii and P. zopfii are ubiquitous achloric algae usually found in soil and contaminated water. Both are spherical unicellular organisms, 3-30 μ m in diameter with hyaline sporangia and asexual reproduction by internal septation and cytoplasmic cleavage. Prototheca are thought to be mutant strains of chlorophyllic  (green)  algae. Prototheca  wickerhamii divides  to  form characteristic morulas (Fig. 79.2), a form described rarely in P. zopfii . Infections  by  both  organisms  have  been  reported  in  a  variety  of

animals.  Animal pathogens, Prototheca  stagnora ,  and Prototheca  blaschkeae , are not known to cause disease in humans [2].
Chlorella is  similar to Prototheca and must be differentiated in tissue sections.  Both Prototheca and Chlorella are  distinct  from  fungi  and bacteria by size, morphology, and type of reproduction. In addition, Prototheca and Chlorella lack the glucosamine of the fungal cell wall and the muramic acid of bacteria [2]. Although infections by Chlorella have been described in several animals, there is only one published report involving a human [4].
Very little is known about the pathogenesis of protothecosis. Recent evidence suggests that neutrophil and natural killer cell dysfunction increases susceptibility.

CLINICAL FEATURES
There are two clinical syndromes associated with Prototheca infection: a localized infection of the olecranon bursa in patients with normal immunity  and  an  eczematoid  dermatitis/soft  tissue  infection  in immunosuppressed  individuals  [4,  5].  Some  infections  have  been associated  with  trauma  and/or  contact  with  contaminated  water; others are iatrogenic from contaminated catheters, peritoneal dialysis or  following  orthopedic  procedures.  A  third  clinical  syndrome, involvement  of  internal  organs  or  systemic  infection,  has  been reported in several patients with severe immune suppression (AIDS, chemotherapy, and post-transplantation) [6-8].
Protothecosis  of  the  olecranon  bursa  develops  several  weeks  after injury to the elbow. The lesions are localized to the bursa, but there may be epithelial hyperplasia and underlying sinus tracts. The bursa is  thickened and histopathologic changes include areas of caseation necrosis  surrounded  by epithelioid  cells, Langhan's  giant cells, and fibrosis. Prototheca organisms  are  scattered  throughout  the  areas  of necrosis and in the wall of the granuloma.
In the cutaneous and subcutaneous forms, there are single or multiple lesions on the skin or within the subcutaneous tissue, usually over an exposed portion of the body, such as a limb or the face. The lesions are papulomacular to plaque-like and may have an overlying crust or focal ulceration; they spread slowly, often in a centrifugal pattern, and do not resolve. The inflammatory response varies from minimal to necrotizing granulomatous reaction and appears related to the depth of the invasion. The organisms may be in any or all layers of the skin and may be single or in clusters, extracellular or within giant cells. These lesions must be differentiated from other chronic granulomatous diseases of the skin and soft tissue. In the few reported cases of systemic infection, affected tissue showed fibrosis and eosinophilia.

PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Scrapings of the skin, biopsy specimens, and aspirates can be cultured on Sabouraud's medium and require 1-2 days for growth [2]. Typical sporulating forms are identified on stained wet-mounts. Although the

organisms are usually apparent with routine staining by hematoxylineosin, they are much better seen with fungal stains, such as Gomori methenamine-silver,  periodic  acid-Schiff,  and  Gridley  fungus. Prototheca species are distinguished from Cryptococcus , Coccidioides , Blastomyces , and other fungi by the type of division. Sugar assimilation tests and fluorescent immunoassay aid in species determination.

TREATMENT
Simple bursectomy cures protothecosis of the olecranon bursa. The cutaneous  lesions  in  immunosuppressed  patients  resist  treatment and  may  persist  for  several  years,  eventually  spreading  to  other sites  [2].  Topical  treatments,  including  Castellani's  paint,  saturated copper  sulfate,  potassium  permanganate  and  amphotericin  B,  as well  as  systemic  griseofulvin,  penicillin,  emetine  hydrochloride, 5-fluorouricil, and pentamidine isothionate, have not been effective. In vitro studies have demonstrated sensitivity to amphotericin B, tetracycline, gentamicin, and ketoconazole [2]. Combined therapy with tetracycline and amphotericin B may be effective. Isolated cutaneous, bursal and soft tissue lesions are best treated with local excision and ketoconazole.  Infections  that  are  multifocal,  visceral  or  occur  in immunocompromised  hosts  require  amphotericin-B  or  combined therapy.
