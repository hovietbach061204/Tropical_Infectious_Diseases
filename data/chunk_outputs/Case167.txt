Key features
- Leptospirosis is a neglected, emerging zoonosis that causes substantial morbidity and mortality in impoverished regions of the tropics
- Weil's disease is the name given to classic severe leptospirosis and is characterized by jaundice, renal failure and a high mortality rate
- Leptospirosis-associated pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome (LPHS) is a more recently recognized severe disease manifestation causing massive bleeding into the lungs and a poor clinical outcome
- The pathogenesis of leptospirosis remains largely unexplained and the key pathologic feature is a paucity of histopathologic changes in organs with marked functional impairment
- Diagnostic con)rmation is rarely available in areas where most disease transmission occurs
- Individuals with leptospirosis should receive antimicrobial therapy, often oral doxycycline or intravenous penicillin, although other agents may also be e(ective
- There is no commercially available vaccine for use in humans to prevent leptospirosis, although prophylactic weekly doxycycline can be used to prevent disease among select at-risk populations and during outbreaks

INTRODUCTION
Leptospirosis is a worldwide zoonosis transmitted by pathogenic spirochetes  of  the  genus Leptospira .  The  pathogenesis  remains  largely unexplained  even  though  Weil  published  a  clinical  description  of leptospirosis in 1886. In 1916, Inada isolated leptospires, identified them as the etiologic agent and linked rats to disease transmission [1]. The disease is of greatest public health importance in the tropics, where it is an endemic disease of rice farmers and residents of urban slums  [2].  Substantial  recent  outbreaks  superimposed  on  endemic disease  activity  were  linked  to  the  introduction  of  a  new  clone  of Leptospira in Thailand [3] and followed severe flooding caused by two typhoons in the Philippines [4].

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Leptospirosis  is  caused  by  spirochetes  of  the  genus Leptospira .  This genus  contains  at  least  18  species  classified  on  the  basis  of  DNA relatedness  and  more  than  300  serovars  (serovarieties)  based  on agglutinating antigens. Leptospires nest in the renal tubules of mammalian hosts and are shed in the urine. They can survive for several

months in the environment under moist conditions, particularly in the presence of warmth (above 22°C) and a neutral pH (pH 6.2-8.0). These conditions occur all year round in the tropics, but only during the summer and autumn months in temperate climates. Roughly 160 animal species harbor organisms, but rodents are the most important reservoir. Carrier rates of over 50% have been measured in Norway rats,  which  shed  massive  numbers  of  organisms  for  life,  without showing  clinical  illness.  Some  serovars  appear  to  be  preferentially adapted to select mammalian hosts. For example, the serovar icterohaemorrhagiae is primarily associated with the Norway rat, canicola with dogs and pomona with swine and cattle. However, a particular host species may serve as a reservoir for one or more serovars and a particular serovar may be hosted by many different animal species.
The transmission of infection from animal to human usually occurs through contact with contaminated water or moist soil. Organisms enter humans through abrasions of the skin or through the mucosal surface of the eye, mouth, nasopharynx, or esophagus. Crowded cities that  are  flood-prone  and  have  large  rat  populations  provide  ideal conditions for disease transmission. Escalating migration of the rural poor to urban slums is likely to further exacerbate the risks of leptospirosis transmission [2, 5]. An outbreak in Nicaragua in 1995 and an urban epidemic in Salvador, Brazil in 1999 were associated with particularly heavy rains and flooding. In 2009, two typhoons struck the Philippines and caused massive flooding. Leptospirosis was recognized as the most urgent threat to health in the aftermath of the typhoons [4]. Special clinics to treat the disease were set up in evacuation centers and an estimated 1.3 million flood survivors were given chemoprophylaxis.
Intense exposure to leptospires has been documented in rice, sugar cane, and rubber plantation workers. Less frequently, leptospirosis is acquired by direct contact with the blood, urine, or tissues of infected animals. Epidemiologic patterns in the USA and UK have changed. Recreational  exposure  to  freshwater  (e.g.  canoeing,  sailing,  water skiing) and animal contact at home have replaced occupational exposure as the chief sources of disease in industrialized areas.

Measuring incidence by active surveillance confirms that leptospirosis is  a  surprisingly common disease. Antibody positivity rates of 37% have been recorded in rural Belize and 23% in Vietnam. More than 2527 human cases and 13 deaths were reported for the first 9 months of 1999 by the Ministry of Public Health in Thailand. Human leptospirosis is an important disease in China, Southeast Asia, India, Africa, and South and Central America. It is also of significance in eastern and southern Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. In the USA, the disease  is  primarily  of  veterinary  importance,  with  only  50-150 human cases reported annually.

============================================================
NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
Infection  may  be  asymptomatic,  but  5-15%  of  cases  are  severe or fatal. Pathogenesis, particularly that of severe disease, remains poorly understood. Overall, renal failure is the most common cause of death in  leptospirosis.  Leptospires  are  frequently  found  in  human  renal
tissue, but their role in mediating kidney damage is unknown. Interstitial nephritis is primarily found in individuals who have survived until  inflammation  has  had  an  opportunity  to develop,  but is  frequently  absent  in  patients  with  fulminant  disease.  Impaired  renal perfusion constitutes the fundamental nephropathic change. In some geographic  areas,  pulmonary  hemorrhage  is  the  principal  cause  of death and is associated with the linear deposition of immunoglobulins  and complement on the alveolar surface [6]. It is unclear why renal failure predominates as the principal cause  of death in some places,  while  pulmonary  hemorrhage is  the  major cause  in others, even where the most common infecting serovars are the same. There are only minor histopathologic changes in the kidneys and livers of patients with marked functional impairment of these organs. Patients who survive severe leptospirosis  have complete recovery of  hepatic and renal function - consistent with the lack of structural damage to these organs.

CLINICAL FEATURES
The most common clinical features of leptospirosis are summarized in Table 74-1.
Subclinical infection is common and less than 10% of symptomatic infections result in severe, icteric illness. Even relatively virulent serovars, such as icterohaemorrhagiae lead more often to anicteric than to icteric disease. Old terms such as peapicker's disease, swineherd's disease  and  canicola  fever,  which  linked  specific  serotypes  with distinct disease manifestations, are misleading  and should be

abandoned. The median incubation period is 10 days, with a range of 2-26 days. The duration of the incubation period has no prognostic significance. Once symptoms develop, they may follow a biphasic course: after an initial febrile illness there is defervescence of fever and symptomatic improvement followed by a second period of disease. However, a clear demarcation between the first and second stages is atypical of icteric leptospirosis and, in mild cases, the distinction can be unclear or the second stage may never occur. The diagnostic usefulness of a history of a biphasic illness has been overemphasized. HIV co-infection does not seem to affect the clinical presentation of leptospirosis in the few co-infected patients described thus far.

============================================================
Symptoms and Signs
Typically, the disease begins with the abrupt onset of intense headache, fever, chills, and myalgia. Fever often exceeds 40°C (103°F) and is preceded by rigors. Muscle pain can be excruciating and occurs most commonly in the thighs, calves, lumbosacral region, and abdomen. Abdominal  wall  pain  accompanied  by  palpation  tenderness  can mimic an acute surgical abdomen. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and sore throat are other frequent symptoms. Cough and chest pain figure prominently in reports of patients from Korea and China.
Conjunctival suffusion is a helpful diagnostic clue that usually appears two  or  three  days  after  the  onset  of  fever  and  involves  the  bulbar conjunctiva.  Pus  and  serous  secretions  are  absent  and  there  is  no matting  of  the  eyelashes  and  eyelids.  Mild  suffusion  can  easily  be overlooked. Less common and less distinctive signs include pharyngeal injection, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and skin  lesions.  Within  a  week,  most  patients  become  asymptomatic. After several days of apparent recovery, the illness resumes in some individuals. Manifestations of the second stage are more variable and mild than those of the initial illness and usually last 2-4 days. Leptospires  disappear  from  the  blood,  cerebrospinal  fluid  (CSF),  and tissues, but appear in the urine. Serum antibody titers rise - hence the term  'immune'  phase.  Meningitis  is  the  hallmark  of  this  stage  of leptospirosis. Pleocytosis of the CSF can be demonstrated in 80-90% of all patients during the second week of illness, although only about 50% will have clinical signs and symptoms of meningitis. Meningeal signs can last several weeks, but usually resolve within a day or two. Uveitis  is  a  late  manifestation  of  leptospirosis,  generally  seen  4-8 months after the illness has begun. The anterior uveal tract is most frequently affected and pain, photophobia, and blurring of vision are the usual symptoms.

Laboratory Findings
White  blood  cell  count  varies,  but  neutrophilia  is  usually  present. Urinalysis may show proteinuria, pyuria, and microscopic hematuria. Enzyme markers of skeletal muscle damage, such as creatinine kinase and aldolase are elevated in the sera of 50% of patients during the first week of illness. Chest radiographs from patients with pulmonary manifestations show a variety of abnormalities, but none is pathognomonic  of  leptospirosis.  The  most  common  finding  is  small, patchy, snowflake-like lesions in the periphery of the lung fields.

ICTERIC LEPTOSPIROSIS (WEIL'S DISEASE)
Weil's  disease  refers  to  severe,  life-threatening  leptospirosis  and  is characterized by jaundice, renal dysfunction, hemorrhagic manifestations, and a high mortality rate. Although jaundice is the hallmark of severe leptospirosis, fatalities do not occur because of liver failure. The degree of jaundice has no prognostic significance, but its presence or absence  does  -  virtually  all  leptospirosis  deaths  occur  in  icteric patients.  Icterus  first  appears  between  the  fifth  and  ninth  days  of illness, reaches maximum intensity 4 or 5 days later and continues for an average of 1 month. Hepatomegaly is found in the majority of patients; hepatic percussion tenderness is a reliable clinical marker of continuing disease activity. There is no residual liver dysfunction in survivors of Weil's disease, consistent with the absence of structural damage seen on pathologic examination.
FIGURE 74.1 Jaundice, hemorrhage, and conjunctival suHusion in acute leptospirosis.
Bleeding is occasionally seen in anicteric cases but is most prevalent in severe disease. Purpura, petechiae, epistaxis, bleeding of the gums, and minor hemoptysis are the most common hemorrhagic manifestations;  however,  deaths  occur  from  subarachnoid  hemorrhage  and exsanguination from gastrointestinal bleeding. Conjunctival hemorrhage is an extremely useful diagnostic finding and, when combined with scleral icterus and conjunctival suffusion, produces eye findings strongly suggestive of leptospirosis (see Fig. 74.1). The frequency with which  severe  pulmonary  hemorrhage  complicates  leptospirosis  is variable but is a cardinal feature of some outbreaks.

ICTERIC LEPTOSPIROSIS (WEIL'S DISEASE)
Life-threatening  renal  failure  is  a  complication  of  icteric  disease, although  all  forms  of  leptospirosis  may  be  associated  with  mild kidney  dysfunction.  Oliguria  or  anuria  usually  develop  during  the second week of illness, but may appear earlier. Complete anuria is a grave prognostic sign often seen in patients who present late in the course of illness with frank uremia and irreversible disease. Because renal  failure  develops  very  quickly  in  leptospirosis,  symptoms  and signs  of  uremia  are  frequently  encountered.  Anorexia,  vomiting, drowsiness, disorientation, and confusion are seen early and rapidly progress  to  convulsions,  stupor,  and  coma  in  severe  cases.  Disturbances  of  consciousness  in  a  patient  with  severe  leptospirosis  are usually caused by uremic encephalopathy, whereas in anicteric cases aseptic  encephalitis  is  the  usual  cause.  Renal  function  eventually returns to normal in survivors of Weil's disease, although detectable abnormalities may persist for several months.
Leptospirosis-associated  severe  pulmonary  hemorrhage  syndrome (SPHS) is  now  recognized  as  a  widespread  public  health  problem with a case fatality  rate  of  about  50%.  This  lethal  complication  of leptospirosis  can  occur  either  with  or  without  jaundice  and  renal failure.  Hemoptysis  is  the  cardinal  sign  but  may  not  be  apparent until  patients  are  intubated.  Real-time  PCR  has  shown  that  leptospiremia is 10,000 or more bacteria per milliliter of blood in SPHS - the apparent critical threshold for severe outcomes such as SPHS and death [6].

Laboratory Features of Weil's Disease
Hyperbilirubinemia results from increases in both conjugated (direct) and  unconjugated  (indirect)  bilirubin,  but  elevations  of  the  direct fraction predominate. Prolongations of the prothrombin time commonly occur but are easily corrected by the administration of vitamin K; modest elevations of serum alkaline phosphatase are typical. There is  mild  hepatocellular  necrosis;  greater  than  fivefold  increases  of transaminase  (aminotransferase)  levels  are  exceptional.  Jaundiced patients usually have leukocytosis in the range of 15,000 to 30,000 per mm 3 and neutrophilia is constant. Anemia is common and multifactorial;  blood  loss  and  renal  dysfunction  contribute  frequently, intravascular  hemolysis  less  often.  Mild  thrombocytopenia  often occurs but decreases in platelet count sufficient to be associated with bleeding  are  exceptional.  The  specific  gravity  of  the  urine  is  high. Hypokalemia due to renal potassium wasting can occur and hypomagnesemia has been reported.

PATIENT EVALUATION
Patients who present with an undifferentiated febrile illness must be carefully  evaluated  for  possible  leptospirosis.  A  history  of  water  or animal contact is particularly helpful. Key symptoms and signs are conjunctival  suffusion  and  severe  myalgia  with  tenderness.  In  the context  of  a  known  outbreak  of  leptospirosis,  individuals  must  be carefully assessed for signs of severe disease. The most important signs of severity are jaundice, bleeding, pulmonary involvement, oliguria, and a raised serum creatinine level.

============================================================
CHUNK 15
============================================================
DIAGNOSIS
Most cases go undiagnosed because symptoms and signs are often nonspecific and serologic confirmation is rarely available where most disease transmission occurs. Failure to diagnose leptospirosis is particularly  unfortunate:  severely  ill  patients  often  recover  completely with  prompt  treatment  but  delayed  therapy  is  likely  to  result  in  a poor  clinical  outcome.  Late  disease  can  often  be  recognized  by  its typical  clinical  manifestations,  but  the  presentation  of  early  leptospirosis  is usually nonspecific and is therefore difficult  to identify clinically. Leptospirosis has long been acknowledged to be a frequent cause  of  undifferentiated  febrile  illness  in  developing  countries. Co-infection  with  diseases  such  as  malaria  and  scrub  typhus  has been  reported  and  adds  to  the  diagnostic  confusion  of  tropical fevers.
Laboratory  diagnosis  of  leptospirosis  remains  problematic.  The microscopic agglutination test is considered the serodiagnostic method of choice for leptospirosis, but its complexity limits its use to reference laboratories. Dilutions of patient sera are applied to a panel of live, pathogenic leptospires. The results are viewed under dark-field microscopy  and  expressed  as  the  percentage  of  organisms  cleared from the field by agglutination. Inadequate quality controls of the live reference strain panels can lead to frequent false-negative results [7]. A new generation of commercially available, rapid serodiagnostic kits that rely on whole Leptospira antigen preparations have been developed.  Unfortunately,  these  assays  seem  to  have  unacceptably  low sensitivities  during acute-phase illness and persistent antibody produces low specificity in regions  of high endemic transmission. The need for practical, affordable diagnostic kits to be available in areas where leptospirosis is common cannot be overemphasized. PCR and urine antigen detection are research tools that would be of the greatest potential diagnostic value in patients who present early, before antibodies have reached detectable levels.
Isolation of leptospires from blood or CSF is possible during the first 10 days of clinical illness, but specialized media are necessary. Serially diluted urine provides the highest yield. Unfortunately, culture results are  only  known  4-6  weeks  later  -  too  late  to  benefit  severely  ill, hospitalized patients.

DIAGNOSIS
Several attempts have been made to formulate diagnostic algorithms by assigning points to various clinical, epidemiologic and laboratory parameters. The points are totaled and the score is then used to represent the likelihood that the patient in question has leptospirosis. An example is shown in Table 74-2. The usefulness of these scoring systems is limited by their complexity, by marked regional variability in the quality of available diagnostic tests and by regional differences in  the  prevalent  differential  diagnoses  that  must  be  considered. However, these scoring systems are useful teaching tools, and emphasize  the  important  epidemiologic  and  clinical  characteristics  of leptospirosis.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The  typical  leptospirosis  patient  has  a  history  of  water  or  animal contact, conjunctival suffusion and severe myalgia. It is important to solicit these findings in both mild and severe cases of leptospirosis. Atypical  or  mild  cases  are  often  confused  with  other  entities  but, because of a low index of suspicion and the disease's protean manifestations,  the  diagnosis  is  often  missed,  even  in  typical  cases.

Marked leukocytosis and a negative blood film argue against malaria. Jaundice, severe renal dysfunction, and leukocytosis are atypical of typhoid fever. Differentiating leptospirosis from scrub typhus and Korean hemorrhagic fever (caused by Hantaan virus) in areas where these diseases coexist is more difficult. Both are  associated  with  animals  and  both  can  cause  conjunctival suffusion.

TREATMENT
Placebo-controlled, double-blind trials have proven that doxycycline benefits patients with early, mild leptospirosis and that intravenous penicillin helps adults with severe, late disease [9]. The outcome of severe, pediatric leptospirosis is also improved by penicillin therapy. Antibiotics should therefore be given to all patients with leptospirosis, regardless of age or when in their disease course they are seen. Doxycycline  is  given  at  doses  of  100 mg  orally  twice  a  day  for  1  week. Patients  who  are  vomiting  or  are  seriously  ill  require  parenteral therapy.  Intravenous  penicillin  G  is  administered  to  adults  as  1.5 million units every 6 h for 1 week. Recent trials from Thailand indicate that treatment with ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and doxycycline had equivalent efficacy to penicillin in patients with mild-to-moderately severe disease. However, it is not known whether these antibiotics are as effective as high-dose penicillin for treatment of the most severely ill  individuals.  Doxycycline and azithromycin  had comparable efficacy  as  presumptive  treatment  of  mildly  ill  patients  found  later  to have leptospirosis, scrub typhus, or dual infections.
There is controversy regarding the occurrence of a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction  in  leptospirosis.  If  present,  it  is  much  less  prominent  in leptospirosis  than  in  other  spirochetal  illnesses.  The  important
practical  consideration  is  that  antibiotics  should  not  be  withheld because of the fear of a possible Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction.
The management of pulmonary hemorrhage often requires prompt intubation and mechanical ventilation. SPHS patients have physiologic and pathologic evidence for acute respiratory distress syndrome so  ventilation  using  low  tidal  volumes  and  high  post-expiratory end-pressures should be provided. Respiratory support to maintain adequate  tissue  oxygenation  is  essential  because  in  nonfatal  cases complete recovery of pulmonary function can be achieved. Ensuring adequate renal perfusion prevents renal failure in the vast majority of oliguric individuals. Continuous hemofiltration has been shown to be  more  effective  than  peritoneal  dialysis  in  treating  infectionassociated  hypercatabolic renal failure. Peritoneal  dialysis, however, may  be  the  only  option  in  resource-limited  settings.  Whichever method of dialysis is chosen, it must be started promptly - delays increase mortality.

PREVENTION
Doxycycline 200 mg taken once a week prevents infection by pathogenic leptospires. Widespread use of doxycycline prophylaxis is not indicated,  but it can  benefit  those  who  are at  high  risk for  a short time,  such  as  military  personnel  and  certain  agricultural  workers. Infection  by  leptospires  confers  only  serovar-specific  immunity; second attacks caused by different serovars can occur. The efficacy and safety of human leptospiral vaccines have yet to be conclusively demonstrated.  Prevention  of  leptospirosis  in  the  tropics  is  particularly difficult. The large animal reservoir of infection is impossible to eliminate,  the  occurrence  of  numerous  serovars limits  the  usefulness  of serovar-specific  vaccine  and  the  wearing of protective  clothing  (e.g. rubber  boots  in  rice  fields)  is  both  prohibitively  expensive  and impractical. Providing proper sanitation in urban slum communities would be the most effective control measure in this setting.
