INTRODUCTION
The importance of nontyphoid Salmonellae (NTS) as a cause of invasive  disease  in  Africa  has  overtaken  their  importance  as  a  cause  of diarrheal illness and enterocolitis. NTS have been a significant cause of invasive bacterial disease among children in the tropics, particularly in  sub-Saharan  Africa,  for  many  decades,  pre-dating  the  HIV  epidemic. In 1983, the first six cases of AIDS presenting among African adults were described, three of whom had Salmonella Typhimurium bacteremia [1, 2]. Invasive NTS (iNTS), associated with AIDS in Africa, was first described as being predominantly caused by S . typhimurium, with an absence of diarrhea and a high recurrence rate [3] now all well-recognized features of this illness. Recurrent NTS bacteremia was added to the CDC case definition of AIDS in 1987. As the HIV epidemic has evolved, iNTS disease has become one of the commonest causes of febrile adult admission in sub-Saharan Africa. iNTS in children and HIV-infected adults carries a high mortality and, even with appropriate antibiotic treatment, there is a 30-50% rate of recurrence. Empiric diagnosis and management remain challenging, and multidrug antimicrobial resistance is a rapidly developing problem.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Blood culture series of febrile adults and children in HIVendemic  Africa  have  consistently  shown  that  NTS  are  one  of  the commonest  causes  of  invasive  bacterial  infection  together  with
Streptococcus pneumoniae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (see Fig. 45.1) [4]. In sub-Saharan Africa, the incidence of iNTS far exceeds that of invasive disease caused by Salmonella Typhi [5]. Salmonella Typhimurium and Salmonella Enteritidis are the most commonly isolated serovars. In contrast, in North Africa, where HIV prevalence is lower and malaria  is  not  endemic, Salmonella Typhi  is  often  the  commonest blood  isolate  [6].  An  increase  in  iNTS  disease  coincided  with  an increase in HIV prevalence in Thailand, but iNTS remains much less common in Asia than S . Typhi and S . Paratyphi in all ages.
There are very few estimates of the burden of NTS diarrheal disease in  Africa  [7].  Most  healthy  African  children  appear  to  have  been exposed to Salmonella , presumably during early intestinal infection, and acquired killing antibodies by the age of 16 months [8]. Among African children, the rate of asymptomatic carriage in the stool may be nearly as high as the rate of detection during diarrheal disease [9], but this is not a universal finding.
iNTS occurs in a bimodal age distribution in Africa, peaking among young children, aged 6-24 months and among adults aged 20-45 years (see Fig.  45.2) [5]. Conservative estimates of the incidence of pediatric iNTS in sub-Saharan Africa range from 170-388 per 100,000 person  years  in  children  under  the  age  of  3  years;  this  drops  to

EPIDEMIOLOGY
6/100,000 over the age of 5 years [10-12]. There is a lower incidence among infants in the first 4 months of life, consistent with protection from maternal IgG or from secretory IgA in breastmilk [8], but NTS may, nonetheless, be a significant cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis [13].
In children, severe malaria and malnutrition are associated with an increased risk of invasive bacterial disease, including iNTS. Compared with other bacterial  pathogens in children, iNTS is associated with severe  anemia,  often  in  the  context  of  malaria  [14-18].  Sickle  cell anemia is strongly associated with iNTS in African children, but this is not a common risk factor. HIV infection also confers an increased risk of iNTS in African children but, in contrast to adults, most cases of iNTS in African children are not HIV-related.
In adults, there is a close association between iNTS and advanced HIV disease  in  sub-Saharan Africa,  with  over 95% of cases  occurring  in HIV-infected  individuals  [6,  19].  The  incidence  of  iNTS  in  HIVinfected  adults  ranges  from  2000-8500/100,000  person  years  of observation.  Events  are  rare  at  high  CD4  counts,  but  rise  up  to 9000/100,000 when CD4 < 200 cells/ μ l  [20].  The  impact  of  widely available anti-retroviral treatment (ART) in Africa is not yet clear.
Other conditions predisposing adults to invasive NTS disease include diabetes, long-term steroid use, hematologic or solid cancers, autoimmune  disease,  advanced  liver  disease  (particularly  alcoholic  liver disease), renal or other transplantation, and the use of other immunosuppressive drugs, including anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antibody treatment. Invasive  NTS  disease is  also  seen  in  children  with specific primary immunodeficiencies, including chronic granulomatous  disease  and  rare  genetic  deficiencies  of  cytokine  subunits  or receptors in the interleukin (IL)12/IL23 pathway [20].

============================================================
CHUNK 4
============================================================
EPIDEMIOLOGY
iNTS incidence in both adults and children is associated with seasonal rainfall (see Fig. 45.3), although it is uncertain whether this results from increased waterborne transmission, or whether it is because it coincides with the peak period for malaria and malnutrition, which are  also  risk  factors.  The  relationship  between  invasive  disease, diarrheal disease, and stool carriage of NTS is poorly understood and transmission  routes  are  not  well-defined.  In  contrast  to  the  wellknown role of infected food-animals or contaminated food items in diarrheal Salmonella disease in industrialized countries, studies have failed to identify a major animal, food, or environmental reservoir of iNTS  in  Africa,  and  person-to-person  spread  may  play  a  relatively greater role in transmission [21]. The conditions in many hospitals in tropical Africa may also support nosocomial transmission, especially in the emergence of drug-resistant NTS.

============================================================

============================================================
DIARRHEAL DISEASE
Diarrheal disease caused by NTS in immunocompetent individuals is characterized by inflammatory mucosal disease, with inflammatory infiltrates in the lamina propria of  the ileum and colon, and crypt abscess formation (enterocolitis). A lack of colonic crypt architectural disturbance  may  be  helpful  in  distinguishing  infective  colitis  from
FIGURE  45.3 The  relationship  between  rainy  season  and  incidence  of invasive NTS in adults and children, by month, in Malawi, 2000-2004.
idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease on biopsy. Asymptomatic carriage in the stool may continue for several months. Antibiotic treatment is known to increase the rate and duration of carriage in the stool after an episode of Salmonella diarrhea.

============================================================
CHUNK 6
============================================================
INVASIVE DISEASE
NTS causing invasive disease likely invade through the small bowel mucosa causing a primary bacteremia. As many patients do not report gastrointestinal symptoms, such as pain or diarrhea, this may occur without overt inflammation. The lack of inflammation and diarrhea in HIV-infected patients may be because of a loss of mucosal Th17 T cells, leading to a lack of recruitment of neutrophils [22]. By the time patients present with fever, they usually already have an established disseminated  intracellular  infection  with  replication  in  the  bone marrow and reticuloendothelial  system,  as  well  as  bacteremia  (see Fig. 45.4) [23, 24]. This may be the explanation for the high rate of recrudescence,  even after  antibiotic  treatment.  Although  the pathogenesis of iNTS is reminiscent of that of enteric fever, classic complications of enteric fever such as small bowel perforation and hemorrhage are not usually seen in iNTS disease.

============================================================
MICROBIOLOGY
Salmonella is  a  genus  of  motile,  facultative  anerobic  Gram-negative bacilli closely related to Escherichia coli . Definitive diagnosis of iNTS disease is by aerobic blood culture, and of diarrheal NTS disease by stool culture in appropriate selective broth and plates. There are two species, S.  enterica and S.  bongori; all  Salmonellae  causing  human disease fall  within the  species S.  enterica ,  which has six subspecies. Human isolates usually fall within the subspecies enterica. A serologic method of typing devised by Kaufman and White, based on lipopolysaccharide  (LPS)  somatic  cell  wall  O  antigens,  envelope  antigens (eg Vi antigen) and phase 1 and phase 2 flagellar H antigens enables differentiation  of Salmonella into  serovars,  designated  with  names describing clinical syndromes  (e.g.  Choleraesuis,  Typhimurium, Enteritidis),  or  the  place  where  the  organism  was  described  (e.g.

Dublin,  Newport).  To  distinguish  serovars  from  species  and  subspecies,  they  are  notated  in  non-italicized  text  with  a  capital  letter (e.g. Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium, usually shortened to S . Typhimurium).
Among human isolates, Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi are considered 'typhoidal' and cause a human-restricted illness called enteric fever. All other serovars, which have a wider vertebrate host range, are considered 'non-typhoid Salmonellae', or NTS.
The vast majority of diarrheal illness is caused by only a few serovars, with S . Enteritidis, S. Typhimurium, S . Virchow, S . Newport, S . Hadar, S .  Heidelberg, S .  Agona,  and S .  Indiana  being  the  most  common globally, although data from the tropics are scanty.

============================================================
MICROBIOLOGY
Invasive Salmonella disease in the industrialized world is typically, but not exclusively, associated with serotypes S . Cholerasuis, S . Virchow, and S . Dublin. Invasive disease in tropical settings is most commonly caused by S .  Typhimurium and S .  Enteritidis.  A  novel  sub-Saharan African variant of S .  Typhimurium, designated ST313 has emerged, which has loss of genes required for an enteric lifestyle, similar to that seen  in S. Typhi,  suggesting  recent  evolution  of S .  Typhimurium towards a more human-adapted invasive lifestyle [24].
Antibiotic  resistance  is  an  emerging  problem  among  Salmonellae worldwide including among iNTS. Plasmid-borne multidrug resistance to chloramphenicol, cotrimoxazole and ampicillin is now documented from many sites in Africa. Resistance to fluoroquinolones or cephalosporins is not yet widespread in Africa, but is emerging and likely  to  continue  and  spread,  given  the  increasing  empiric  use  of these agents for bacterial infections during HIV infection [25].

============================================================
CHUNK 9
============================================================
DIARRHEAL NTS DISEASE
NTS enterocolitis presents with abdominal cramps, nausea and vomiting, and watery diarrhea, which may also be bloody in severe cases. Patients may be febrile, and 1-4% of adults have a transient bacteremia, which may lead to focal or metastatic infection, particularly in elderly patients. In severe cases, enterocolitis may be accompanied by shock related to dehydration or to associated sepsis. Diarrheal illness usually lasts  2-5  days,  resolving  spontaneously.  Complications including toxic colonic dilatation and perforation may be heralded by  a  prolonged  disease  course,  severe  pain,  abdominal  tenderness, signs of peritonitis or shock. Diarrheal disease may be followed by seronegative reactive arthritis or Reiter's syndrome.

============================================================
CHUNK 10
============================================================
INVASIVE DISEASE (iNTS)
The usual presentation of iNTS is a nonspecific febrile illness and the frequency of common presenting clinical features is shown in Table 45-1. As these data show, the clinical picture is heterogeneous and there may be no obvious clinical focus. Diarrhea is often absent. The clinical  picture  may  be  complicated  by  co-infections-especially  in HIV-infected  patients-including  respiratory,  such  as  tuberculosis (TB) , S. pneumoniae or Klebsiella spp. A concurrent respiratory infection may cause a simultaneous intravascular Gram-negative sepsis to be  overlooked  [19].  In  young  children  especially,  there  is  clinical overlap  with  the  presentation  of  pneumonia,  severe  malaria,  and anemia [26]. This means that clinical diagnosis is especially difficult in the resource-limited setting and that empiric antibiotic treatment must have broad coverage (see below). Mortality associated with an index event of iNTS is very high (25-50%), even in microbiologically confirmed cases with appropriate antibiotic treatment [19, 25, 27].
In  adults,  iNTS  generally  presents  during  stage  4  HIV  disease  and 80% of patients at index presentation have a CD4 count of below 200 cells/ μ l.  Features  of  advanced  HIV  disease  may  be  present.  Other causes  of  immunosuppression  should be sought in the  absence of HIV in adults.

============================================================
CHUNK 11
============================================================
RECURRENT iNTS DISEASE
Recurrence of NTS bacteremia occurs in 30-40% of survivors, even after  2  weeks  of  antibiotic treatment. Relapse  is  typically seen after 2-6 weeks and represents a recrudescence with the same index isolate. The number of viable bacteria is higher in bone marrow at relapse compared with the first presentation, suggesting an established intracellular niche. Re-treatment with antibiotics is not always successful, and  25%  of  patients  with  one  recurrence  go  on  to  have  multiple recurrences [19]. If ART is available, successful immune reconstitution appears to greatly reduce the risk of iNTS recurrence.

============================================================
CHUNK 12
============================================================
FOCAL AND SUPPURATIVE NTS DISEASE
Salmonellae have a capacity to cause focal suppurative disease [28]. This  is  a  problem  in  the  elderly,  in  young  children  with  diarrheal disease and transient bacteremia, in immunosuppressed patients, and in children with invasive NTS infection. There is a particular predeliction to cause osteomyelitis and pyogenic arthritis, particularly in sickle cell disease [29]. Intravascular infections at structurally damaged sites, such as atheroma, aneurysms, or damaged heart valves cause persistent  bacteremia,  usually  require  combined  surgical  and  medical therapy, and have a poor outcome. Focal infections during HIV are

also described in the chest (empyema and, rarely, primary pneumonia), renal tract, genital tract, and hepatobiliary tract [20].
NTS  meningitis  in  adults  and  children  in  Africa  has  a  very  poor outcome  (60%  mortality  among  children,  80%  mortality  among adults) [13, 30], and subdural or epidural empyema are also described. Of particular note in the tropics is a phenomenon where active schistosomiasis is associated with persistent or recurrent NTS bacteremia among children, despite antibiotic treatment. This occurs because the bacterium is able to adhere to the adult helminth's tegument using a  bacterial  pilus,  providing  it  with  a  sanctuary  where  it  can  evade antimicrobial treatment. Treatment with praziquantel kills the adult  helminth,  and  allows  effective  antibiotic  eradication  of  the Salmonella with prompt resolution of fever [31].

============================================================
CHUNK 15
============================================================
PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The  two  most  common  clinical  syndromes  arising  from  NTS  are enterocolitis with diarrheal disease or invasive disease with sepsis. In resource-limited settings it  is usually necessary  to take a syndromic approach to evaluating these two modes of presentation.

============================================================
CHUNK 16
============================================================
DIARRHEAL DISEASE
Acute  febrile  diarrheal  disease  is  usually  presumed  to  be  infective unless  specific  features  suggest  other  diagnoses  or  complications. Evaluation should include assessment of history, duration, fever, pain, shock,  dehydration,  urine  output,  and  careful  examination  of  the abdomen. The abdominal pain may be severe and the clinical picture may  resemble  one  of  appendicitis.  Simple  stool  microscopy  may show  polymorphic  inflammatory  cells.  Stool  may  be  positive  for occult  or  occasionally  frank  blood,  but  this  is  not  diagnostically helpful. Plain abdominal film or sigmoidoscopy are necessary only if toxic  dilatation,  other  complications,  or  alternative  diagnoses  are suspected.

============================================================
CHUNK 17
============================================================
INVASIVE DISEASE
The nonspecific clinical features  seen in iNTS (Table 45-1), limited access to laboratory and microbiology facilities, and the emergence of multi-drug resistance make iNTS a challenging illness to diagnose and manage in resource-limited settings. Although definitive diagnosis of iNTS is by blood culture, these facilities are not widely available in sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, an empiric approach to diagnosis and management is often necessary.
An  approach  often  used  among  children  is  to  'rule  out'  malaria through blood film or malaria antigen card test. However, because of the association of pediatric malaria with iNTS, malaria parasitemia does not rule out iNTS or other co-infections. Differential diagnosis of patients presenting in the tropics with fever as their primary complaint must include malaria, TB, and pneumococcal sepsis in addition to iNTS. Among adults, HIV testing and staging is essential, and presentation  with  iNTS  defines  stage  4  HIV  disease.  Given  the  strong association of iNTS with advanced HIV disease, co-infection with any, and  all,  of  these  pathogens  must  also  be  considered.  Presentation with  NTS  bacteremia  and  concomitant  pneumonia  caused  by  a second  pathogen  is  particularly  diagnostically  challenging  among both  adults  and  children.  Many  children  with  iNTS  also  meet  the World Health Organization (WHO) case definition for acute lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), and empiric treatment for pneumonia may not cover NTS disease [26].
In  a  study of clinical predictors  of blood  stream pathogens among febrile admissions in Africa, splenomegaly with high fever ( > 39°C) conferred a high independent odds ratio (4.9) for NTS bacteremia. Surprisingly,  splenomegaly  did  not  predict  malaria  or  TB.  Splenomegaly may, therefore, be a useful clinical marker of iNTS disease in adults in an HIV-prevalent setting [32], but it is only found in 3040% of cases.

============================================================
CHUNK 18
============================================================
DIARRHEAL DISEASE
Management of enterocolitis caused  by NTS should be supportive; antibiotic  treatment  is  not  indicated  except  in  severe,  or  complicated, cases.  In cases  of  dysentery (grossly bloody diarrhea), where an  etiologic  agent  is  not  sought  or  identified,  empiric  antibiotic therapy should be directed against Shigella species, which are more common causes  of  dysentery  and  also  derive  a  clear  benefit  from treatment.  In  contrast,  antibiotics  do  not  reduce  the  duration  of diarrheal  illness  caused  by  NTS,  and  they  prolong  stool  shedding and increase the risk of side effects from  treatment  itself (evidence grade 1).

============================================================
CHUNK 19
============================================================
INVASIVE DISEASE
The choice of empiric therapy for febrile patients requiring hospital admission in an HIV-endemic area is difficult. Reliance on narrowspectrum penicillin, even if respiratory features are prominent, may miss  cases  of  iNTS.  There  is  also  widespread  resistance  of  iNTS  to chloramphenicol, ampicillin and co-trimoxazole.  Broader-spectrum cover (see below) may be considered necessary and judged according to known local antimicrobial resistance patterns and local availability of antimicrobials. If an antibiotic or combination of antibiotics inactive  against  iNTS  fails  to  cause  defervescence  and  clinical  improvement in febrile patients after 48 hours, consideration should be given to changing to a regimen with activity against NTS.
Antibiotics which may be available and effective against NTS include third-generation cephalosporins (such as ceftriaxone), fluoroquinolones (such as ciprofloxacin), and the macrolide azithromycin. However, there have been no clinical trials for iNTS disease to provide guidance. Fluoroquinolones  probably  offer  superior  intracellular  penetration and reduce the risk of recurrence (evidence grade 4), but the risks of using fluoroquinolones include partial treatment of disseminated TB which may obscure the diagnosis and generate drug resistance. Short courses of fluoroquinolones, as are used in typhoid fever, should be avoided in iNTS because of the high rate of recurrence seen in this disease.  If  a  microbiologic  diagnosis  of  iNTS  is  confirmed,  then  a course of 14 days of an effective antimicrobial should be used.

============================================================
CHUNK 20
============================================================
INVASIVE DISEASE
Failure to improve on an effective agent should lead the clinician to consider  TB  as  an  alternative  or  additional  diagnosis.  However,  in some cases of iNTS, even in the setting of appropriate therapy, resolution of fever may take several days. A clinical search should also be made for focal suppurative complications. Prolonged antibiotic treatment, for at least 6-8 weeks, is required for focal sepsis, along with drainage  of  any  pus  collection.  Needle  aspiration  of  infected  large joints is an acceptable first step, but formal surgical drainage may be necessary if there is a poor response (evidence grade 2). Joints should not be immobilized during treatment, but movement allowed as pain permits. Outcomes for septic arthritis can be excellent if well-managed. Our experience of NTS empyema is that prolonged chest drainage is required,  with  antibiotic  treatment,  but  results were disappointing. Treatment of infected heart valves and vascular structures frequently requires  a  combination  of  surgical  and  prolonged  antibiotic  treatment, and outcomes following mycotic aneurysm infection are especially  poor.  Treatment  with  praziquantel  to  eradicate  possible  live schistosomal helminths in endemic areas is safe and may be helpful (evidence grade 4).

============================================================
CHUNK 21
============================================================
PREVENTION OF RECURRENCE
iNTS frequently recrudesces from an intracellular site of persistence in HIV-positive adults [19, 23]. Although prolonged courses of fluoroquinolones (i.e. 4-6 weeks of ciprofloxacin) have been suggested for treatment and secondary prevention in guidelines from industrialized countries (evidence grade 5), this is based on expert opinion in settings with low prevalence of TB and in the pre-ART era. Prolonged therapy has not been subject to clinical trials or cost-benefit analysis, and its impact on broader antimicrobial resistance has not yet been assessed.  This  is  particularly  important  as  fluoroquinolones  are  a mainstay of treatment for multidrug-resistant TB.
The impact of ART and cotrimoxazole preventive therapy on preventing recurrence in HIV-infected adults and children remains unknown. However, as recrudescence is often early, resistance to cotrimoxazole and logistical difficulties in early initiation of ARVs may reduce the impact of these interventions. Clinical trials of strategies to prevent recurrence without compromising antimicrobial efficacy are urgently needed. As there are no satisfactory evidence-based options for prevention,  expectant  management  with  retreatment  of  iNTS  with  an effective agent as it recurs remains the best option (evidence grade 5).

============================================================
CHUNK 22
============================================================
VACCINATION
There is currently no vaccine for NTS. Antibody is likely to be protective,  and  a  deficiency  of  antibody  against  NTS  has  been  shown  in susceptible  African  children  [8].  Among  some  HIV-infected  adults, however, the observation has been made that  there is an excess of inhibitory antiSalmonella antibodies directed again LPS, that compete with  killing  antibodies.  This  raises  the  possibility  that  a  vaccine directed  against  LPS  might  do  harm,  so  a  vaccine  directed  against Salmonella membrane proteins or other targets would be more appropriate [33].
