Key features
- Though the most common culprits of acute dermatoses in the tropics are infectious agents, important in%ammatory dermatoses should be considered, which often mimic infectious diseases
- When considering the di$erential diagnosis of an acute eruption, the primary morphology of the lesion is the most important factor to identify during the physical examination
- Due to signi#cant interactions between systemic medications as well as poor excretion of drugs through the skin, topical regimens are often #rst-line agents that su&ce in the therapy of most cutaneous disorders. However, exceptions do exist, particularly in the case of cutaneous manifestations of systemic infections as well as in%ammatory autoimmune bullous disorders such as pemphigus
- Whenever the primary morphology of the lesion and/or its distribution are not su&cient for diagnosis, skin biopsy may be indicated, particularly to evaluate the primary e$ector cell in the in#ltrate (i.e. lymphocyte, neutrophil or eosinophil)
In this chapter,  we  will highlight those  dermatologic disorders and presentations that  are  either  more  commonly  found  in  tropical  or resource-limited regions, or that most frequently enter the differential diagnosis in such areas. Emphasis is placed on the physical examination.  For  ease  of  creating  a  differential  diagnosis,  diseases  are  discussed based on the predominant primary lesion and symptoms they cause. Special mention is made of those diseases that have multiple morphologies  or  transition  to  different  appearance  as  the  disease evolves. For detailed discussion on the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment for individual disorders, please refer to the corresponding disease-specific chapter.

VESICLES/BULLAE
Vesicles and  bullae  are fluid-filled  lesions. Herpetic involvement of the skin classically includes a vesicular phase, and is among the most common dermatoses encountered by the clinician. Herpetic vesicles lay on an erythematous base, and the lesions ulcerate and eventually heal  with  crusting.  Traditionally,  herpetic  ulcers  show  a  scalloped border with serosanguineous drainage, pain at the site, and, occasionally, ipsilateral lymphadenopathy. Chronic disease may lead to scarring. The patient experiences early dysesthesias at the site of a future eruption in recurrent disease. Most importantly, the diagnosis should be  suspected  in  those  with  chronic  ulcers,  particularly  if  they  are immunosuppressed.  Though  HSV-1  is  more  common  in  orofacial disease and HSV-2 in genital lesions, both strains can be seen in either location. Often a fixed location in the body is noted; however, primary disease can affect any area of the body.
Zoster  infection  is  caused  by  reactivation  of  varicella  (chickenpox) virus  that  has  laid  dormant  in  basal  root  ganglia.  Zoster  usually presents with crop-like vesicles  along a dermatome. Zoster can disseminate, especially in immunocompromised patients. Greater than 20 lesions outside a dermatome should raise suspicion for dissemination. Ulcerations may be chronic, especially in immunocompromised patients. It is important to remember this diagnosis, particularly when steroid-responsive  diagnoses  such  as  pseudo-vesicular  Sweet's  syndrome (or idiopathic neutrophilic dermatosis) are considered, as oral steroid  use  in  patients  with  disseminated  zoster can be  lethal.  The occasionally  necrotic  center  of  evolving  lesions  may  easily  be  confused for a primary vasculitis. It is important to note, however, that vasculitis  seen in  the  setting  of  zoster  is  usually  reactive  and  not  a primary disease requiring steroids or cytotoxic medication, even when it is clearly present on skin biopsy.

VESICLES/BULLAE
Pemphigus foliaceous is an autoimmune blistering disease overrepresented in the tropics. It is caused when pathogenic immunoglobulins against  intraepidermal  desmoglein  1  destroy  intercellular  connections, leading to single cell detachment. As little to no desmoglein 1 is  expressed  in  mucosal  skin,  pemphigus  foliaceous  is  primarily  a disease of cutaneous surfaces, sparing the eyes and mouth. The blisters in pemphigus foliaceous are not tense, but flaccid (Fig. 8.1). They are readily expanded when side pressure is exerted, and further separation is created between the superficial layers of skin, the so-called Nikolsky's sign. It is important to highlight, however, that vesicles may only be seen in the acute, early phases of disease. Because these blisters are so fragile, by the time the patient presents for care, the physical examination  is  notable  for  crusted  and  scaly  papules,  erosions,  or  even psoriatic-like disease. The disease is strikingly photosensitive, so that the scalp and upper extremities and shawl distribution may be disproportionately affected.
Fogo selvagem refers to a prominent intensely inflammatory response with vesicles and bullae that can follow a fly bite in areas of South America. It is usually treated with steroids.

VASCULAR PAPULES AND NODULES (ANGIOMATOUS LESIONS)
Angiomatous lesions are reddish papules or nodules due to vascular proliferation and dilatation. Kaposi sarcoma, verruga peruana, pyogenic granulomas, cherry angiomas and pseudo-Kaposi can all present with these vascular lesions. If they are more nodular and deeper in the skin, the angiomata may appear violaceous.
Carrion disease is caused by Bartonella bacilliformis in  focal  areas  of South America, and has two phases: Oroya fever and verruga peruana. In Oroya fever, soon after initial infection, fever, hemolysis, malaise, headaches and musculoskeletal pain develop. If the patient survives, the acute illness is followed by the chronic phase, verruga peruana, in
FIGURE 8.1 Pemphigus foliaceous. Note the presence of Baccid blisters on a  mildly  inBammatory  border.  Unlike  herpetic  bullae  or  erosions,  the lesions  of  pemphigus  foliaceous  are  usually  photodistributed,  can  be larger,  and  are  often  fragile,  so  the  patient  rarely  presents  with  intact blisters.

which the patient develops multiple angiomatous lesions on the skin. These reddish papules or  nodules sometimes have a collarette and may be eroded. They are very similar to the lesions seen in bacillary angiomatosis.
Bacillary  angiomatosis  caused  by Bartonella  henselae and Bartonella quintana most  commonly  affects  immunosuppressed  patients.  Red angiomatous  papules  or  nodules  are  very  characteristic  (Fig.  8.2). There is a great variation in the number of lesions that may develop. The lesions may bleed and erode and cause regional lymphadenopathy,  as  well  as  peliosis,  blood-filled  cystic  spaces  in  the  liver  and spleen.

VASCULAR PAPULES AND NODULES (ANGIOMATOUS LESIONS)
Kaposi sarcoma due to human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) is in the differential  diagnosis  of  angiomatous  lesions,  and  it  is  necessary  to biopsy the lesion to ascertain the diagnosis. Lesions begin as macules, but develop into papules and then nodules, with symmetric, widespread reddish,  violaceous or  blue-black  lesions.  Edema  can  be  an accompanying  sign.  There  are  five  different  types,  with  the  AIDSassociated  type  commonly being the presenting manifestation that leads to a diagnosis of HIV. Gastrointestinal and pulmonary involvement by Kaposi sarcoma can lead to death from hemorrhage, hemoptysis or bowel obstruction.

PETECHIAE AND PURPURA
Purpura is blood that has leaked out of the vasculature into the skin but  remains  visible.  If  it  occurs  as  small  spots,  it  is  referred  to  as petechiae; if  it  occurs  in  larger  areas  and  in  deeper  structures,  it  is called ecchymoses. Characteristically, purpura will not blanch under pressure since the erythrocytes have escaped in the tissue and are no longer within compressible vessels. Common causes include coagulopathies,  trauma,  nutritional  deficiencies,  vasculitides,  medicines such as aspirin and warfarin (Coumadin), and infections.
Rickettsial diseases have a predilection for the microvasculature, often causing  petechiae.  During  louse-borne  epidemic  typhus  caused  by Rickettsia prowazekii and flea-borne endemic typhus caused by Rickettsia typhi , an erythematous macular eruption occurs on the trunk and spreads centrifugally, sparing the face, palms and soles. Patients are febrile  and  appear  toxic.  During  Rocky  Mountain  spotted  fever (RMSF), the eruption begins in the extremities, often involving the wrists, and spreads centripetally. In severe typhus and RMSF, the eruption may become hemorrhagic with gangrene of the distal structures - nose, fingertips, toes and earlobes.
Mite-borne scrub typhus is caused by Rickettsia tsutsugamushi , and the primary skin lesion is an erythematous papule at the site of inoculation  by  the  mite,  which  is  commonly  in  the  genital  area  or  legs. The original papule may form a vesicle and ultimately evolve into an ulcer  with  a  necrotic  eschar  and  surrounding  indurated  erythema with locoregional lymphadenopathy. A pink macular eruption may develop on the trunk and extend peripherally. Tinnitus and deafness can occur in untreated cases.

PETECHIAE AND PURPURA
Patients with rickettsial spotted fevers such as RMSF, Mediterranean spotted  fever,  North  Asian  tick  typhus,  and  others  most  frequently present with fever, headache, and an initially pink macular eruption on the extremities that spreads centripetally, and may develop into an erythematous  papular  eruption  which  becomes  hemorrhagic  and petechial. Though the face is often spared, the palms and soles are frequently involved,  which  should  raise  the  suspicion  of  rickettsial illness.
Patients with bacterial meningitis due to Neisseria meningitides often present with fever and rash, the latter classically including petechiae. A useful clue is finding lesions on areas of skin pressure such as at the waist,  where belts  are  worn,  or  shoulders,  where  a  strap  may  have been resting. A patient may lack the hemorrhagic signs, and only have a  morbilliform exanthem, even  in the  setting  of  photophobia and nuchal rigidity.
Patients with leptospirosis, caused by spirochetes of the genus Leptospira , can present with fever, hepatic and renal dysfunction, conjunctival suffusion, jaundice and a petechial eruption.
Patients with dengue fever may present with petechial lesions. Fever and myalgia in a patient from the Caribbean or Southeast Asia should prompt  consideration  of  the  diagnosis.  The  rash  in  dengue  may extend to the trunk, and does not resemble dependent vasculitis as is seen in leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Hyperemia and a diffuse macular rash with central islands of sparing may be seen.

ULCERS/VERRUCOUS PLAQUES
Many diseases begin as an ulcer and later develop into a verrucous or warty plaque. Tuberculosis primarily affects the lung, although it can occasionally primarily involve the skin. Following direct inoculation into skin,  a  firm,  red-brown  papule may  develop which  ultimately ulcerates  into  a  chancre  and  is  covered  by  a  dark,  adherent  crust. Sometimes  the bacteria-rich ulcer is associated with erythema nodosum and may eventually spontaneously heal.
Tuberculosis verrucosa cutis occurs by direct contact. A papule forming a verrucous plaque with centrifugal progression and central scarring is typical.
Scrofula and scrofuloderma result when there is contiguous spread from underlying necrotic tuberculoid lymph nodes. The neck is the most common site of involvement. A firm, deep, adherent, purple-red nodule  may  become  fluctuant,  suppurate  or  ulcerate,  and  form  a fistula. Less commonly, self-inoculation near natural orifices can lead to tuberculosis cutis orificialis that appears as yellow-red nodules in or near the mucosa. These lesions frequently ulcerate and are tender.

Lupus vulgaris is a destructive process that usually involves the face, leaving central atrophy. Lupus vulgaris needs to be differentiated from leishmaniasis,  sarcoidosis,  discoid  lupus  erythematosus,  cutaneous T-cell  lymphoma,  tuberculoid  leprosy,  pyodermatitis  vegetans  and paracoccidioidomycosis.  Dermatologic  manifestations  of  disseminated miliary tuberculosis include papules and pustules that are diffusely  distributed  throughout  the  body.  Papulonecrotic  tuberculids are firm, pustulonecrotic, symmetric papules on the extensor surfaces that resolve over several weeks. Lichen scrofulosorum consists of tiny, flat-topped,  keratotic  papules  on  the  trunk  which  grow  in  groups. Erythema induratum appears as symmetric, erythematous subcutaneous nodules on the posterior calves with overlying atrophy and slight scale, commonly in middle-aged women. It is thought to be a hypersensitivity  reaction  during  tuberculosis.  Erythema  nodosum  may appear similar, but is more often on the shins, is more painful, and does not ulcerate.
Skin lesions can also be due to nontuberculous mycobacteria. Rapidly growing M. fortuitum and M. chelonae/abscessus can cause subcutaneous abscesses  or cellulitides. M. marinum can  lead to erosions, verrucous papules or plaques, and is commonly acquired from aquariums or lakes. M. marinum, M. kansasii and other nontuberculous mycobacteria can cause lesions in a sporotrichoid (lymphangitic) pattern (Fig. 8.3). M. ulcerans is the cause of Buruli ulcer, a chronic process that first manifests as a solitary, indurated, painless nodule that ulcerates and develops undermined borders. Buruli ulcers most often affect children living in  Australia  and  Africa,  and  less  frequently  in Latin America.

Rickettsialpox is caused by Rickettsia akari and transmitted by the bite of rodent-associated mites. At the site of inoculation, an erythematous papule first occurs, which then develops into a vesicle that then ruptures and ulcerates. An eschar can occur. There is often an accompanying papulovesicular eruption, as well as regional lymphadenopathy, and patients are febrile and report headache and myalgia.
FIGURE 8.3 Atypical mycobacteria. These papulonodular lesions assemble almost in a linear distribution, suggestive of lymphangitic spread. Note the lack of scale or ulceration that could otherwise resemble papulonecrotic tuberculid.
Cutaneous  anthrax,  caused  by Bacillus  anthracis ,  is  usually  due  to contact with livestock, animal products or soil. Initially, there is pruritus  at  the  site  of  inoculation,  followed  by  the  development  of  a papule. Vesicles may surround the papule and coalesce until there is rupture and formation of a 4-6-cm ulcer. There is significant perilesional edema. The ulcer develops a thick black, depressed, painless eschar  that  is  characteristic  of  the  disease.  Cutaneous infection  can cause systemic illness. The differential diagnosis includes orf, bullous impetigo,  plague,  a  burn,  rickettsial  eschar,  ecthyma  gangrenosum and cutaneous diphtheria, although perilesional edema surrounding an  eschar  strongly  suggests  cutaneous  anthrax.  In  addition  to  the cutaneous form of anthrax, which represents 95% of cases, there are also  gastrointestinal  and  pulmonary  anthrax  that  follow  ingestion and inhalation of spores, respectively.

Plague is caused by Yersinia pestis carried by fleas and is maintained in a number of rodent reservoirs. At the site of a flea bite, a papule, pustule, vesicle, ulcer or eschar may develop, and patients have high fever and appear systemically ill. Regional lymph nodes may become swollen, warm and very tender (buboes). If the bacteria enter into the blood,  disseminated  intravascular  coagulopathy,  sepsis,  petechiae, purpura fulminans and acral gangrene can occur.
Cutaneous diphtheria, caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae , presents in  a  variety  of  ways,  including  an  anesthetic  ulcer  called  ecthyma diphthericum which begins as a vesicle. A membrane may be adherent. Infection  of  the  respiratory tract  causes  a  low-grade  fever,  sore throat, and purulent nasal discharge which may become erosive. An adherent grayish pseudomembrane may develop on the tonsils, with significant 'bull neck' cervical edema and lymphadenopathy.
Cancrum oris or noma pudenda is a progressive polymicrobial infection of the face that leads to destruction and ulceration, most commonly in severely malnourished children.

In Old World cutaneous leishmaniasis, a papule first forms at the site of  a  sandfly  bite.  Next,  a  well-defined  ulcer  with  surrounding  erythema, crusting and variable pyoderma is usually noted. The 'oriental sore' may also exhibit undermined ulcer edges that have been confused  for  smaller  lesions  of  pyoderma  gangrenosum.  Most  lesions heal  with  minimal  scarring,  atrophy  or  depigmentation  in  a  selflimited fashion  over  6-24 months. The lesions may vary wildly in size  and  depth,  as  smaller  satellite  lesions  may  coalesce  with  the primary ulcer. Ulcers may be 'wet' or 'dry.' Leishmanial lesions are not painful. Hyperkeratotic variants occur. In diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis (DCL), the initial papule rarely ulcerates, but rather, several other papules appear with minimal erythema or pigmentation outwardly  spreading  from  the  initial  site.  As  lesions  evolve,  they  may become deeper  and  nodular.  A  chronic  form  of  cutaneous  disease called leishmania recidivans causes sarcoidal-appearing lesions, with outwardly  enlarging  dermal  induration  and  central  clearance.  If pressed against a glass slide, the erythematous to violaceous coloration  and  dusky  nature  of  the  lesion  may  blanche  into  an  'applegreen'  appearance,  reflecting  the  presence  of  histiocytes  and  other chronic inflammatory cells in tissue. Post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) refers to diffuse nodular involvement that occurs following  resolution  of  visceral  leishmaniasis  (kala-azar).  Multiple primary  morphologies  may  be  noted,  including  diffuse  macules, papules and nodules.
Cutaneous  New  World  leishmaniasis  appears  similar  to  the  Old World variant. A specific New World mucocutaneous manifestation of L.  braziliensis is  termed  espundia.  Following  resolution  of  a  primary  skin  lesion,  leishmania  infection  can relapse, specifically involving oro-naso-mucosal membranes, including the nasal septum, pharynx,  larynx  and  buccal  mucosa.  Untreated,  mucocutaneous leishmaniasis can be disfiguring and can lead to central destruction of the face.

SUBCUTANEOUS MYCOSES
Direct inoculation of a fungus into the skin, often by a splinter  or other trauma, may result in a subcutaneous mycosis. Clinically, subcutaneous mycoses result in an ulcer or verrucous plaque. The most common types are sporotrichosis, mycetoma, chromoblastomycosis, phaeohyphomycosis and lobomycosis. Treatment can be difficult and may require long courses of oral antifungals, cryotherapy or surgical excision, alone or in combination.
Sporotrichosis  is  caused  by Sporothrix  schenckii and  follows  direct inoculation, classically involving thorns or cats' claws. Lymphangitic spread is common. This type of sporotrichoid spread is also seen in atypical mycobacteriosis,  leishmaniasis and nocardiosis, and differs from regional lymphadenopathy.
Chromoblastomycosis usually manifests as a classic verrucous plaque. Central atrophy with scarring may also be seen. Chromoblastomycosis is due to dematiaceous (melanin-producing) fungi, often Fonsecaea pedrosoi , and most commonly involves the lower extremities of individuals involved in soil-related occupations.
Phaeohyphomycosis can manifest in a number of ways, most commonly as black eschars with scalloped, erythematous borders. Subcutaneous abscesses should be excised.
Lobomycosis due to Lacazia loboi is reported in areas of Latin America, and manifests  as  asymptomatic,  smooth-surfaced,  keloidal  lesions, often on the ear.
Mycetoma, or Madura foot, is caused by bacteria (actinomycetoma) or fungi (eumycetoma). The clinical presentation is one of an asymptomatic, subcutaneous swelling with sinus tracts that discharge 'granules' or 'grains.' Granules from bacteria tend to be lighter in color, whereas  granules  from  fungi  tend  to  be  dark.  Radiologic  imaging should be performed as bone involvement is common.

SUBCUTANEOUS MYCOSES
Zygomycoses are divided into two types - the opportunistic type typified  by mucormycosis that affects hosts immunosuppressed by diseases other than AIDS, such as diabetes, and entomophthoromycosis that affects immunocompetent hosts living in the tropics. Mucormycosis  commonly  presents  around  the  nose,  forming  black  necrotic tissue and involving the orbit and brain, while entomophthoromycosis forms a solitary, painless nodule or slowly expansile mass, most commonly on an extremity.

CHUNK 15
============================================================
DEEP MYCOSES
Aside from subcutaneous mycoses, deep cutaneous fungal infections often result from systemic infection. The cutaneous presentations are protean. Sometimes, cutaneous infection causes erythema nodosum, sterile, tender erythematous nodules on the shin which have a favorable prognosis. Other times, there is a nonspecific presentation such as  a  morbilliform eruption. Accompanying signs and symptoms of fever, gastrointestinal upset and emaciation aid in the diagnosis of a systemic infection.
Histoplasmosis  may  present  with  mucocutaneous  ulcerations  and granulomas. Care must be taken not to misdiagnose as sarcoidosis. Children sometimes present with purpura, fever, fatigue and gastrointestinal symptoms. Blastomycosis is endemic in North America and often affects the bone, particularly ribs and vertebrae along with the skin.  The  cutaneous  lesions  are  multiple,  growing  slowly,  forming verrucous and granulomatous lesions with thick crust overlying granulation tissue and sometimes central white scars. Paracoccidioidomycosis is endemic in Latin America. It may present with mucocutaneous disease, most commonly of the gingiva, with small papules and ulcerations.  The  disease  is  fifteen  times  more  common  in  men  than  in women. Penicilliosis is endemic in Southeast Asia, sometimes causing umbilicated  papules  or  oral  lesions.  Cryptococcus  has  a  particular affinity for the central nervous system and skin.
In  patients  with AIDS, coccidioidomycosis,  histoplasmosis,  penicilliosis  and  molluscum  contagiosum  may  all  appear  as  umbilicated vesicles,  and  be  indistinguishable  on  clinical  examination.  Primary cutaneous  lesions  may  present  with  verrucous  papules  or  ulcers similar to subcutaneous mycoses.

PAINLESS PAPULES
Molluscum contagiosum manifests as umbilicated papules that can coalesce  into  plaques.  Clinicians  may  confuse  the  diagnosis  with herpetic disease, but relatively simple bedside maneuvers can assist in diagnosis. Lancing lesions of molluscum leads to extravasation of a 'white cheesy material' which can be stained with hematoxylin and eosin, revealing eosinophilic globules. In the patient with unknown HIV status, confluent  facial molluscum contagiosum is a reason to test for HIV. Therapy is often via destruction with curettage or cryotherapy, or with reconstitution of the immune system in those with deficiencies.

PAINFUL PAPULES/URTICARIA
Infestation  of  skin  with  fly  larvae  is  called  myiasis.  A  large,  tender, cyst-like  structure  or  papule  may  be  noted  with  surrounding  erythema,  a  central  punctum  and  occasional  suppuration.  Patients usually report movement within the lesions. Lesions may be multiple. New World myiasis is caused by the botfly; Old World disease is most commonly caused by the tumbu fly. Treatment involves asphyxiating the  larvae,  usually  via  application  of  an  occlusive  dressing  or  substance, followed by larval extrusion. Surgical excision may sometimes be required. Bacterial suprainfection can occur.
Tungiasis (also called jiggers) is caused by Tunga penetrans , the sand flea. The female flea burrows into skin, usually on the feet, but can involve any exposed skin area, creating a callus-like papule, often with some hyperpigmentation. The terminus of the flea is often visible in the center of the lesion. Pain is usually present. Treatment involves mechanical removal.
Many insect bites  and  plant  dermatitides  occur  in  the  tropics.  The physical  examination  is  often  helpful  at  suggesting  the  diagnosis. Insect bites may result in erythematous papules of variable size and distribution. Urticarial-like erythema is seen around lesions, at times enlarging far over 10 cm in diameter. A number of beetles, millipedes and  centipedes  can  cause  a  severe  contact  dermatitis.  Plant  dermatitides may manifest in both acute and chronic forms, depending on the repetitive nature of contact. Whereas contact dermatitis is the most  common  presentation,  characterized  by  vesicles  on  an  erythematous base in a linear or geographic distribution, chronic disease may present as eczematous dermatitis. Occupational disease, as seen in florists or gardeners, can present as atopic dermatitis of the hands, with severe dryness, scaling, cracking, erythema, and even fibrotic-like constriction in palmar function.

PRURITUS AND PAPULES
Schistosomal cercarial dermatitis can occur at the site of skin penetration  with  the  infectious  form  of Schistosoma spp.  following  water exposure. Nonhuman Schistosome spp.,  especially avian species, can cause  prominent  dermatitis  that  may  manifest  as  multiple,  highly pruritic,  erythematous  papules.  Distribution  is  of  skin  exposed  to infectious water. Seabather's eruption can cause similar lesions but is caused by larval forms of coelenterates (jelly fish), but distribution usually reflects a 'bathing suit' distribution, since the larvae become entrapped by clothing. Pediculosis (or lice) is caused by louse infestation. Different lice are responsible for each form of human involvement:  corporis  (body),  capitis  (head)  and  pubis  (genitals).  Louse infestation  can  result  in  pruritus  and  excoriations.  The  body  louse ( Pediculus  humanus  corporis )  takes  a  daily  blood  meal,  but  lives  in clothing.  It  is  transmitted  from  person  to  person,  usually  in  overcrowded and impoverished conditions, and during periods of war and social unrest. The head louse ( Pediculus humanus capitis ) is also transmitted from person to person. It is particularly common in schoolaged children. Pubic lice ( Phthirus pubis ) are spread by sexual contact, creating intense pruritus in the groin, commonly known as 'crabs' .
Lice  can  be  seen  adherent  to  pubic  hair.  Symptoms  are  regional, although lice and nits may occasionally be seen on eyelashes.

PRURITUS AND PAPULES
Scabies is an important infestation caused by Sarcoptes scabei mites; it is often misdiagnosed. The organism burrows superficially, just underneath the  stratum corneum. It does not penetrate the  skin, and as such it is not a true infection. Contrary to common belief, dermatitis does not occur immediately following infestation. Dermatitis occurs as a hypersensitivity reaction created by the mite, its eggs or its excrement, termed scybala. Clinical findings vary according to the immune status of the host. Immunocompetent patients suffer from extreme pruritus. Close inspection reveals erythematous papules or nodules, with  superficial  crusting  and  excoriation,  and  there  is  a  particular predilection for involvement of genital, intertriginous and acral skin (Fig. 8.4). In immunosuppressed hosts, the infirm, or institutionalized patients, a functionally debilitating pruritic dermatosis can occur. There  is  a  specific  association  of  severe  scabies  and  infection  with HTLV-1.  In  these  severe  cases,  patients  present  with  disseminated eczematous dermatitis,  nodules  and,  occasionally,  generalized  urticaria.  Late  findings  include  hyperpigmentation,  lichenification  and psoriatic-like lesions. Also denoted Norwegian or crusted scabies, this diffuse involvement may progress to wart-like lesions. In the elderly, lesions may appear bullous, often mimicking bullous pemphigoid. In the newborn, lesions may be vesicular, and the disease may present as failure to thrive. Pustular diseases of the newborn, including acropustulosis and neonatal acne, may be considered, but the disseminated nature of the disease, examination of the vesicular fluid, as well as  a  diagnostic  examination of  a  scraping  following  application  of mineral  oil  to  identify  mites  or  their  products,  can  quickly  aid  in making the correct diagnosis. Topical treatments for limited disease include  permethrin  5%  cream,  lindane,  crotamiton  10%

PRURITUS AND PAPULES
cream, sulfur, malathion and ivermectin lotion. Crusted or nodular scabies and disease in the immunosuppressed often require systemic ivermectin at 200 mcg/kg. The entire family, including pets, should be treated, and clothes, bedding, and frequently used fomites should be immediately  washed  in  warm  water.  A  second  treatment  a  week  after  is usually recommended. Oral antipruritics may be needed.
Prurigo nodularis manifests as hyperkeratotic nodules, linear excoriations and lichenification, particularly over areas that the patient can reach.  In  this  condition,  patients  may  experience  diffuse  or  focal pruritus.  Rather  than  scratching,  patients  tend  to  'pick',  creating 'picker  nodules' .  Therapy  is  with  topical  or  injectable  steroids  or phototherapy. Nodules may also raise concern for scabies, particularly in  the  patient  with  severe  pruritus.  It  is  important  to  consider  the diagnosis  of  papular  eruption  of  HIV,  where  patients  develop  erythematous papules with urticarial-type erythema. Chronic cases may resemble  prurigo  nodularis.  Recent  reports  have  shown  that  the

pathology  of  these  lesions  may  mimic  insect  bites.  Interestingly, symptoms as well as response to therapy may correspond with the CD4 count in HIV-infected individuals. Finally, when these papules show a necrotic center, the patient is less pruritic, and the diagnosis of  papulonecrotic  tuberculosis  needs  to  be  considered.  Acne-like nodules and papules in a sun-exposed distribution should raise suspicion  for  eosinophilic  folliculitis  which  may  manifest  during  the immune reconstitution syndrome, but may also suggest viral resistance, worsening CD4 counts, or untreated infection altogether.

PRURITUS WITHOUT PRIMARY SKIN LESIONS
In patients who have severe pruritus and minimal primary skin manifestations, it is important to evaluate for underlying causes. The differential diagnosis includes obstructive liver disease, chronic hepatitis, uremia,  hypo-  and  hyperthyroidism,  hematopoietic  diseases,  polycythemia  vera,  lymphoma,  leukemia,  myeloma,  internal  malignancies, intestinal parasites, carcinoid, multiple  sclerosis,  AIDS, medications and neuropsychiatric diseases, especially anorexia nervosa. In a patient presenting with idiopathic pruritus, a thorough physical examination is warranted, along with the following laboratory tests: complete blood count with differential, thyroid-stimulating hormone, liver function tests, renal panel, hepatitis serologies, HIV antibody, urinalysis, stool guaiac, chest x-ray, stool for ova and parasites, and possibly serum protein electrophoresis. While topical steroids can often provide relief for patients who itch due to pruritic skin disorders, if there is an internal cause, the pruritus is often recalcitrant to topical treatments, and a search for correcting the underlying cause becomes even more essential.

HYPOPIGMENTATION/ DEPIGMENTATION
Vitiligo is a common autoimmune disease in the tropics. Caused by selective melanocyte destruction, patients present with depigmented patches that can involve all cutaneous surfaces and hair. Wood's light examination may be useful in distinguishing complete depigmentation  from  hypopigmented  skin,  particularly  if  post-inflammatory hypopigmentation resulting from prior dermatologic disease is suspected.  Seborrheic  dermatitis,  pityriasis  alba,  early  tinea  infections and secondary syphilis may cause such hypopigmentation in skin. It is important to highlight that hypopigmentation may also be seen in so-called 'trichrome' vitiligo, where a transition from normal skin to hypopigmented and then depigmented skin is noted. Unfortunately, the disease is often colloquially confused for leprosy, particularly in Southeast Asia, and affected patients can be subject to discrimination. Attention must also be paid to other systemic autoimmune diseases that may include anemia and thyroid disease.

MORBILLIFORM EXANTHEMS
Individuals with measles develop a morbilliform exanthem, usually in the setting of fever and coryza. For the purpose of this discussion, such  an  exanthem  describes  erythematous,  blanchable  macules, patches,  papules,  and  occasionally  even  plaques,  on  a  hyperemic background. Koplik spots are almost pathognomonic, and manifest in the mouth as white papules with surrounding erythema of sandgrain-like texture. They often precede the rash by 1-2 days. The exanthem starts  in  the  forehead  and  neck,  and  then  generalizes  to  the trunk and extremities. Clinical symptoms such as fever, malaise and coryza are often present. Cases may be difficult to correctly diagnose in those who have previously been vaccinated and present with atypical measles. Unlike its common form, patients with atypical measles lack coryza and Koplik spots, but may present with high fever, pneumonia, hepatitis, edema and paresthesias. In this case, skin lesions may be vesicular, hemorrhagic and urticarial. Clinical prodromes in addition to a morbilliform exanthem may indicate the presence of other viral infections.
Human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis (HME), caused by Ehrlichia chaffeensis ,  human  granulocytotropic  anaplasmosis  (HGA),  caused  by Anaplasma phagocytophilium , and Ehrlichiosis  ewingii infection lead to nonspecific symptoms such as fever, chills, headaches and leukopenia. A macular and papular skin eruption on the trunk and extremities is more common in pediatric patients with these infections than in adults. The cutaneous manifestations often occur after other systemic symptoms arise.
Trench fever, caused by Bartonella quintana , gives rise to a nonspecific morbilliform eruption of the trunk, along with systemic symptoms.

PAPULOSQUAMOUS AND ECZEMATOID LESIONS
Papulosquamous  lesions  are  rashes  that  are  both  raised  and  have scale, such as psoriasis and tinea corporis (Table 8-1). In tineasis, the dermatophytes Microsporum , Trichophyton and Epidermophyton infect keratinized  tissue.  Characteristically,  they  appear  as  erythematous, annular plaques, with serpiginous borders, with scale at the leading edge,  and  are  named  based  on  the  location  of  involvement:  tinea capitis - scalp; tinea corporis - body; tinea faciei - face; tinea cruris -  groin;  tinea  pedis  -  feet;  tinea  manuum  -  hand;  tinea  barbae  beard;  tinea  unguium -  nails. Diagnosis  can  be  confirmed  by  performing a  scraping  of  the  scale  and  applying  one  or  two  drops  of potassium  hydroxide  (KOH)  and  visualizing  the  hyphal  structures under  10 × magnification.  The  differential  diagnosis  includes  other papulosquamous or scaly raised lesions (see Table 8-1). For limited disease, topical antifungals are usually effective, except for tinea capitis and onychomycosis, which often require oral antifungal medications. As  recurrence  is  common,  multiple  courses  of  therapy  are  often required.
Tinea capitis causes circular, scaly patches on the scalp with alopecia and black dots caused by breakage of the hair shaft. Some causative species such as Microsporum audouinii fluoresce on Wood's lamp examination. Favus is a particular type of tinea capitis which causes yellow, concave  cup-shaped  crusts  on  the  scalp  around  loose  hairs  and  is caused by T. schoenleinii . There is a characteristic mousy odor which aids  in  the  diagnosis.  KOH  staining  of  an  affected  hair  shows  air bubbles in the shaft.
Tinea imbricata is a rare form of tinea corporis due to Trichophyton concentricum that  causes  concentric,  polycyclic,  scaly  rings  over  the

Nondermatophyte  superficial  mycosis  includes  tinea  versicolor,  a chronic mildly pruritic scaly discoloration of the upper trunk, arms and neck caused by Malassezia spp. On KOH scraping, a characteristic 'spaghetti and meatball' pattern is seen, corresponding to the short thick hyphae and spores. Even after treatment and cure, the hypopigmentation may persist for months.
Tinea nigra, caused by Hortaea werneckii or Stenella araguat , is found primarily in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America. Clinically, it causes a solitary, asymptomatic, light brown macule, often on the palm, that darkens and grows. Though confused with melanoma, this lesion  will  scrape  off,  and  can  be  confirmed  with  KOH  staining. Topical azoles or keratolytics can be used for treatment.

PAPULOSQUAMOUS AND ECZEMATOID LESIONS
Black piedra, caused by the astromycete Piedraia hortae , is found primarily in Africa, Asia and Latin America. It causes black, hard, fixed nodules attached to the hair. White piedra is most commonly caused by Trichosporon beigelii , and manifests as yellow or beige soft sheaths coating hair shafts. Treatment for black and white piedra consists of a short haircut, although antifungals can also be used.
Candida is a commensal inhabitant of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts, but is also a pathogen which grows during conditions of warmth, moisture and increased pH. Thrush, or oral candidiasis, manifests as grayish-white plaques in the mouth that scrape off. Perlèche is candida-associated erythematous scaling at the angles of the oral commissure that can mimic some nutritional deficiencies. Candidiasis often affects the perianal region, inguinal folds and inframammary areas, and manifests as beefy red erythema with satellite lesions and occasional pustules. Antibiotics and immunosuppression predispose to candidiasis.
M. leprae usually  affects  skin  on  the  extremities,  which  is  cooler  in temperature, while sparing warmer areas of the body, including the axilla and scalp. There is a wide range of  disease, from the limited tuberculoid type to the diffuse lepromatous type of leprosy (Hansen's disease).  In  tuberculoid  leprosy,  there  are  well-demarcated  solitary, hypopigmented  plaques  with  raised  borders  and  slight  scale.  The hypoesthesia, absence of hair and lack of sweating within the lesions is very characteristic. In lepromatous leprosy, owing to an absence of cell-mediated immunity, there are numerous small hypopigmented or  erythematous  macules  that  are  ill-defined.  Loss  of  the  lateral eyebrow,  leonine  facies,  madarosis,  glove-and-stocking  neuropathy, claw-finger  and  toe  deformities  are  late  manifestations.  Borderline lesions exist between the continuum of tuberculoid and lepromatous leprosy.

PAPULOSQUAMOUS AND ECZEMATOID LESIONS
Other diseases that cause hypopigmentation include pityriasis alba,  post-inflammatory  hypopigmentation  and  tinea  versicolor. Tinea  versicolor  also  causes  a  hypopigmented  scaly  thin  plaque (Fig. 8.5). A Wood's lamp can be helpful in demonstrating that the lesions  in  leprosy  and  tinea  are  hypopigmented  and  not  depigmented as in vitiligo. The differential diagnosis also includes papulosquamous disorders such as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, pityriasis rosea,  para-psoriasis,  lupus  erythematosus,  sarcoidosis  and  secondary syphilis.
Lyme disease is caused by Borrelia  burgdorferi, transmitted  by Ixodes hard ticks. Erythema chronicum migrans (ECM) manifests as a bull'seye  lesion  of  a  gradually  expanding,  non-scaly  redness  around  the initial  tick  bite.  Headache,  stiff  neck,  myalgia  and  arthralgias  may accompany the characteristic rash. Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans,  lymphocytoma  and  lichen  sclerosus  have  all been  associated with chronic Lyme disease.
Syphilis, caused by Treponema pallidum , can be divided into three main stages. During primary syphilis, a painless round, indurated chancre forms, which may form on extragenital sites, such as within the oral cavity, in addition to the genitalia. Secondary syphilis may manifest as  a  nonspecific  maculopapular  or,  less  commonly,  a  papulosquamous eruption, classically with involvement of the palms and soles.
FIGURE  8.5 Tinea  versicolor.  This  chronic  disease  is  characterized  by macules and thin patches and plaques with subtle scale. The term versicolor refers to the changing coloration of lesions, often appearing lighter than surrounding tan skin in the summer, but darker than sun-protected skin during colder months.
Tertiary, late-stage syphilis may manifest as noduloulcerative lesions consisting of reddish-brown firm nodules.

HTLV-1 infection may be associated with a number of dermatologic conditions.  HTLV-1  infection  is  most  frequently  recognized  in  the Caribbean, and areas of Asia and Latin America, and in the latter is most frequently reported among Amerindian populations. Patients may present with recalcitrant eczematoid dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis  and  blepharitis.  The  diagnosis  is usually  made  after  several attempts at controlling the eruption with topical steroids or immunomodulators. In adults, dermatologic disease may be a presenting manifestation of adult T-cell leukemia. Affected patients present with disseminated papules that coalesce into plaques and nodules, with striking  infiltrative  morphology.  Patients  also  have  systemic  symptoms and the systemic evidence of acute T-cell leukemia, including hepatosplenomegaly, systemic lymphadenopathy and central nervous system involvement. Affected patients will exhibit circulating leukemic cells, termed 'flower cells' or 'ATL cells' . The disease is often fatal, but smoldering forms, chronic disease and lymphoma-type disease have also been reported.

============================================================
ERYTHRODERMA
Correctly  diagnosing  the  cause  of  diffuse  erythroderma  or  wholebody erythema presents a unique challenge to the physician. These patients may present with marked systemic symptoms, and can suffer severe morbidity from lack of epidermal barrier function, including dehydration,  infection  and  severe  pain.  Ectropion  may  be  seen. Diffuse erythema can lead to severe imbalances of electrolytes and minerals,  and  hypocalcemic  tetany  can  occur.  As  the  eruption improves,  generalized  exfoliation  is  the  norm.  The  evaluation  of patients with erythroderma often requires histopathologic evaluation, to exclude full-thickness epidermal necrosis, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). TEN is commonly caused by a drug, but infectious etiologies have also been implicated, particularly mycoplasma and herpetic infections.
Erythroderma may be caused by severe drug reactions. The presence of small, superficial pustules may indicate exanthematous generalized pustular dermatosis (AGEP), most commonly caused by β -lactam and cephalosporin antibiotics. Patients  present with fever and can have peripheral blood leukocytosis, commonly prompting evaluation for an  infectious  disease.  A  similar  finding  may  be  noted  in  pustular psoriasis, which may occur in patients with no prior history of psoriasis. Though nail findings may be helpful in those with prior history, such findings may not be seen in those with an acute, first episode. Patients appear ill and are often hospitalized. Cultures of the pustules

fail to indicate a superficial cutaneous infection, though ectopic infection  such  as  streptococcal  pharyngitis  may  precipitate  an  attack. Though  oral  steroids  may  improve  symptoms,  upon  withdrawal, disease can re-flare.

ERYTHRODERMA
Pityriasis rubra pilaris, a close relative of psoriasis, may also be the cause of erythroderma. Patients often have conspicuous 'islands of sparing', where seemingly normal skin is noted among erythrodermic skin. Hyperlinearity may be seen in palms and soles, in addition to a salmon-colored, sand-papered type of scale with sharp demarcation along transgrediens lines (the line boundary between cutaneous skin and the sole of the foot, for instance).
Other important diagnoses to consider include atopic dermatitis, viral exanthems, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, which in the leukemic phase is termed Sé zary syndrome, the staphylococcal skin scalded syndrome, as well as toxic shock syndrome. In HIV-positive individuals or those with other immunosuppressing disorders, seborrheic dermatitis may lead to erythroderma. Uncommonly, systemic malignancies such as colon and lung carcinoma, as well as lymphoma and leukemia, can also be culprits. In those who have had a bone marrow transplant, erythroderma may be a result of graft-versus-host disease. Red man syndrome indicates a state of erythroderma where no clear culprit can be ascertained.

ICTHYOSIS
Fish-like scaling on cutaneous surfaces (ichthyosis) may be seen in a variety  of  conditions,  both  congenital  and  acquired.  Disease  may range  from  limited  and  asymptomatic,  to  disseminated  and  lifethreatening.  Most  commonly, ichthyosis vulgaris is  inherited  in  an autosomal dominant fashion, and develops as scaling over relatively uninflamed skin. Usually, antecubital fossae are spared. Scales may become hyperpigmented and feel tightly adherent to underlying skin (Fig. 8.6). It may be coincident with atopic dermatitis or its associated findings, such as the follicularly based, spiny, hyperkeratotic papules of  keratosis  pilaris  over  the  upper  extremities  and  thighs.  Though ichthyosis may be the presenting sign of a lymphoma, it is found most commonly in the general population and may go unnoticed. Congenital ichthyoses include lamellar disease, which is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Ectropion and alopecia may be a distinguishing feature. The scale is often likened to 'reptile skin' . Though it can be seen in adults, patients readily exhibit disease in their early years, even at birth. X-linked ichthyosis presents as adherent fish-like scaling, usually hyperpigmented and giving an impression of 'dirty skin' .

SERPIGINOUS LESIONS
Cutaneous  larva  migrans  is  caused  by  zoonotic  hookworms.  Also referred to as 'creeping eruption', the primary lesion is a serpiginous, slightly swollen, erythematous lesion that may induce local urticaria
FIGURE 8.7 Cutaneous larva migrans. The key to the diagnosis is to identify a  serpiginous  lesion  that  is  not  static.  The  patient  will  report  intense pruritus and a changing lesion, both in shape and location.
(Fig. 8.7). Infection is acquired cutaneously, most often from dog or cat hookworms ( Ancylostoma braziliense ). Interestingly, the advancing edge of the lesion does not accurately represent the body of the hookworm, bur rather the inflammatory reaction that trails it. Usually, the hookworm has advanced beyond the visible serpiginous border, so destructive  therapies  such  as  cryotherapy  applied  to  the  advancing edge may miss the hookworm altogether. If such treatments are performed, therapy should aim about 1 cm ahead of the advancing edge. Notably, the hookworms causing cutaneous larva migrans lack collagenase and are therefore restricted to the squamous epithelium in skin and are only rarely found in the dermis due to the presence of collagen IV in the basement membrane separating dermis from epidermis. This is in contrast to larva currens, which represents cutaneous transit of infective strongyloides larvae before entering the systemic circulation. Disseminated or hyperinfectious strongyloidiasis may be associated with sepsis, petechiae and purpura fulminans.

EDEMA
Lymphatic  filariasis  is  associated  with  lymphangitis,  and  recurrent and  worsening  episodes  of  lymphedema.  Lymphedema  is  due  to impedance in lymphatic flow, or outright lymphatic channel destruction. Lichenification, fissuring and scaling can be seen in longstanding infections. End-stage disease can be mistaken for elephantiasis verrucosa nostra from chronic stasis dermatitis, as well as podoconiosis, the latter caused by lymphatic obstruction secondary to silica-laden volcanic ash. Unilateral chronic extremity edema should prompt consideration of filariasis or a unilateral obstructing mass in the draining lymph nodes. Other important clues to the diagnosis of lymphatic filariasis include testicular hydrocele and lymphadenopathy.
Loiasis is a filarial infection in which the adult Loa loa worm migrates in  subcutaneous  tissue  and  across  the  conjunctiva  ('eye  worm'). Localized  edema  from  a  hypersensitivity  reaction  can  occur  over joints and bony prominences as the worm passes, so-called Calabar swellings. Peripheral eosinophilia is prominent. Compared  to lymphatic filariasis, loaiasis-associated edema is transient and migratory.
Onchocerca  volvulus ,  the  causative  organism  of  onchocerciasis  (river blindness), is another filarial infection that often first manifests in the skin. Microfilariae are produced by adult worms that reside in subcutaneous nodules, so-called onchocermata. Microfilariae migrate freely through  subcutaneous  and  ocular  structures.  Dying  microfilariae provoke an intense inflammatory response, leading to pruritus and excoriations, and a diffuse papular dermatitis. Papules and plaques can  be  seen  with  overlying  lichenified  streaks  indicating  chronic scratching and rubbing by afflicted patients. Scabetic infection may enter the differential diagnosis, but linear burrows along interdigital

web spaces, genital involvement, and evidence of the causative mite on a mineral oil preparation can usually readily diagnose the latter condition. Of note, hyperpigmentation is not a distinguishing feature in differentiating among these diseases, as chronic infection in both may  lead to atopic dermatitis-like disease and patchy  hypo/ hyperpigmentation.  Plate-like  ichthyosis  over  leathery  skin  with hypo/hyperpigmentation,  commonly  referred  to  as  leopard  skin, would point to the diagnosis of chronic onchocerciasis. Loss of elasticity of skin can lead to 'hanging groin' .
Trichinosis can also be the cause of edema, though in this case, periorbital, nondependent edema is most commonly noted. Other dermatologic findings may include a hypersensitivity-like petechial rash, xerosis and subconjunctival hemorrhage.
American trypanosomiasis can be difficult to diagnose acutely given its  nonspecific  systemic  and  dermatologic  manifestations.  Distinguishing features  of acute disease include the so-called 'chagoma', where the protozoal inoculum causes subcutaneous swelling, induration and erythema accompanied by local lymphadenopathy. When the eye is the portal of entry, Romañ a's sign may develop, comprised of  unilateral, painless, periorbital edema and conjunctival swelling. African trypanosomiasis also includes skin manifestations. A chancre can develop at the site of a bite from an infecting tsetse fly. The lesion can  rapidly  enlarge  and  ulcerate,  and  can  be  associated  with  local lymphadenopathy.
