Key features
- The clinical presentation of uncomplicated malaria is a nonspeci/c, undi.erentiated febrile illness. It is not possible to con/rm or exclude the diagnosis of malaria based on clinical presentation alone
- Malaria infection in non-immune individuals is a medical emergency
- Malaria infection is not synonymous with malaria illness, particularly in malaria-endemic areas where older children and adults have acquired immunity to malaria disease and are commonly found with asymptomatic parasitemias
- The diagnosis of malaria should be parasitologically con/rmed by the microscopic visualization of parasites on a peripheral blood smear or detecting parasite antigen with a rapid diagnostic test (RDT)
- Repeating smears every 12 hours for 36-48 hours if initial smears are negative is warranted in non-immune individuals who are at risk. It not necessary to time smears with elevations in temperature to make a parasitologic diagnosis
- Patients who are unable to take anti-malarial medication by mouth require parenteral therapy - a loading dose is essential
- When possible, decisions regarding the use of anti-malarial medications should be based on parasitologic evidence (blood /lm or malaria RDT)

INTRODUCTION
Malaria is an ancient and enduring scourge of mankind with a rich and fascinating history [1]. About 3 billion people - nearly half of the world's population - are at risk of malaria infection and illness. Every year, this leads to about 250 million malaria cases and nearly 1  million malaria deaths.  Malaria  has shaped  the human genome, complicated major military campaigns, eluded pharmacologic attacks, adversely  affected  international  economic  indicators  and  frustrated generations of clinicians, scientists and policy makers.
Malaria is an acute and chronic disease caused by obligate intracellular protozoa of the genus Plasmodium . Historically, four species of malaria parasites were considered capable of infecting humans: Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium malariae; however, recently, a fifth Plasmodium knowlesi - has been recognized as a significant human pathogen [2]. The majority (56%) of malaria infections are in sub-Saharan Africa, followed by Southeast Asia (27%), the Eastern Mediterranean (12%) and South America (3%) [3]. The parasites are transmitted to humans by female Anopheles mosquitos. The clinical presentation is highly variable but is  generally  characterized by an undifferentiated febrile illness with headache,  chills  and  rigors,  anemia  and  splenomegaly. Plasmodium falciparum is the species most commonly associated with severe and complicated disease.
Plasmodium vivax is the dominant species found outside of Africa; its distribution (the Middle East, Asia, the Western Pacific and Central and  South  America)  complements  that  of P.  ovale (primarily  West Africa). Plasmodium malariae has a worldwide distribution, generally in  isolated  pockets,  and,  to  date, P.  knowlesi is  restricted  to  South and Southeast Asia, primarily in areas harboring macaque monkeys (Fig. 96.1).

INTRODUCTION
In sub-Saharan Africa, nearly all of the malaria-associated morbidity and mortality is caused by P. falciparum . Individuals of all ages remain susceptible to infection, but immunity to severe disease develops over time, the result of repeated exposure to bites from infected anopheline mosquitoes. Anti-disease immunity is related to transmission intensity,  but  its  specific  characteristics  and  determinants  are  not  well understood. Non-immune individuals - typically young children in sub-Saharan Africa, but tourists and soldiers in other malaria-endemic areas are included in this category - are at risk of developing severe and complicated malaria. Semi-immune people can be infected (i.e. parasitemic)  but  asymptomatic;  when  semi-immune  people  do develop a malaria illness, it is generally marked by fever and malaise and rarely becomes life-threatening.
There is a broad geographic overlap between the distributions of HIV and malaria, especially falciparum malaria. Co-infection is associated with a transient increase in HIV RNA [4]. HIV-infected individuals, particularly those with CD4 counts < 200 cells/ μ l, are more susceptible to  malaria  infection  and  have  higher  parasitemias  [5].  Data  on whether HIV serostatus has any impact on malaria disease severity are conflicting.
Contemporary efforts to address the multiple challenges of malaria control, prevention and, perhaps, elimination (reduction to zero of malaria infection in a defined geographic area) or eradication (permanent  extinction  of  malaria  transmission  throughout  the  world) include  using  combination  chemotherapy exclusively (to  slow  the development and spread of drug resistant parasites) , attempting to develop  a  malaria  vaccine  and  scaling-up  interventions  which  are known to be effective (e.g. long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets, indoor residual spraying of insecticide).

TRANSMISSION
The  epidemiology  of  malaria  is  fundamentally  determined  by  the dynamics and intensity of parasite transmission. Vector abundance and longevity are major contributors to transmission rates and these are  strongly  influenced  by  temperature,  rainfall  and  humidity.  The most  direct  measure  of  transmission  intensity  is  the  entomologic inoculation rate (EIR) - the number of infectious female anopheline bites per person per year. In general, EIRs of < 10/year are considered 'low  transmission',  10-49/year  'intermediate  transmission'  and

> 50/year  'high  transmission' .  For  clinicians  working  in  settings where  data  on  EIRs  are  not  readily  available,  surrogate  measures include the spleen rate and parasite prevalence rates in children (Box 96.1). Transmission dynamics are regarded as stable when transmission is constant throughout the year, or predictably seasonal. Unstable transmission (characteristic of epidemics) occurs when there are changes in the environment (e.g. sudden, heavy rains) or in the population (e.g. migration).

============================================================

============================================================
TRANSMISSION
Malaria transmission is also influenced by climate. The optimal conditions occur when the temperature is between 20°C and 30°C and the mean relative humidity is at least 60%. Sporogony does not occur at temperatures below 16°C or higher than 33°C. Water temperatures regulate the duration of the aquatic cycle of the mosquito vector. A high  relative  humidity  increases  mosquito  longevity  and  therefore increases the probability that an infected mosquito will survive long enough to become infective.
The proximity of human habitation to breeding sites directly influences vector-human contact and, therefore, transmission. The stability of breeding sites is influenced by water supply, soil and vegetation.
Irrigation schemes, dams and other man-made changes affecting land use can radically alter stable patterns of malaria transmission.

============================================================
ACQUIRED IMMUNITY
The incidence and prevalence of malaria illness is determined largely by acquired immunity. The burden of disease and death is borne by non-immune individuals. In areas of stable transmission (e.g. most of sub-Saharan Africa), young children are the non-immune individuals at risk of life-threatening malaria. Older children and adults are 'semi-immune';  their  malaria  infections  may  be  asymptomatic  or they may develop uncomplicated malaria illnesses.
Attributing a cause-and-effect relationship between parasites and the often nonspecific symptoms of an uncomplicated malaria illness in semi-immune  patients  is  difficult  and  bedevils  the  diagnosis  of  a 'malaria illness' in this group (see ' Interpreting the results of malaria diagnostic tests ' below).
Where transmission is unstable, there is little acquired immunity and individuals from all age groups can develop severe disease. Whether

- Pre-patent period: the  time from inoculation of sporozoites from mosquitoes until asexual erythrocytic stage parasites are detected by microscopy in the bloodstream. This measure can be inRuenced by the parasite detection technique (PCR > rapid diagnostic tests > microscopy).
- Incubation period: the time from inoculation of sporozoites from mosquitoes until an individual develops clinical signs or symptoms  of  malaria  -  this  is  always  longer  than  the  prepatent  period,  but  the  time  diSerence  is  determined  by immune status.  Non-immune  individuals  develop symptoms with low parasitemias, so the incubation period is shorter than in semi-immune individuals, who may be able to tolerate signiQcant parasitemias without becoming symptomatic.
- Recurrence: repeat intra-erythrocytic infection causing malaria-associated symptoms.
- Relapse: a  recurrent  infection  caused  by  a  new  brood  of blood-stage  parasites  emerging  from  hypnozoites  in  the liver ( P. vivax, P. ovale) .
- Recrudescence: a recurrent infection caused by the growth of  an  undetectable  blood  stage  infection  (generally  the result  of  drug  resistance,  unusual  pharmacokinetics  or  an incomplete dose). It can also occur in immunocompromised individuals, most famously with P. malariae.

INNATE IMMUNITY
On a population level, several genetic polymorphisms and mutations conferring risk or protection have been identified; most involve mutations  in  the  alpha  or  beta  chain  of  hemoglobin  (hemoglobinopathies), such  as sickle cell anemia  and  trait, the thalassemias, hemoglobin C, red blood cell enzyme deficiencies, such as glucose 6 phosphate  deficiency  (G6PD),  or  mutations  affecting  the  red  cell exoskeleton,  such  as  ovalocytosis.  Individuals  with  sickle  cell  trait (HbAS) are less likely to develop severe malaria once infected than are individuals who are homozygous (HbAA). Practically speaking, information  on  genetic  polymorphisms  is  rarely  available  quickly enough to be useful  during  an  acute  illness;  it  may  be  potentially useful  when  considering  risks  associated  with  travel  to  malariaendemic  areas  and  it  provides  some  insight  into  mechanisms  of disease pathogenesis, susceptibility and protection.

NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
Malaria is usually transmitted during the bite of an infected female Anopheles mosquito or, more rarely, through the direct inoculation of infected red blood cells (i.e. congenital malaria, transfusion malaria and malaria from contaminated needles).

LIFECYCLE
Infection begins when sporozoites in mosquito saliva enter the bloodstream and, within 30 minutes, have invaded hepatocytes (Fig 96.2).
- description of the relationship between parasite transmission and malaria disease in a given setting (Table 96-6).
- Stable  malaria is  present  when  natural  transmission  occurs over many years and there is a predictable incidence of illness and prevalence of infection. Transmission is generally high and epidemics are unlikely.
- Unstable malaria occurs in settings where transmission rates vary  from  year  to  year  and  population  immunity is  low.  Epidemics are more likely in this setting.
- Autochthonous  (indigenous)  malaria is  contracted  locally. Secondary cases are those derived from imported cases and are referred to as introduced malaria .
- Induced  malaria is  acquired  by  blood  transfusion,  shared needles, intentional inoculation, or laboratory accident.
- Cryptic malaria cases are those that occur in isolation and are not associated with secondary cases.
- Imported malaria infections  are  associated  with  individuals returning from malaria-endemic areas. Increased international air  travel  has  escalated  the  incidence  of imported  malaria (and other infectious diseases) to non-endemic areas. Tourists often travel during the incubation period and do not become ill until after they return home.
- Entomologic inoculation rate: sporozoite positive mosquito bites per unit time.
- Annual  parasite  incidence  (API): number  of  new  parasite conQrmed cases per 1000 population.
- Spleen rate: proportion of individuals in  a stated age range with enlarged spleens.
The duration of the asexual replication phase inside the hepatocytes varies from 1 1-12 days in P.  falciparum, P. vivax and P.  ovale ,  to  35 days in P. malariae (Table 96-1). The nucleus undergoes repeated division,  resulting  in  the  formation  of  thousands  of  uninucleate merozoites, each  measuring 0.7-1.8 μ m in diameter. The nucleus of the liver cell  is  displaced,  but  there is  no inflammatory reaction in the surrounding liver tissue, and the host is asymptomatic.

In P. falciparum and P. malariae infections, the liver tissue schizonts/ meronts rupture at about the same time and none persists in the liver. In  contrast, P.  vivax and P.  ovale have  two  types  of  exoerythrocytic forms:  a  primary  type  develops  and  ruptures  within  6-9  days;  the secondary type - the hypnozoite - may remain dormant in the liver for weeks, months, or up to 5 years before developing, and causing relapses of  erythrocytic  infection  unless  the  patient  is  treated  with primaquine - a drug that targets this lifecycle stage. The pre-patent period for P. knowlesi in humans has not yet been determined. Most infected hepatocytes rupture when the schizont forms mature and the merozoites that are released into the circulation quickly attach to, and invade, red blood cells.
Plasmodium falciparum and P. knowlesi are capable of invading erythrocytes of any age, but P. vivax and P. ovale selectively invade reticulocytes.  Serial  cycles  of  asexual  replication  take  place  in  erythrocytes and,  again,  the  duration  varies  with  the  species,  ranging  from  24 hours in P. knowlesi to 48 hours in P. falciparum, P. vivax and P. ovale , and 72 hours in P. malariae (Table 96-1).
The  youngest  stages in  the  blood  are  small,  rounded  trophozoites, known as ring forms. As they grow, they become more irregular and ameboid. During development, the parasites consume hemoglobin leaving an iron-containing compound known as hematin or hemozoin as the product of digestion; it is visible in the cytoplasm of the parasite as dark granules. The schizont/meront stage begins when the

In response to a variety of stimuli, some parasites undergo gametocytogenesis. When male and female gametes are ingested by a female anopheline taking a blood meal from a human host, the sexual replication phase of the malaria parasite ensues, starting in the mosquito mid-gut and ending in the salivary glands. The erythrocytic lifecycle continues until it is abrogated by effective chemotherapy or reined in by the host's acquired immunity.
The  life  cycle  of P.  falciparum differs  from  the  other  four  human malaria parasites in one important respect: during the latter half of the  intra-erythrocytic  cycle,  mature  falciparum-infected  red  blood cells  (schizonts)  effectively  disappear  from  the  peripheral  blood.
These late-stage parasites are very active metabolically, consuming up to  75  times  more  glucose  than  earlier  ring  stages  and  generating lactate as an end product. At this stage, the red cell surface is studded with  'knobs'  (proteins  of  parasite  origin)  and  these  mediate  the cytoadherence  of  parasitized  red  cells  to  receptors  on  the  luminal surface of endothelial cells. This leads to sequestration of the parasitized red cells in various organs (brain, gut, subcutaneous fat, cardiac muscle), particularly in capillaries and post-capillary venules, in such large numbers that blood flow is impaired [7] (Fig. 96.3).
The 'natural history' of malaria infection and illness is  difficult to capture. In its early stages, a malaria illness is indistinguishable from other common causes of fever. In endemic areas, and for returning travelers,  if  malaria  infections  are  identified  as  such  and  treated

If the initial symptoms are not attributed to malaria, 'tertiary care' may not be sought  until  complications  (commonly  coma  and  convulsions) develop.

PATHOGENESIS
Pathophysiologic changes in malaria are caused by a number of different parasite-derived stimuli involving many different organ systems. Blood-stage parasites  are  the  main  source  of  these  various  stimuli; exoerythrocytic  stages,  gametocytes  and  sporozoites  do  not  induce pathophysiologic changes. Malaria pathogenesis and pathology  are linked inextricably to stages in the lifecycle (Fig. 96.2).

Fever
Schizont  rupture  is  the  likely  source  of  the  fevers  associated  with malaria, although the specific pyrogens have yet to be identified. The fevers are rarely as periodic as the erythrocytic cycles themselves, probably  because  parasite  population  dynamics  within  a  host  are  not synchronous.

Anemia
Malarial  anemia  results  largely  from  the  hemolysis  of  infected  red blood  cells  at  the  time  of  schizont  rupture,  accelerated  immunemediated  destruction  of  uninfected  red  blood  cells,  bone  marrow suppression  and  dyserythropoiesis,  despite  appropriate  concentrations of erythropoietin.

Because of its deleterious effects on the central nervous system (CNS), and because of the necessity for treatment with exogenous glucose, this is the most important of the biochemical aberrations described to date [8]. Hypoglycemia (usually defined as blood glucose concentrations < 40 mg/dL or 2.2 mmol/L) can develop, prior to any antimalarial treatment, in up to 20% of children with severe P. falciparum malaria. Plasma insulin levels are low and gluconeogenic precursors and  adrenal  hormones  are  present  in  high  concentrations  in  the blood, so parasite consumption of glucose and/or inadequate hepatic gluconeogenesis  are  the  most  likely  etiologies  for  pretreatment  of hypoglycemia. It is not possible to detect hypoglycemia on clinical

Unconscious patients who present with pretreatment hypoglycemia have a worse prognosis than those who do not, and the risk of a poor outcome is inversely associated with blood glucose concentrations, even those above the traditional cutoff of 2.2 mmol/L (40 mg/dL) [8]. Anti-malarial treatment  can  precipitate  hypoglycemia.  Rapid  infusions  of  quinine ( > 10 mg/kg/hr) can stimulate pancreatic insulin secretion; pregnant women appear to be especially susceptible to this complication  of treatment.

Metabolic acidosis
Acidosis  is  now  recognized  as  an  important  marker  of  severity  in falciparum malaria infections. 'Acidotic breathing' alone was associated with a 19% mortality rate in Kenyan children. In this population, the mortality rate in children with impaired consciousness uncomplicated by acidotic breathing was 12%; in children with acidotic breathing  and  impaired  consciousness,  the  mortality  rate  was  32%  [8] (Fig.  96.4).  Elevated  plasma  and  cerebrospinal  fluid  (CSF)  lactate levels are also associated with a poor outcome but few studies have examined both pH and lactate, so although they are likely to be highly correlated,  the  precise  relationship  is  not  known.  Acidosis  and hypoglycemia are strongly associated, suggesting parasite and/or host metabolism  may  be  contributing  to  both.  Full-blown  circulatory shock is rarely a feature of severe and complicated malaria, so grossly impaired perfusion is unlikely to be a cause of the metabolic acidosis of malaria. This acidosis generally improves rapidly once intravenous (IV) treatment with an effective anti-malarial drug and maintenance fluids is started. The transient nature of the acidosis is consistent with the possibility that seizures are a contributing factor. Convulsions are common in  malaria,  and  seizures  alone  can  cause  an  acute  lactic acidosis. Acidosis persists longer in those patients who die and is also associated with a slower respiratory rate; this suggests that the usual centrally-mediated respiratory response to metabolic acidosis may be compromised in these patients.

Nonspecific mildly elevated urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, proteinuria  and  abnormal  urinary  sediment  are  common  in  malaria. Acute renal failure is a common complication of severe malaria, particularly in adults. As in cerebral malaria, the insult often resolves and most patients do not require long-term dialysis [10].

============================================================
CHUNK 24
============================================================
Neurologic changes and coma
The  clinical  syndrome  of  cerebral  malaria  is  associated  with  the sequestration of erythrocytes harboring late-stage P. falciparum parasites  (trophozoites  and  schizonts)  in  the  cerebral  microcirculation. Putative mechanisms include obstruction leading to hypoperfusion with  anoxic  damage,  endothelial  cell  activation  and  blood-brain barrier compromise, and platelet activation with microthrombus formation (Fig. 96.3). Alternatively, a cytokine cascade leading to a systemic inflammatory response-type scenario, initiated by the interaction of parasitized red cells and host immune cells has been postulated; this mechanism would be independent of sequestration and could be invoked  for  the  other  four  species  of  malaria  parasite  involved  in human disease [1 1].

============================================================
CHUNK 25
============================================================
PRODROMAL SYMPTOMS
Some  patients  have  vague  prodromal  symptoms,  such  as  malaise, myalgia, low back pain,  headache, anorexia  and mild  fever,  before parasitemia  can  be  detected  by  the  usual  microscopic  techniques. These manifestations may persist for 2-3 days before an acute paroxysm begins. The incubation period, or time from exposure to onset of  symptoms,  can  be  prolonged  by  partial  immunity  and/or  by chemoprophylaxis.

============================================================
CHUNK 26
============================================================
PERIODICITY
In  primary  attacks,  several  days  are  required  before  the  periodicity predicted by the lengths of various parasite lifecycles is established. Often, in patients with 'asynchronous' infections, this periodicity is never clinically apparent. After 5-7 days, P. vivax, P. malariae and P. ovale infections can become synchronous and cause periodic febrile paroxysms. In P. vivax and P. falciparum malaria, schizonts mature and rupture with tertian periodicity, i.e. every 48 hours; P.  vivax malaria has been referred to as benign tertian malaria and P. falciparum malaria as malignant tertian malaria. Plasmodium malariae schizonts rupture at 72-hour intervals, causing a quartan periodicity. The typical paroxysm has an abrupt onset with a feeling of coldness and a chill. The patient's teeth may chatter prompting the need for warmth or cover. Within 30-60 minutes, the patient feels hot and has profuse sweating, usually accompanied by a headache, malaise and myalgia. Temperatures of 40-41°C (104-106°F) are usual in primary falciparum infections, but peak fevers in infections with the other three species of plasmodia are usually lower, i.e. 39-40°C (102-104°F). The hot stage lasts from 2-6 hours.  The  sweating  stage,  in  which  the  patient's  temperature  falls rapidly, lasts 2-3 hours. The entire paroxysm averages 9-10 hours. In between paroxysms, the patient may feel well.

============================================================
CHUNK 27
============================================================
UNCOMPLICATED MALARIA
Uncomplicated malaria illness  is  by  far the  most  common  clinical manifestation of a malaria infection and fever, or history of fever, is the most common symptom. There are no pathognomonic signs by which 'uncomplicated malaria' can be distinguished from common viral causes  of  fever  (Box  96.2).  The  presence  of  malaria  parasitemia increases the odds of a causal connection, especially in non-immune individuals, where peripheral parasitemia is nearly always associated with symptoms. Many semi-immune individuals (generally long-term residents  of  malaria-endemic  areas)  can  harbor  parasites  without becoming symptomatic and, in these individuals, peripheral blood parasitemia may well be 'incidental' to the symptoms [12]. In practical terms, symptomatic, parasitemic individuals who are alert enough to take oral medications are considered to have 'uncomplicated malaria' .
Important  aspects  of  the  clinical  history  include  travel  itinerary, malaria precautions (chemoprophylaxis, use of bed nets and repellents) and recent prior treatment with anti-malarial drugs. The physical exam is useful for identifying other potential etiologies. In endemic areas,  the  presence  of  hepato-  or  splenomegaly  tilt  the  differential diagnosis  toward  malaria,  as  does  thrombocytopenia.  For  nonimmune travelers, the presence of fever, splenomegaly, hyperbilirubinemia and thrombocytopenia make malaria more likely [13].
Common presenting signs are generalized constitutional symptoms including  fever,  chills,  dizziness,  backache,  myalgia,  malaise  and fatigue (frequently summarized as 'total body pain' by endemic-area adults). Gastrointestinal symptoms (i.e. anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea) can be prominent, causing confusion with  gastroenteritis.  Patients  may  have  nonproductive  cough  and dyspnea, consistent with acute respiratory infections. Young children and semi-immune adults may present with only fever and headache.

============================================================
CHUNK 28
============================================================
LABORATORY FINDINGS
Anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are usual. The reticulocyte count is normal or depressed, despite the hemolysis, and becomes elevated usually 5-7 days after the parasitemia has cleared. Urinalysis reveals albuminuria and urobilinogen; increased conjugated bilirubin is  present  in  many  patients.  Some  patients  are jaundiced and  concomitant abnormalities in liver function tests may cause diagnostic confusion with viral hepatitis. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), are usually elevated. Both the direct and the indirect bilirubin can be elevated. Prothrombin times can be prolonged. Hyponatremia is not uncommon; in some patients, the clinical picture is consistent with inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), but this is not a universal finding. Increases in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen may be transient, or they may presage acute renal failure. Hypoglycemia frequently complicates falciparum  malaria  and  can  occur  both  before  treatment  and  as  a result of quinine therapy.
The five human malaria parasites have similar clinical presentations for uncomplicated disease and are best distinguished from each other

COMPLICATED MALARIA
Long considered to be unique to falciparum malaria, several of the features of complicated malaria (Table 96-2) have now been described in patients with P. vivax and P. knowlesi infections. In addition to the complications described in Table 96-2, splenic rupture is a rare complication of P. vivax infections, and nephrotic syndrome is occasionally seen in patients after a P. malariae illness.
In a parasitemic patient, the presence of any of the clinical or laboratory  features  of  complicated  malaria  represents  a  medical  emergency;  these  patients  should  be  provided  with  the  best  available medical care.
The clinical presentation of complicated malaria is different in adults than it  is  in  children  (Table  96-2).  Cerebral  malaria alone  is more characteristic of pediatric severe malaria, whereas multi-organ system involvement is seen frequently  in  adults  with  complicated  malaria illnesses.
Cerebral malaria is a highly variable clinical syndrome consisting of P.  falciparum parasitemia of any density and coma (Blantyre Coma Score < 2 in children/Glasgow Coma Score < 9 in adults, unrelated to hypoglycemia, meningitis or a postictal state). Children with cerebral malaria  frequently  demonstrate  symptoms  suggesting  widespread involvement of the CNS, including generalized tonic-clonic convulsions,  focal  seizures,  posturing  (opisthotonos,  decerebrate  rigidity, decorticate rigidity), conjugate gaze deviations and respiratory rhythm abnormalities  (including  Cheyne-Stokes  respirations).  Convulsions (focal  and  generalized)  are  very  common,  particularly  in  children. Intracranial pressure is often elevated in children with cerebral malaria and deaths consistent with various herniation syndromes have been described. An unusual feature of pediatric malarial comas is that the eyes are frequently wide open (Fig. 96.5) - this can be confusing for parents and caregivers. Among patients who survive, the recovery is
FIGURE 96.5 Child in coma with eyes wide open.
FIGURE 96.6 Pallor.
relatively  rapid;  most  children  who  survive  an  episode  of  cerebral malaria have regained full consciousness within 48 hours. The rapid evolution and reversibility of the dramatic neurologic features of cerebral malaria are among the most intriguing aspects of the disease.
The clinical history is generally notable for a sudden deterioration in the patient's  clinical  status  -  the  transition  from  uncomplicated  to complicated malaria can be as brief as a single seizure.

CHUNK 33
============================================================
COMPLICATED MALARIA
With  point-of-care  bedside  tests  for  malaria  parasitemia,  blood glucose,  hemoglobin  or  hematocrit  and  lactate  combined  with  a careful  physical  examination,  nearly  all  patients  with  complicated malaria can be identified quickly and without sophisticated laboratory support.
Important elements of the physical examination include inspection for prostration (the inability to sit unaided or, in infants who cannot yet sit, to look for the mother's breast and feed) and deep breathing, assessing  the  Blantyre  [14]  or  Glasgow  Coma  Score  (Box  96.3), inspecting nail beds and conjunctivae for pallor (Fig. 96.6), cardiac and pulmonary auscultation for signs of high output cardiac failure (i.e.  a  systolic  murmur,  a  gallop  rhythm,  widened  pulse  pressure, enlarging  liver),  measuring  blood  pressure  and  checking  capillary refill  (Box  96.4)  (to  identify  patients  in  shock),  and  palpating  the abdomen to identify hepato- and splenomegaly and urinary retention. Acute renal failure will become evident over time on the basis of urinary output and can be confirmed by measures of serum creatinine. In order to identify hyperparasitemia, the capacity to stain blood films and count parasites is required.
Among patients meeting the standard clinical case definition of cerebral malaria [15], a careful ocular funduscopic exam is very useful for distinguishing  patients  with  'true'  cerebral  malaria  from  patients with incidental parasitemias and a non-malarial cause of coma (see ' Complicated Malaria ' below).

SEVERE ANEMIA
Life-threatening  anemia  can  develop  rapidly;  children  who  have adjusted to a low hemoglobin or hematocrit can rapidly decompensate when challenged by a febrile illness such as malaria. Decisions regarding  blood  transfusion  are  difficult,  particularly  in  malariaendemic areas where HIV infection is common. Decisions to transfuse are generally made on the basis of hemodynamic grounds (signs of high-output heart failure include hypotension, poor capillary refill, systolic  murmurs and hepatosplenomegaly), level of consciousness and evidence of acidosis. Estimates of parasite density are helpful in predicting the  need for blood transfusion (see  below, ' Treatment '). Anemic children who are clinically stable may be treated conservatively, but close observation is recommended.

RESPIRATORY FAILURE
Respiratory failure associated with ARDS can develop rapidly; clinically it is indistinguishable from the ARDS that develops as a result of septicemia, toxic inhalants or other causes.

ALGID MALARIA
The majority of patients with severe malaria remain well perfused, but  a  small  proportion  develop  algid  malaria  -  defined  as  low blood pressure, cold and clammy extremities, hypoglycemia and acidosis. In most cases, this represents septic shock and pathogens are cultured from the blood. The judicious administration of antibiotics,  fluids  and  inotropes  is  recommended  for  this  small  group  of patients.  The  sudden  onset  of  hypotension  in  a  patient  with  vivax malaria should prompt consideration of splenic rupture or subcapsular bleeding.

============================================================
CHUNK 41
============================================================
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
Mild proteinura, azotemia and oliguria occur frequently in otherwise uncomplicated P. falciparum infections. Acute renal failure is another complication that is far more common among adults than among children; it is also more common in patients with hemoglobinuria ('blackwater  fever').  Acute  renal  failure  can  also  result  from  acute tubular necrosis, a sequelae of reduced renal perfusion. Anuria is a poor prognostic sign and hemoperfusion, renal or peritoneal dialysis are  often  necessary.  Few  data  exist  to  describe  the  proportion  of patients  on  dialysis  who  recover  renal  function  but,  as  in  cerebral malaria, renal abnormalities are reversible and patients appropriately supported through the critical period often enjoy a full recovery.

POST-MALARIA NEUROLOGIC SYNDROME
This  is  a  rare  transient  neurologic  syndrome,  reported  most  commonly in non-immune travelers after a successfully treated episode of severe falciparum malaria. The onset is generally within 1-2 weeks of recovery, but can be as long as 2 months after. The clinical features range from confusion and tremors, to aphasia, seizures, ataxia, psychosis and impaired consciousness. There may be a lymphocytic pleocytosis in the CSF; imaging studies may or may not show nonspecific white matter changes. The symptoms are generally self-limiting; steroids have been used with good results in some patients [16].

CHUNK 43
============================================================
MALARIA IN PREGNANCY
The effects of malaria infection in pregnancy are visited on the expectant mother via peripheral parasitemia and on the fetus/newborn via parasite sequestration in the intervillous spaces of the placenta.
In general, pregnant woman are more susceptible to malaria infection than their non-pregnant counterparts; this is most noticeable in areas of  low  transmission,  where  few  adults  have  acquired  anti-disease immunity. Susceptibility to infection decreases with each succeeding pregnancy.
The placenta provides a new site for sequestration, a phenomenon unique  to  infections  with P.  falciparum ,  and,  as  with  peripheral
parasitemia, semi-immune women are less likely to have placental sequestration than non-immune women, and the placentae of multigravidae are less likely to contain evidence of parasite sequestration than those of primigravidae. The receptor on the syncytiotrophoblast lining the intervillous spaces of the placenta is chondroitin sulfate A, and binding is mediated by a specific variant surface antigen, var2csa [17].
Clinical manifestations in the mother are determined by the extent of acquired immunity. In sub-Saharan Africa, where most studies have been  carried  out,  mild  febrile  illnesses  and  anemia  are  the  most common features. In relatively non-immune pregnant women, severe and complicated malaria, often characterized by hypoglycemia and pulmonary edema, can occur. Pregnancy-induced immune suppression generally results in more severe disease, especially in the group at highest risk, primigravid, non-immune women. Parasitemia rates are  at  their  highest  during  the  second  trimester,  and  the  period  of increased risk can extend into the post-partum period for 1-2 months [18].
Adverse  maternal  and  perinatal  outcomes  of  malaria  in  pregnancy include anemia, miscarriage, fetal growth restriction (small for gestational age), low birth weight ( < 2500 g at birth), pre-term births and congenital  infection.  Again,  the  likelihood  of  these  outcomes  is related  to  maternal  gravidity  and  degree  of  acquired  anti-malarial immunity.

TRANSFUSION MALARIA
Any of the five species of human malaria can be transmitted directly from an infected blood donor, accidental infection by a contaminated needle, or from infected intravenous drug users sharing needles. The incubation period following infection is as short as a few days for P. falciparum, but can be up to 40 days or longer for P. malariae [19].

============================================================
CHUNK 45
============================================================
UNCOMPLICATED MALARIA
At the individual patient level, accurate diagnosis and treatment of uncomplicated malaria enhances the chances of a prompt cure and minimizes the likelihood of disease progression. At the population level,  the  appropriate  management of  uncomplicated malaria,  particularly large numbers of patients with uncomplicated malaria, as is common in endemic areas,  will  diminish  the  reservoir  of  infected individuals while minimizing the development and spread of drugresistant parasites.
To minimize the unnecessary or inappropriate use  of anti-malarial drugs, parasitologic confirmation of clinically suspected cases is now recommended  by  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  [20]. Malaria parasites can be identified in a sample of peripheral blood via light microscopy or using rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), which are based on the detection of parasite enzymes or antigens. When it is performed well, light microscopy is sensitive and specific and allows for the recognition of various malaria parasite species. There is a large initial  cost  for  acquiring  equipment  and  training  technicians,  and ongoing quality assurance and quality control are expensive, but the day-to-day operational costs are low, especially when high throughput is required. The 'gold standard' approach uses Giemsa stain and oilimmersion microscopy.
RDTs  are  antigen-based  dipstick,  cassette  or  card  tests  in  which  a colored line indicates that plasmodial antigens have been detected. They are relatively simple to perform and interpret and they do not require electricity, but not  all tests  can distinguish between species, and  some  cannot  distinguish  new  infections  from  recently  and effectively-treated infections (Box 96.5).

depends on its intended use. For example, does it need to distinguish between a recent malaria infection and a current infection? Should it  be  able  to  distinguish  between  falciparum  and  non-falciparum species? Will treatment decisions be based on the results, or is it being employed for epidemiologic purposes?
The choice of which malaria RDT to use in a given situation is complex and depends on availability, cost, quality of the test and performance characteristics. The WHO sponsors independent RDT product testing in collaboration with the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND), the Special Program for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases  (TDR)  and  the  WHO  Global  Malaria  Program  (GMP). Testing is performed at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Summary results of the most recent round are available  online  [21].  These  comparisons  help  to  inform  procurement decisions for national malaria control programs and to guide United Nations (UN) procurement policies.
In resource-constrained endemic areas, parasitologic diagnosis is not always available - even when it is available, quality and accuracy are a continuing challenge . When parasitologic diagnoses are not available, algorithms devised on the basis of the prevalence of parasitemia in various age groups [22] help to balance the risk of under-treating those at risk of progressing to severe disease against the risks of unnecessary drug use in the semi-immune population, excessive costs and drug pressure, which could accelerate the development of drug resistant parasites.
Serial parasitologic assessments after the start of treatment are helpful for documenting response to treatment; if these are paired with an assessment of anemia (either hemoglobin concentration or hematocrit), it may be possible to anticipate the need for blood transfusion (see below for guidelines).

============================================================
BLOOD FILMS
The gold standard of malaria diagnosis remains the blood film. For detecting parasites, a thick blood film is superior as it concentrates the red cells by a factor of 20-40. Identifying species on thick films may be difficult because the red cells have lysed and the morphologic features of the parasites have been altered. Species identifications are made more easily using thin blood films. Thick and thin films can be prepared on the same slide, although they are processed differently (thin films must be fixed in methanol before they are stained). Quantitating parasitemias, even semiquantitatively (0, + -++++ ) is useful for predicting whether the illness is likely to be caused by malaria, for anticipating the need for blood transfusion and for following response to anti-malarial treatment.
Parasites can be counted as a percentage of red cells on a thin film, or against white blood cells on a thick film, and if the total red cell or white cell counts are known, the parasite densities can be calculated. Blood can be stained with Giemsa, Leishman, Field or Wright's stains.
The  most  important  initial  distinction  is  to  determine  whether malaria parasites are present: for this, a thick film is most efficient. Species  identification  is  best  done  on  thin  films  (Table  96-1).  The golden brown malaria pigment (hemozoin) in monocytes or leukocytes suggests a current or recent malaria infection, even in the absence of a patent parasitemia.

INTERPRETING THE RESULTS OF MALARIA DIAGNOSTIC TESTS
In practice, clinicians in malaria-endemic areas with little diagnostic capacity  prescribe  anti-malarial  drugs  to  symptomatic  individuals whenever parasites are detected; however, the clinical challenge is to decide  if additional treatment  (e.g.  antibiotics)  is  needed.  In  semiimmune  individuals,  asymptomatic  or  'incidental'  parasitemia  is common, and the presence of peripheral parasitemia can be misleading. In these individuals, it would be prudent to consider other etiologies  for  the  symptoms,  particularly  in  patients  with  lower  density parasitemias (Box 96.2). Anti-malarial treatment is warranted if parasites are detected, but additional treatment may also be required.
A second dilemma is the febrile individual with a negative malaria test.  Withholding  anti-malarial  drugs  in  situations  where  malaria infection is a real possibility is difficult for clinicians. The dangers of missing  a  malaria  diagnosis  and  thus  delaying  treatment  are  well known. This apprehension, accompanied by a degree of skepticism regarding the reliability of the parasitologic diagnosis (especially via microscopy), is used to justify a 'better safe than sorry' approach to the  use  of  anti-malarial  drugs.  In  malaria-endemic  areas,  patients themselves,  along  with  parents  and  other  caregivers,  have  come  to expect malaria chemotherapy for many febrile illnesses. Clinical evidence for other non-malaria diagnoses should be sought (Box 96.2) to support the decision to withhold anti-malarials in patients who are not infected with plasmodia.

INTERPRETING THE RESULTS OF MALARIA DIAGNOSTIC TESTS
The absence of parasites in the peripheral blood should prompt the clinician to  consider  other  etiologies  of  the  patient's  symptoms.  In non-immune patients at risk for malaria infection, several parasitologic  assessments  carried  out  at  12-hour  intervals  during  a  36-48 hour period are recommended before concluding that the individual is free of infection. Intra-erythrocytic falciparum parasites are typically in circulation for the first 24-36 hours of the 48-hour lifecycle, and the intra-erythrocytic parasites for the other four infecting species are always present in the peripheral blood, so it is not necessary to 'time' blood  collections  to  any  particular  symptoms  (e.g.  fever,  rigor, diaphoresis). The WHO recommends withholding anti-malarial treatment in the face of negative (often repeatedly negative) tests; in practice,  as  noted  above,  this  can  be  difficult,  given  the  well-known dangers of untreated malaria and the challenges of obtaining a reliable parasitologic diagnosis.

COMPLICATED MALARIA
Parasitemic individuals with any of the clinical or laboratory features described in Table 96-2 are likely to have complicated malaria, but the possibility of a 'false-positive' assessment should be considered, particularly  (but  not  exclusively)  in  the  semi-immune  population. The mortality rate of untreated severe malaria is probably over 75%; with  good  management,  the  mortality  rate  of  cerebral  malaria  is roughly 15-20%.
Concomitant meningitis should be excluded via lumbar puncture; if a lumbar puncture is contraindicated on clinical grounds, the patient should be provided with the appropriate antibiotic coverage (penicillin + gentamicin, or ceftriaxone).
Co-infections with blood-borne bacteria are common and should be sought  when  the  capacity  exists  [23,  24].  Septic  shock  should  be considered in the differential diagnosis and empiric antibiotic therapy administered if there are signs of acidosis or impaired perfusion.
An autopsy-based study of pediatric cerebral malaria demonstrated that the standard clinical case definition of cerebral malaria was incorrect  in  approximately 25% of cases - non-malarial causes of death were identified and those patients had no evidence of parasite sequestration in the cerebral microcirculation. In contrast, 75% of cases in this series did have cerebral sequestration of parasitized erythrocytes and no other causes of death were identified at autopsy [25]. The best clinical indicator of 'true' cerebral malaria was the presence of at least one of the three features of a recently described malaria retinopathy: vessel color changes, macular or extra-macular whitening, and whitecentered hemorrhages [26] (Fig 96.7). With autopsy findings as the gold standard, the specificity of retinal findings is 93%, the sensitivity is 97% and the positive and negative predictive values are 97% and 93% respectively.

Severe  pneumonia  was  a  common  cause  of  death  in  parasitemic children who satisfied the clinical case definition of cerebral malaria in the autopsy study described above. Pneumonia may be suspected on  the  basis  of  the  history  and  physical  examination,  and  should definitely be considered when oxygen saturations are < 90%. Given the  frequency  of  this  particular  co-morbidity,  empiric  antibiotic therapy based on the clinical assessment is reasonable [28].

CLEARING THE PARASITE
For patients who are able to swallow, oral medications (Table 96-3) are recommended [20]. Prior treatment is common, and should be taken  into  consideration  when  deciding  how  to  treat  individual patients; quinine use following mefloquine may be arrhythmogenic, for instance.
Although chloroquine is no longer recommended by the WHO as the primary  treatment  of P.  falciparum infections,  it  remains  the  most commonly used drug in  a few parts of  the  world  including  Haiti, the  Dominican  Republic,  most  regions  of  the  Middle  East,  and Central America, west of the Panama Canal. Even in settings where chloroquine-resistance is widespread, the drug, an effective analgesic and antipyretic, has considerable popularity.
Chloroquine  is  recommended  for  the  blood-stage  infections  of P. malariae , P. ovale and most P. vivax infections. Chloroquine-resistant vivax  malaria  has  been  reported  from  Indonesia  and  Papua  New Guinea, and those infections should be treated with artemisinin combination  therapies,  atovaquone-proguanil,  mefloquine  or  quinine followed by doxycyline or tetracycline.
Primaquine is required for radical cures of the liver stage parasites in P. vivax and P. ovale . In most situations, a daily dose (0.25-0.5 mg/ kg)  of  primaquine  for  two  weeks  is  sufficient.  Patients  should  be screened for G6PD-deficiency prior to administration of primaquine. In  settings  where  laboratory  testing  is  not  available,  a  test  dose  of primaquine followed by careful observation and repeated measures of hemoglobin or hematocrit may be necessary.
In  general,  though,  monotherapy  for  falciparum  malaria  has  been supplanted by drug combinations (co-formulated or co-packaged) of artemisinin-based compounds (rapidly parasiticidal, but with short half-lives)  and  partner  drugs  (more  slowly  acting,  but  with  longer half-lives). The artemisinins typically clear 90% of the parasites within 24-36  hours  and  the  partner  drug  clears  the  rest.  Most  regimens (Table 96-3) require twice daily administration of the drug combination over three days. The WHO currently recommends five different combinations;  specific  choices  depend  on  prevailing  parasite  drug sensitivities, procurement opportunities and cost [20].

CHUNK 55
============================================================
CLEARING THE PARASITE
For patients who are unable to swallow, parenteral drug treatment is  required;  both  options  are  contemporary  formulations  of  traditional, plant-based remedies. Quinine (and its stereoisomer, quinidine) come from the bark of the cinchona tree and the artemisinins are  derived  from Artemesia  annua ,  known  colloquially  as  'sweet wormwood'.
The cinchona alkaloids have been the mainstay of treatment for complicated malaria since they were introduced to Europe from Peru in the 17th century. Quinine is used more commonly, but quinidine is as  effective,  albeit  more  likely  to  engender  cardiac  dysrhythmias. Although the IV route is preferred,  intramuscular  administration  is effective - the drug, as formulated (at 300 mg base/ml) is fairly acidic, though and should be diluted 4-6-fold prior to intramuscular injection.  Large-volume injections should be divided between two large muscle masses (preferably the anterior thighs).
Irrespective of the alkaloid selected, a loading dose is required in order to  achieve  a  therapeutic  drug  concentration  quickly.  More  care  is required to administer quinine and quinidine than the artemisinins. Quinine and quinidine, when infused too rapidly, stimulate the pancreatic secretion of insulin and hypoglycemia may ensue.
Intravenous quinine was enshrined as the treatment for severe malaria well before pharmacokinetic studies were possible; current regimens have evolved on the basis of experience and some computer modeling.  Regimens  for  intramuscular  quinine  and  the  intravascular/ intramuscular formulations of the artemisinin derivatives are based on sound pharmacokinetics (Table 96-4).
Randomized clinical trials comparing IV quinine with IV artesunate have established the superiority of IV artesunate in adults and children [29, 30].
Patients  with  complicated  malaria  should  receive  parenteral  antimalarials for at least 24 hours; after that, a full course of an effective oral drug can be administered, beginning as soon as the patient can swallow (Table 96-4).

PREGNANT PATIENTS
For  pregnant  women  living  in  malaria-endemic  areas,  the  WHO recommends  Intermittent  Preventive  Treatment  during  pregnancy (IPTp)  [20]  with  two  doses  of  sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine  (SP) administered at monthly intervals after the onset of fetal movements. IPTp  should  be  extended  into  the  third  trimester  for  HIV-infected pregnant women who are not taking cotrimoxazole prophylaxis.
Chemotherapy for pregnant women who develop malaria illnesses during pregnancy is similar to that recommended for non-pregnant patients with the following caveats:
- few pharmacokinetic studies have been carried out in pregnant women;
- chloroquine is well tolerated;
- the recommended doses of quinine and quinidine are safe;
- mefloquine may be associated with an increased risk of stillbirth [31],  but  can  be  used  when  no  other  treatment  options  are available;
- tetracycline,  doxycycline,  primaquine  and  halofantrine  are  contraindicated in pregnancy, and neither primaquine or the tetracyclines should be used while breastfeeding;
- primaquine is contraindicated during pregnancy, given the uncertain G6PD status of the fetus.
There are very few data on the safety of the artemisinin drugs during pregnancy;  in  general,  they  are  not  recommended  during  the  first trimester and amodiaquine use during pregnancy is eschewed because of the risk of agranulocytosis.

Supportive care
Dedicated  nursing  care  is  important  in  the  management  of  these patients.  Vital  signs,  urine  output  and  an  appropriate  coma  score should be monitored as frequently as possible. The most common causes of a drop in coma score following the initiation of therapy are convulsions, hypoglycemia and anemia. Blood glucose, lactate, parasitemia  and  hemoglobin/hematocrit  can  be  monitored  every  4-6 hours on fingerprick samples of blood. Patients not on ventilatory support should be nursed in the lateral decubitus position to minimize the chance of aspiration. IV fluids containing 5% dextrose are important initially, but nasogastric tube feeding can be started within 18-24 hours of admission if the patient is unable to eat.

Fever
There is no consensus on how best to treat malarial fevers.

Convulsions
Fits  are  a  very  common  complication  of  malaria  illnesses.  Febrile convulsions are distinguished by a fairly rapid recovery of consciousness  but,  in  patients with cerebral  malaria, the coma is often initiated  with  a convulsion.  Multiple fits are common, as are clinically 'silent'  fits,  evident  only  electroencephalographically.  In  practice, decisions regarding the use of anti-epileptic drugs are made on the basis of a thoughtful and detailed clinical exam focusing on the eyes (looking for evidence of nystagmus, hippus [also known as pupillary athetosis  -  spasmodic,  rhythmic  ( < 0.04 Hz),  but  irregular  dilating and  contracting  pupillary  movements  involving  the  sphincter  and dilator  muscles]  and  absence  of  the  light  reflex),  the  respiratory rate  and  rhythm  (shallow,  irregular  respirations  may  be  a  'seizure equivalent'), the mouth and fingers (infrequent fine twitching movements of the tongue, a single finger, or the corner of the mouth can also  be  seizure  equivalents).  Occasionally,  seizures  emerge  when hypoglycemia is corrected. Often a trial of a rapidly acting anticonvulsant  (i.e.  paraldehyde  or  diazepam)  can  help  to  identify  subtle convulsions.
Standard anticonvulsant protocols are difficult to develop because of the  heterogeneity  of  the  patient  population,  but  commonly  used drugs include the benzodiazpines (IV, per rectum [PR] or sublingual), paraldehyde (IM), phenobarbital (IV) and phenytoin (IV). There is little experience with levetiracetam in malaria to date, but it may prove to be useful. A study of prophylactic phenobarbital, administered on admission to children with cerebral malaria, was deleterious [32]; as a result, clinicians are advised to treat clinically-evident seizures and to watch for subtle evidence for subclinical events.

CHUNK 66
============================================================
Anemia
The  evidence  base  for  treating  severe  malarial  anemia  is  scanty. 'Transfusion  triggers'  are  difficult  to  develop  because  the  rate  at which an anemia develops is as important as the absolute value of the hemoglobin concentration but, in general, transfusions begin to be considered when the hemoglobin drops below 5 gm/dL [packed cell volume (PCV) = 15%]. Clinical clues include signs of hemodynamic  instability  (passive  congestion  of  the  liver, systolic  flow murmurs, extra heart sounds, rales, tachycardia) and cerebral hypoperfusion.  The  clinical  decision  regarding  transfusion  should  take into account the peripheral parasitemia, as well as the hemoglobin concentration (or hematocrit): the higher the parasitemia, the lower the hemoglobin or hematocrit are likely to drop. The usual practice is  to  transfuse  whole  blood (20 ml/kg) or  packed cells (10 ml/kg), irrespective  of  the  degree  of  the  anemia  or  the  intensity  of  the parasitemia.  About  5%  of  pediatric patients require a  second transfusion.

============================================================
CHUNK 67
============================================================
Hypoglycemia
Patients with severe malaria can develop hypoglycemia if quinine is infused too rapidly; when it develops as part of the disease process, it worsens the prognosis for the patient. If hypoglycemia is identified, the  patient  should  be  given  50%  dextrose  (1 ml/kg)  IV,  and  the glucose should be re-checked soon thereafter and then regularly until they regain consciousness.

CHUNK 68
============================================================
Acidosis
Acidosis in severe malaria is manifested as deep, Kussmaul-like respirations  [33]  and  can  occur  with,  or  without,  associated  hyperlactatemia. It is frequently a sign of hypovolemia [34]. A large trial in children  with  a  variety  of  febrile  illnesses  (57%  had  malaria)  and 'compensated  shock' compared bolus therapy (normal saline and albumin) with conservative management with no boluses and found that  outcomes  were  significantly  better  in  those  who  received  no additional  fluid  bolus  [35].  When  justified,  blood  transfusions  are helpful in this situation; when blood is not indicated, cautious fluid repletion, beginning with normal saline (10 ml/kg) may be helpful. Acidosis may also be a sign of sepsis so collecting a blood culture and starting empiric antibiotic therapy may be justified.

Pulmonary edema/ARDS
This complication is more common in adults, and can develop several days  after  admission  and  the  initiation  of  anti-malarial  treatment. Prompt intubation and assisted ventilation are the only recognized treatments;  clinical trials of this specific malaria  complication  have not been carried out, so treatment recommendations are based on extrapolations from other conditions [35].

Renal failure
This complication is also more common in adults with severe malaria than in children. Untreated, the mortality rate is over 70%. Patients should receive adequate renal replacement therapy - hemofiltration is  superior  to  peritoneal  dialysis  in  terms  of  mortality  and  costeffectiveness [36]. The role of hemodialysis has not been assessed in a randomized trial, but is likely to be superior to peritoneal dialysis in patients who are hemodynamically stable [37].

Many trials of adjuvant therapies targeting putative pathogenic processes  have  been  conducted.  Only  a  few,  even  when  subjected  to meta-analysis, have been adequately powered, and none has demonstrated a positive impact on outcome (Table 96-5).

CONCLUSION
Malaria remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in endemic areas, and is the largest single cause of fever in travelers returning from malaria-endemic  regions.  Prompt  recognition  and  treatment  of malaria disease is helpful in terms of preventing disease progression, and prompt recognition and treatment of non-malarial disease (even in parasitemic individuals) is equally important.
Patients with severe and complicated malaria can be managed well in resource-poor settings with careful attention to IV fluid support, blood transfusions, convulsions, blood glucose and the airway.

PLASMODIUM OVALE
Plasmodium ovale was first described in the blood of a soldier returning  from  East  Africa  in  1922  [38].  Although P.  ovale has  been reported from all continents, it is only in tropical Africa and New Guinea that it is relatively common. In West Africa, a blood film P.  ovale parasite  positive  rate  between  0.7%  and  10%  has  been found [39]. Plasmodium ovale is  a  common cause of morbidity in the  endemic  communities  with  the  highest  incidence  of  febrile episodes among children aged 0-7 years old, but clinical attacks can be seen in all age groups. Plasmodium ovale can be seen in up to 15% of returning travelers. As febrile episodes are often treated empirically in endemic areas and the confirmation of low-density P. ovale infections by microscopy is demanding, the true incidence of P.  ovale malaria  is  likely  underestimated. Plasmodium  ovale in African immigrants can present months after arrival in a new region.
Characterization of P. ovale from Southeast Asia based on the small subunit  rRNA  gene  and  parts  of  the  cysteine  protease,  ookinete surface protein and cytochrome b genes, indicate that P. ovale can be divided into at least two types - classic and variant - which do not differ morphologically [40]. Variant P.  ovale is associated with a higher parasite density in humans. A recent study of 55 P.  ovale isolates from around the world showed that variant and classic P. ovale co-exist and do not recombine [41].
Plasmodium  ovale causes  a  relatively  mild  form  of  malaria  that  is very rarely severe (ARDS) or fatal (death caused by splenic rupture reported). The most frequent symptoms are fever with temperatures higher  than  38.5°C  (seen  in  half  the  cases),  body  aches,  chills, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea and nonproductive cough. Mild heptomegaly  and  splenomegaly,  thrombocytopenia  lower  than 100,000/mm 3 , elevation in hepatic  enzymes (AST/ALT) and  mild

PLASMODIUM OVALE
Plasmodium ovale is  considered a relapsing malaria [42]. However, the  relapse  frequency  and  relapse  interval  of P.  ovale is  poorly described. Recently, the  existence  of a  true  hypnozoite in P.  ovale malaria has been questioned [43]. The existence of P. ovale hypnozoites  has  never  been  proven  by  biologic  experiments.  On  one hand, indirect evidence of the existence of hypnozoites, i.e. reports on  the  occurrence  of  true  relapses  undoubtedly  caused  by  this parasite is rare; true P. ovale relapses have been reported only occasionally.  On  the  other  hand, P.  ovale cases  reported  without  any preventive  medication  where  relapses  did  not  occur  outnumber reported relapses caused by this parasite. If true hypnozoites exist then the relapse frequency must be very low.

============================================================
CHUNK 78
============================================================
DIAGNOSIS
There tends to be lower initial parasitemias ( < 500 parasites per μ l) with P. ovale malaria, making the diagnosis by routine microscopy insensitive. Plasmodium ovale and P. vivax can be difficult to distinguish morphologically by oil immersion microscopy. Mixed infections, especially in endemic areas, are common. In endemic regions where P.  falciparum and/or P.  vivax predominate, P.  ovale is  frequently overlooked. For more accurate diagnosis and estimates of the burden of P. ovale infections, more sensitive diagnostic methods are needed [44].
Plasmodium  ovale malaria  is  currently  problematic  to  diagnose in travelers,  with  early  attempts  complicated  by  the  lack of specific clinical features, the rarity of biologic changes and the poor sensitivity of diagnostic tools to detect low parasitaemia. Thus, the diagnosis is commonly delayed or missed.
Molecular diagnosis and differentiation of the two subspecies can be accomplished with PCR protocols in reference laboratories [45], but  the  genetic  polymorphisms  of  the  two  subspecies  require appropriate protocols [46].
Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have not been developed to detect P. ovale , and the performance of currently-available RDTs varies greatly in  their  capability  to  detect P.  ovale parasites.  Sensitivity  varies between 0% and 80%, with parasite density a key factor [47-50]. A negative RDT test result cannot exclude the diagnosis of P. ovale malaria.

============================================================
CHUNK 79
============================================================
TREATMENT
Chloroquine at 25 mg/kg divided over three days is the treatment of choice if a mono-infection with P. ovale is confirmed. Artemisinin combination treatments (ACTs) are effective and could be used in settings of diagnostic uncertainty. Currently, a radical cure dose of 30 mg primaqine base (0.5 mg/kg) by mouth daily for 14 days is recommended to eliminate hypnozoites; however, note the controversy in this regard above. Use of lower dose primaquine has been associated with therapeutic failures and recurrent P.  ovale malaria [51].

CHUNK 80
============================================================
PLASMODIUM MALARIAE
Plasmodium malariae was first described by Golgi in 1886 when he noted the relationship between the 72-hour lifecycle of the parasite in the blood of patients and the corresponding appearance of fever and  chills  (the  paroxysm)  [52].  Fever  caused  by P.  malariae was historically known as 'quartan malaria' because of the appearance of fever every fourth day (assuming the first day of fever is day 1). Plasmodium malariae has  been reported from all continents but is only relatively common in tropical Africa and the Southwest Pacific. The prevalence of P. malariae varies from less than 1% to as high as 30-40%  in  focal  areas  of  West  Africa  and  Indonesia  based  on standard light microscopy detection of parasites on thick films. In the endemic communities, P. malariae is a common cause of morbidity with the highest incidence of febrile episodes among children  less  then  10  years  old.  As  febrile  episodes  are  often  treated empirically and the confirmation of low-density P.  malariae infections  by  mi  croscopy  is  difficult,  the  true  incidence  of P.  malariae malaria is underestimated.
Plasmodium  malariae is  unique  in  that  without  treatment,  blood stage parasites persist for  extremely  long periods of time -  likely the lifetime of the host. The persistent, low-density parasitemia in otherwise healthy individuals may produce distinctive clinical features, or individuals may be so asymptomatic that they qualify as blood  donors.  This  is  why P.  malariae causes  about  25% [53]  of transfusion related cases of malaria although it accounts for only 1-2% of imported cases of malaria [54].
Likewise,  asymptomatic persons can re-introduce P.  malariae into previously  malaria-free  areas  [55].  Years  later,  when  carriers  are immunosuppressed with drugs [56] or stressed by surgery [57], the parasites can recrudesce and they become symptomatic with typical symptoms of malaria.
The most important and unique feature of prolonged P.  malariae parasitemia  is  an  irreversible,  immune-mediated,  nephrotic  symdrome first noted in West Africa in the 1960s [58, 59]. Nephrotic syndrome caused by P. malariae can also present outside of malaria endemic areas years after the last exposure [60].

============================================================
CHUNK 81
============================================================
CLINICAL PRESENTATION
Plasmodium malariae is a relatively mild form of malaria, although the initial paroxysms can be similar to those seen with P. falciparum and P.  vivax .  The  undifferentiated  febrile presentation  is indistinguishable from other malarias. Deaths associated with P.  malariae are not from acute infection but rather caused by end-stage renal disease [61].
The nephrotic syndrome associated with chronic P. malariae is  caused by  an  immune  complex,  basement  membrane  nephropathy  and presents  no  differently  from  nephrotic  syndrome  associated  with other causes. Usually, there is a several-month history of progressively worsening lower extremity edema, frothy urine, hyper  tension and multiple abnormal laboratory findings including proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia,  hyperlipidemia,  high  serum  creatinine  and anemia. Renal biopsy is usually required to confirm the diagnosis and properly guide management [61]. Plasmodium malariae as  the true cause of the nephrotic syndrome may be very difficult to diagnose because the patients may have exceedingly low parasitemias and negative rapid diagnostic test (RDT) results. Parasitologic confirmation in this syndrome requires exhaustive, expert, microscopic review of smears and carefully directed molecular methods [60].

============================================================
CHUNK 82
============================================================
DIAGNOSIS
The  preferred  diagnostic  method  to  confirm P.  malariae remains traditional Giemsa-stained thick and thin peripheral blood smears. In the growing parasite, pigment increases rapidly with many jetblack  granules.  The  trophozoite  assumes  variable  shapes  but often stretches across the width of the red blood cell to appear as a 'band form' (see Fig. 96.3), which is often considered diagnostic, although this band form can be seen with other species, especially P. knowlesi and P. inui . Red blood cells infected with trophozoites of P. malariae parasites are not enlarged and do not contain prominent stippling, which distinguishes them from P. vivax and P. ovale [62].
When considering the microscopic diagnosis of P.  malariae ,  three considerations should be kept in mind:
- there tends to be lower initial and maximal parasitemias with P. malariae than  with  other  species  because  the  number  of  merozoites  per  red  blood  cell  replication  cycle  is  lower  (6-14),  the
●
- three-day  versus  two-day  developmental  cycle  produces  slower growth, and P. malariae 's preference for older red blood cells limits the number of cells that can be infected [62];
- in endemic regions where P. falciparum and/or P. vivax predominate, mixed infections are the rule and P.  malariae is  frequently overlooked  unless  more  sensitive  diagnostic  methods,  such  as molecular diagnostic tests, are used [63];
- even  careful  microscopic  examination  may  not  be  sufficient to morphologically distinguish P.  knowlesi -  an  emerging cause of severe and potentially fatal malaria in Southeast Asia - from P. malariae on the peripheral smear [64]. Molecular methods may be needed to confirm the diagnosis of P. malariae where the two parasite distributions overlap.

============================================================
CHUNK 83
============================================================
DIAGNOSIS
RDTs for malaria are not developed to specifically diagnose P. malariae, and the detection of parasites relies on various panPlasmodium capture reagents not specifically optimized for P. malariae . The performance  of  currently  available  RDTs  varies  greatly  (0-100%)  in their capability to detect P.  malariae parasites. Clinical studies are usually designed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of RDTs for P. falciparum and P. vivax , and small numbers of P. malariae are encountered and reported. Whether the poor sensitivity is because of the very low parasitemias (and presumably low antigen levels) in patients or because of the lack of cross-reaction with the capture reagents is not known. A negative RDT test result cannot exclude the diagnosis of P. malariae malaria.
Molecular  testing  is  not  commercially  available  or  standardized, and results may vary based on regional differences in target gene sequences; caution should be used when relying solely on molecular results to make clinical decisions. As also seen in P.  ovale ,  the targets  of P.  malariae molecular  probes  may  exhibit  geographic variation  suggesting  subspecies  of P.  malariae [65]  and  an  additional reason why PCR reactions could yield a false-negative result.

============================================================
CHUNK 84
============================================================
TREATMENT
The  treatment  of  choice  for  the  typical,  uncomplicated  febrile illness associated with P. malariae mono-infection is chloroquine at 25 mg/kg total dose divided over three days. Artemisinin combination  treatments  (ACTs),  as  well  as  other  anti-malarial  drugs,  are effective and could be used in settings of diagnostic uncertainty.
Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of occasional recurrent parasitemias  with  clinical  symptoms  following  treatment  with  a standard course  of  chloroquine [66]. These cases  likely  represent delayed  parasite  clearance  rather  than  true  resistance.  There  is  a 16-59 day range in the length of the pre-patent period in experimental mosquito transmitted P. malariae [62] and it is thought that some  parasites  could  emerge  from  the  liver  days  or  weeks  after treatment is  initiated when drug levels are inadequate to prevent parasitemia [67]. On such occasions, either re-treatment with a full treatment course of chloroquine or another standard anti-malarial treatment regimen would be satisfactory.
Treating the  underlying P.  malariae in  fully  established  nephrotic syndrome does not improve renal function, as segmental sclerosis and  hyalinization  of  the  nephron  are  irreversible.  These  patients often become hemodialysis dependent. To prevent end-stage renal disease, P.  malariae must be considered, diagnosed and effectively treated as soon as renal symptoms develop [61].

CHUNK 85
============================================================
PLASMODIUM KNOWLESI
Plasmodium  knowlesi is  primarily  a  parasite  infecting  macaque monkeys. Sporadic human infections, generally linked to macaque exposures,  were  the  rule  [68],  (aside  from  a  brief  flirtation  with P. knowlesi as malaria therapy for syphilis in the 1930s [69]), until a 2004 outbreak of 'hyperparasitemic P. malariae ' in the Kapit division of Malaysian Borneo was confirmed as P. knowlesi using molecular  methods  [70]. Plasmodium  knowlesi is  now  established  as  a
common cause of malaria on the Malaysian Peninsula in particular, and in Southeast Asia in general, especially in populations living in close proximity to the simian reservoir [81].
The most common clinical syndrome is a febrile illness, indistinguishable  from  uncomplicated  falciparum  malaria,  but  a  small proportion of patients ( < 10%) progress to severe and complicated disease,  in  which  respiratory  distress  (ARDS)  and  renal  failure feature  more  prominently  than  in  severe  falciparum malaria [68, 71-74]. In contrast to falciparum malaria, coma is a relatively rare  complication  of  infection  with P.  knowlesi .  Surprisingly,  the salient  findings  in  the  one  case  of  fatal P.  knowlesi malaria  that was  autopsied  are  similar  to  fatal  falciparum  malaria:  there  was selective  accumulation  of  parasitized red cells  in  the  brain, heart and  kidneys,  the  brain  was  slate  gray  in  color  and  there  were petechial hemorrhages scattered through the cerebrum and cerebellum [75]. Plasmodium knowlesi is a quotidian parasite, undergoing asexual replication every 24 hours, which may explain the relatively high  incidence  of  severe  anemia  [73].  Thrombocytopenia,  often profound, is nearly a constant feature in P. knowlesi infections, but no  clinically  evident  coagulopathies  have  been  reported [71-74]. The disease in children is fairly similar to that in adults, but there is  one  striking  contrast  in  pediatric  infections  with P.  knowlesi compared  with P.  falciparum :  pediatric P.  knowlesi infection  is restricted to school-age children, whereas falciparum malaria affects all ages [72].

============================================================
CHUNK 86
============================================================
PLASMODIUM KNOWLESI
Microscopically, P.  knowlesi resembles P.  falciparum young  ring stages and P. malariae in the mature trophozoite blood stages, therefore  a  high  index  of  suspicion  and  judicious  use  of  molecular methods are required to establish the diagnosis definitively [76]. Median parasitemias are typically approximately 1400 parasites per microliter (interquartile range 6-250,000) [71]. To date, there is no evidence that P. knowlesi is a relapsing malaria and, thus far, treatment with a  wide variety of anti-malarial  drugs (quinine, artesunate, various artemisinin combination therapies [ACTs], mefloquine, with and without primaquine) have been successful [71-74].
Plasmodium  knowlesi malaria  has  been  called  the  'fifth  human malaria',  but  there  is,  as  yet,  no  definitive  evidence  for  cyclical transmission by mosquitoes from human to human. Without this evidence,  it  remains  a  simian  malaria  with  occasional  zoonotic human infections [77].  Analysis  of  archival  blood  films  suggests that P.  knowlesi has infected humans for many years in Malaysian Borneo [78] and recent epidemiologic studies suggest that macaque monkeys are the reservoir host [79]. The recent upsurge in clinical episodes may be related to changes in human exposure to monkeys, deforestation and a decline in P. vivax infections [80].

============================================================
CHUNK 87
============================================================
DIAGNOSIS
Plasmodium knowlesi infections are limited to areas where humans (local residents or travelers) are near the reservoir hosts: long-tailed (Macaca fasciularis )  and pig-tailed macaques ( Macaca nemestrina ). Microscopic identification of a malaria infection is the first step, but because of the morphologic similarities between P.  falciparum,  P. malariae and P. knowlesi, the definitive diagnosis of P. knowlesi rests on molecular detection using a nested PCR technique [14]. Combinations of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) can be used to increase diagnostic certainty, but there is no RDT specifically for P. knowlesi at this time.

============================================================
CHUNK 88
============================================================
TREATMENT
This  parasite  has  been  subjected  to  less  drug  pressure  than  any other  malaria  parasite  infecting  humans  and  has  been  fully  susceptible  to  a  broad  range  of  anti-malarial  drugs  administered according to standard oral and parenteral regimens (chloroquine, quinine, artemether-lumefantrine, artesunate [71-74]). Primaquine  has  been  used  as  presumptive  anti-relapse  treatment, but there is no evidence of  a  hypnozoite stage, so it may not be necessary [74].
