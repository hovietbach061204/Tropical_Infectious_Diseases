with amastigotes)
Protozoan  parasites  of  the  genus Leishmania ,  transmitted  by  sandflies  of  the  genera Phlebotomus (Old  World  leishmaniasis)  and Lutzomyia (New World leishmaniasis) cause a diverse group of cutaneous and visceral clinical syndromes that can be referred to as the leishmaniases.

============================================================
CHUNK 4
============================================================
LIFE CYCLE
The Leishmania life cycle is shown in Figure 99.1. Promastigotes in the female sandfly are introduced into the skin of a vertebrate host during a  blood  meal.  The  promastigotes  invade  reticulo-endothelial  cells, transform into amastigotes (round- or oval-shaped structures) measuring 2-5 μ m in diameter found within reticuloendothelial cells (Fig. 99.2).  Amastigotes  multiply  within  phagolysosomes,  and  invade other  reticuloendothelial  cells  [1].  In  Wright's-  or  Giemsa-stained preparations,  the  pale  blue  cytoplasm  is  surrounded  by  a  plasma membrane and contains a  large,  dark purple nucleus  and  a  small, purple,  rod-shaped structure - the kinetoplast.  The  kinetoplast is a complex body and appears as an electron-dense granular band with a distinct fibrillar pattern, lying within an extension of the mitochondrion.  Sandflies  feeding  on  infected  individuals  ingest  parasitized cells, and the amastigotes transform into promastigotes, which multiply in the gut and migrate to the proboscis, completing the cycle.

TAXONOMY
The taxonomy of Leishmania can be confusing, and there is no single, generally  agreed-on  classification.  One  clinically  useful  taxonomic classification is presented in Table 99-1. Although minor differences in size and morphology of amastigotes are reported, the species that infect humans cannot be reliably distinguished morphologically. Reference isolates are assigned to species and subspecies based on their geographic origin, the clinical syndrome they produce, developmental  biology  in  sand  flies  and  ecologic  characteristics.  Traditionally, promastigotes derived from in  vitro culture  are analyzed by  protein electrophoresis and the pattern of isoenzymes obtained is compared

CLINICAL CLASSIFICATION
A  simplified  clinical  classification  separates  the  leishmaniases  into three  major  syndromes:  (1)  visceral  leishmaniasis,  (2)  cutaneous leishmaniasis, and (3) mucosal leishmaniasis. (Table 99-2) Visceral leishma  niasis is characterized classically by fever, wasting, pancytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly (especially splenomegaly), and hypergammaglobulinemia. 'Incomplete', or atypical, syndromes, in which one or more of these clinical features are missing, are common. Visceral leishmaniasis is usually caused by parasites of the Leishmania donovani complex. The typical clinical presentation of cutaneous leishmaniasis is a localized, nonhealing ulcerative skin lesion. Less common cutaneous leishmaniasis presentations include nodular, psoriaform and verrucous  forms.  Other,  less  common,  cutaneous  syndromes  include diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis, post-Kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) and  leishmaniasis  recidivans.  In  the  New  World,  mucosal leishmaniasis is most often associated with Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis and characterized by a primary cutaneous lesion that may be
FIGURE 99.3 A sand>y: Phlebotomus longipes .
followed months to years later by destructive nasopharyngeal lesions ('espundia').  In  the  Old  World,  mucosal  leishmaniasis-like  syndromes associated with Leishmania major have rarely been reported.
Another  clinically  useful  classification  is  to  describe  clinical  syndromes in terms of the parasite burden. For example, polyparasitic syndromes, such as visceral leishmaniasis and diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis, are characterized by very large numbers of parasites in the host. Oligoparasitic syndromes, such as mucosal and cutaneous leishmaniasis and leishmaniasis recidivans, have relatively fewer parasites. This has implications for the clinician in choosing the best technique for diagnosis and determining optimal treatment.

TRANSMISSION AND EPIDEMIOLOGY
The  phlebotomine  sandflies  that  transmit Leishmania parasites  are small (1.5-2.5 mm), hairy flies that are recognized by their characteristic hopping movement and the position of their wings, which are held in a nearly erect V configuration over the body (Fig. 99.3). Sandflies are generally inactive in daylight, seeking shelter in dark, moist places. They breed in dark, damp places rich in organic matter, for example leaf litter in tropical rain forests, rubble and loose earth, caves and rock holes [2]. Female sandflies feed on a variety of warm- and

They can acquire Leishmania with their first blood meal and are capable of disease transmission 7-10 days later. They then remain  infective  throughout  adult  life,  which  is  usually only a few weeks. Leishmania -infected sandflies have abnormal feeding behavior, with increased probing while attempting to take a blood meal. This behavior may facilitate transmission to the vertebrate host.

============================================================
CHUNK 12
============================================================
TRANSMISSION AND EPIDEMIOLOGY
Sandfly saliva contains maxadilan, a potent vasodilatory peptide. The presence, and relative abundance, of maxadilan has been correlated with  the  course  of  human  infection.  For  example,  sandflies  of  the Lutzomyia longipalpis complex transmit Leishmania chagasi in the New World. Visceral leishmaniasis caused by L. chagasi is common in Brazil but rare in Costa Rica, whereas non-ulcerative cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. chagasi is found in Costa Rica but not in Brazil. Costa Rican sandfly  saliva has a negligible content of salivary maxadilan, induces  very  little  erythema  but  enhances  cutaneous  proliferation, whereas Brazilian sandfly saliva has more  maxadilan,  induces moderate-to-marked  erythema,  but  does  not  exacerbate  cutaneous infections [3]. Substances in sandfly saliva are at least partly responsible for the tropism observed in Leishmania isolates.
Transmission of Leishmania is either zoonotic (mammalian reservoir, often canine  or  rodent  reservoirs)  or  anthroponotic  (human  reservoir). Zoonotic transmission can occur in completely wild (sylvatic) or peri-domestic situations. Two important human diseases - Indian sub-continent visceral leishmaniasis caused by L. donovani and urban cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania tropica - are characterized by anthroponotic transmission [4]. The epidemiology of various forms of leishmaniasis is discussed in Chapters 99.2, 99.3 and 99.4 below.
Globally, there are an estimated 1.5-2.0 million new cases and 70,000 deaths annually, and about 350 million are at risk of infection. Cutaneous  leishmaniasis  is  endemic  in  more  than  70  countries  of  the tropics and neo-tropics, with 90% of cases reported from Afghanistan, Algeria, Brazil, Pakistan, Peru, Saudi Arabia, and Syria [5]. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is under-reported in most areas and active surveillance reveals a 5-10-fold higher number of actual cases.

============================================================
CHUNK 13
============================================================
TRANSMISSION AND EPIDEMIOLOGY
Although most parasite transmission is by the bite of infected sand flies,  several other routes of transmission include blood transfusion [6],  needle-sharing  in  drugs  users  [7],  congenital  transmission  [8], sexual contact [9] and laboratory accidents [10].

============================================================
CHUNK 14
============================================================
IMMUNOLOGY
The  protective  immune response to leishmaniasis is primarily cellmediated. High titers of antibodies detected in visceral leishmaniasis appear to play no part in defense against the parasite. In contrast, a positive leishmanin skin test correlates with resistance to leishmaniasis. It is negative during active visceral leishmaniasis, becoming positive  after  recovery.  In  addition,  some  patients  with  subclinical, self-curing visceral leishmaniasis have had positive leishmanin skin tests associated with well-developed tuberculoid granulomas demonstrated in liver biopsies. Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) is not entirely beneficial, as it also causes tissue destruction. The onset of ulceration correlates with the development of a positive leishmanin skin test in cutaneous  leishmaniasis.  In  mucosal  leishmaniasis,  the  reaction  to the  leishmanin  skin  test  is  much  larger  in  individuals  with  more severe mucosal damage.

============================================================
CHUNK 15
============================================================
SPECTRUM OF CLINICAL DISEASE
In all forms of leishmaniasis, there is a spectrum of clinical disease [1 1]. In cutaneous leishmaniasis, the spectrum varies from a progressive  nonhealing  lesions  associated  with  anergy  (diffuse  cutaneous leishmaniasis)  to  the  exaggerated  hypersensitivity  seen  in  mucosal leishmaniasis  and  leishmaniasis  recidivans,  in  which  severe  tissue damage is mediated by the immune response. In visceral leishmaniasis, many infections are subclinical and self-healing, although malnutrition or an immunosuppressive  process can reactivate latent infection. In those who develop the syndrome of visceral leishmaniasis,  delayed  hypersensitivity  specifically  to  leishmanial antigens and nonspecifically to tuberculin and other unrelated antigens is suppressed; there is proliferation of reticuloendothelial cells and an exaggerated humoral immune response with the production of polyclonal, nonprotective immunoglobulins.

============================================================
CHUNK 16
============================================================
DIAGNOSTIC TESTING
Parasitologic diagnosis refers to the demonstration of amastigotes in tissues  or  clinical  specimens,  visualizing  promastigotes  in in  vitro cultures or the detection of parasite  genetic material. Immunologic diagnosis refers to the detection of an antibody or delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response in the host to Leishmania antigens.
It  is  important  to  note  there  is  not  a  single  diagnostic  test  that  is optimal in all clinical settings. It is always preferable to perform more than  one  parasitologic  assay  when  possible.  For  example,  smears, cultures, and PCR can be employed in the confirmation of parasites from a bone marrow or splenic aspirate.

============================================================
CHUNK 17
============================================================
IN VITRO CULTURE
Promastigotes  can  be  grown  in  a  variety  of  media  at  22-25°C.  A biphasic medium, for example Nicolle's modification of Novy and MacNeal's medium (NNN) is often used [12]. Schneider's Drosophila medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum is often more effective in primary isolation from New World cutaneous lesions. When animal or human specimens are being cultured, penicillin and streptomycin  should  be  added  with  the  inoculum  to  prevent  bacterial overgrowth. 5-Fluorocytosine can be used to inhibit fungal contamination, but amphotericin B should not be added as it may inhibit growth  of Leishmania .  Promastigotes  are  generally  found  2-7  days after inoculation of amastigotes into Schneider's medium and after 7-21 days in NNN medium.

============================================================
CHUNK 18
============================================================
THE LEISHMANIN SKIN TEST
Injection of killed promastigotes (Montenegro test) or preparations made from killed promastigotes will induce a DTH reaction in individuals with prior exposure to Leishmania .  In  most leishmanin skin test  (LST)  preparations  currently  in  use, cultured  promastigotes  are washed in 0.5% phenol saline, diluted to 1 × 10 6 /ml, and 0.1 ml is injected intradermally. Another method is to disrupt a promastigote pellet  via  sonication  or  microfluidization.  The  resulting  material  is filtered  to  remove  particulates  and  the  crude,  soluble  solution  is standardized by protein content. The injection site is examined 48 hours later and induration of ≥ 5 mm is considered a positive test. A positive LST denotes present or past infection with Leishmania .  The LST is generally positive when the lesions of cutaneous and mucosal leishmaniasis are present, but negative in active visceral leishmaniasis. Although Leishmania share common antigens with mycobacteria and trypanosomes,  the  LST  is  not  positive  in  pulmonary  tuberculosis, leprosy, African trypanosomiasis, or Chagas' disease. Occasional falsepositive reactions have been noted in patients with glandular tuberculosis and systemic fungal infections, but rigorous studies have not been done.
Although there are many different LST preparations in use worldwide, there are no licensed or available LSTs for use in the USA (as of 2012). Sensitivity, specificity and appropriate dose-ranging studies in different  geographic  settings  with  standardized  products  have  not  been performed. It is not advisable to assume that performance characteristics obtained in one area are applicable to another. For example, a study in Brazil comparing LSTs made from New World antigens to LSTs  made  from  Old  World  antigens  showed  markedly  different results in individuals with confirmed cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis. The Old World LST, containing L. major , detected only 19% of prior  cutaneous  leishmaniasis  cases,  whereas  the  New  World  LST, containing a mixture of New World parasites, detected 100% of the prior  cutaneous  leishmaniasis  cases  [13].  In  addition,  a  soluble antigen from New World L.  chagasi detected 96% of cases of prior visceral leishmaniasis, whereas an Old World LST, made from Leishmania infantum , detected 71% of cases.

DEFINITION OF CURE
Cure  or  response  to  treatment  is  defined  as  clinical  or  parasitologic.  Clinical  cure  is  the  resolution  of  the  signs  and  symptoms  of disease  within  a  defined  time  period.  For  example,  resolution  of fever  and  improved  sense  of  wellbeing  in  the  first  week  or  so  of treatment  for  visceral  leishmaniasis  accompanied  by  resolution  of anemia and splenomegaly with weight gain in the following weeks is  a  satisfactory clinical  response to treatment. Final clinical cure  is achieved with no  recurrence of symptoms  (no  relapse) at 6 months.  The  complete  epithelialization  of  an  ulcer  without  recurrence at 6 months in cutaneous leishmaniasis is a common definition  of  clinical  cure.  Achievement  of  clinical  cure  is  the  patient care goal.

============================================================
CHUNK 20
============================================================
PERSISTENCE OF VIABLE PARASITES
Successful chemotherapy leading to clinical cure does not eradicate parasites from the host. For example, viable parasites can be obtained from healed scars of New World cutaneous leishmaniasis years following successful therapy leading to clinical cure [14]. As in tuberculosis,  reactivation  of  overt  disease  following  immunosuppression results from old foci of infection that were controlled by an immune response  [15].  Recurrent  disease  in  patients  with  AIDSLeishmania co-infections  supports  the  fact  that  an  intact  immune  system  is required for sustained clinical cure.

============================================================
CHUNK 21
============================================================
VARIABILITY OF TREATMENT REGIMENS
Parasitologic  cure  refers  to  the  eradication  of Leishmania parasites which  occurs  infrequently  with  the leishmaniases. Infection is usually  life-long.  Parasitologic  response  is  often  defined  as  the decrease or absence of parasites by smear or culture within a defined time  period following  treatment.  For example,  a  splenic  aspiration may be 3 + prior to therapy and smear-negative at the end of therapy, indicating a parasitologic response. Parasitologic response endpoints are  utilized  in  research  studies  to  assess  response  to  treatment but  are  not  commonly  used  or  recommended  in  routine  clinical care.
Leishmania are a diverse group of protozoan parasites found in many different  geographic  regions  of  the  tropical  and  subtropical  world. Each  parasite  'species'  exists  within  a  unique  zoonotic  or  anthroponotic cycle. Some of these parasites infect humans and lead to a wide variety of systemic, cutaneous and mucosal clinical syndromes. Each geographic region has a unique combination of parasite strains, sandfly vectors, mammalian reservoirs and human hosts of different genetic backgrounds. A treatment regimen that is efficacious in one area may not be efficacious in another. For example, what works best for visceral leishmaniasis in India may not be optimal for East Africa [16]. Therefore, it is not possible, or desirable, to recommend a single treatment regimen that would be safe and effective for all forms of the disease in all geographic regions.

DEFINITION
Visceral leishmaniasis is a systemic illness caused by parasites of the Leishmania  donovani complex  and  characterized  by  irregular  fever, enlargement of the spleen and liver, weight loss, pancytopenia and hypergammaglobulinemia.  The  disease  is  also  known  as  Kala-azar (Hindi for black sickness).

============================================================
CHUNK 23
============================================================
ETIOLOGY
Visceral leishmaniasis is most often caused by species of the L. donovani complex: (1) Leishmania donovani sensu sticto in the Indian subcontinent; (2) Leishamania donovani sensu lato in East Africa; and, (3) Leishmania infantum found around the Mediterranean littoral, in the Middle East, Africa, China and in the Americas. New World visceral leishmaniasis was thought to be caused by a different parasite, Leishmania chagasi , but L. chagasi and L. infantum are very similar (if not identical)  and  it  is  likely  the  organism  was  imported  to  the  New World by the dogs of the conquistadors and early settlers [17]. There are no clinically useful morphologic or serologic methods for distinguishing the species, but there are differences between L. donovani and L. infantum infections in epidemiology, clinical features and responses to treatment that suggest distinct species are involved. Organisms with biochemical  characteristics  of Leishmania  tropica have  occasionally been isolated  from  bone  marrow  cultures  of  patients  with visceral leishmaniasis and 'viscerotropic leishmaniasis' in Kenya, the Middle East, and India.

============================================================
CHUNK 24
============================================================
DISTRIBUTION AND INCIDENCE
Mediterranean or infantile Kala-azar caused by L. infantum is found in Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, Greece, Yugoslavia, North Africa, the Mediterranean  islands,  Lebanon,  Iraq,  Iran,  Saudi  Arabia,  Yemen, southern Russia, central Asia, and northern China (Fig. 99.4). Indian Kala-azar occurs in the eastern part of India (Assam, Bengal, Bihar, Uttar  Pradesh,  Madras,  Sikkim),  Nepal  and  Bangladesh.  African
Kala-azar is common in Kenya, Ethiopia, and the Sudan, but sporadic cases  occur  in  Chad,  Upper  Volta,  the  Central  African  Republic, Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia, and Somalia. American Kala-azar occurs in north-eastern Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Mexico (Fig. 99.5). Reliable or current incidence figures are not available but, in 1992, the worldwide incidence of visceral leishmaniasis was estimated to be at least 100,000 per year [18].

CHUNK 25
============================================================
TRANSMISSION AND EPIDEMIOLOGY
Leishmania donovani is transmitted by phlebotomine sandflies of the genera Phlebotomus in the Old World and Lutzomyia in the New World. Regional epidemiology depends on the interaction of sandflies, reservoir hosts and susceptible humans. Visceral leishmaniasis is associated with poor nutrition and desperate poverty. Population movements of non-immune individuals into endemic areas can result in epidemics.

Humans

Domestic Dogs
Dogs  are  the  main  reservoir  for L.  infantum -associated  disease. Non-HIV-associated  disease  in  this  area  usually  occurs  in  infants and young children. Young dogs and certain breeds (foxhounds and beagles) are especially susceptible to infection with L. infantum and develop overt disease that is often fatal.

Multiple Hosts, Rodents
The epidemiology of visceral leishmaniasis in Africa is incompletely understood.  In  Kenya,  where Phlebotomus  martini is  the  probable vector, epidemics of visceral leishmaniasis occurred in the 1950s and 1970s, suggesting a human reservoir, but domestic dogs have occasionally been found infected with L. donovani . In the Sudan, between the epidemics in the 1950s and the current, ongoing, one, visceral leishmaniasis  usually  occurs  sporadically  in  nomads  who  occupy temporary villages in the dry season near patches of scrub that harbor the vector Plebotomus orientalis. Leishmania donovani has been isolated from rodents in the Sudan; rodents may be important in maintaining enzootic  foci  in  interepidemic  periods.  Parasite  isolates  from  East Africa are more closely related biochemically to L. donovani .

============================================================
CHUNK 30
============================================================
PATHOGENESIS
Following inoculation by the sandfly, promastigotes enter reticuloendothelial cells and  multiply. Parasites spread  to local lymph nodes and then, hematogenously within macrophages, to the liver, spleen, and bone marrow, resulting in a spectrum of outcomes from asymptomatic  infection  to  oligosymptomatic  disease  with  spontaneous resolution  or  disseminated  infection  and  the  clinical  syndrome  of visceral  leishmaniasis.  Patients  with  progressive  disease  develop marked splenomegaly as a result of hyperplasia of reticuloendothelial cells filled with parasites. In acute cases, the spleen is smooth and friable, but in the more usual chronic cases it is firm. Splenic infarcts are  common. The liver is usually enlarged and contains numerous amastigote-laden Kupffer cells with little, or no, surrounding cellular reaction.  In  subclinical  cases,  non-caseating  granulomas  with  few parasites  are  scattered  throughout  the  liver.  Lymph  nodes  may  be enlarged and contain macrophages filled  with amastigotes,  usually with  few  surrounding  lymphocytes.  Tonsillar  lymphoid  tissue  may also contain Leishmania . In subclinical cases or in lymphatic leishmaniasis, there is a granulomatous and giant cell reaction closely resembling tuberculosis but without caseation. In the gastrointestinal tract, there  is  proliferation  of  reticuloendothelial  cells  in  the  duodenum and  jejunum,  infiltration  of  the  submucosa  with  parasitized  cells and,  sometimes,  villous  atrophy  with  hyperplasia  of  crypt  cells. Small ulcerations may occur in which parasites can be demonstrated. The bone marrow usually contains numerous parasite-laden macrophages.  The  skin  may  contain Leishmania and,  in  fatal  cases,  all levels beneath the epidermis are often heavily infiltrated, with masses of parasitized cells concentrated around the sweat glands and arterioles.  Parasites  have  also  been  identified  in  heart  muscle  and  the adrenal glands. The kidneys may show an interstitial neph  ritis or a mild  proliferative  glomerulonephritis  and  may  contain  immune complexes. Renal amyloidosis is an uncommon late complication.

SYMPTOMS
The  incubation  period  is  generally  2-6  months,  although  disease occasionally occurs many years after the patient has left an endemic area.  The patient usually does not recall a primary skin lesion. The onset of the disease in naïve adults (migrants, soldiers, and visitors to an endemic area) is frequently acute with high fever, chills, and malaise  [19].  This  syndrome,  initially  described  early  in  the  20th century in India, is often mistaken for malaria; however, early clinicians commented that visceral leishmaniasis patients did not appear as 'toxic' as malaria patients. In endemic areas, the disease progression is described as more gradual, with intermittent fever, progressive enlargement of the spleen and liver, and vague abdominal discomfort. The initial acute illness may not be recognized. Other common symptoms include weight loss, epistaxis, diarrhea, and nonproductive cough.

============================================================
SIGNS
The  patient  is  often  weak  and  emaciated.  The  abdomen  is  usually distended by a markedly enlarged spleen and a moderately enlarged liver (Fig. 99.6). In acute visceral leishmaniasis, the spleen may not be  palpably  enlarged.  Femoral  and  inguinal  lymphadenopathy  is often noted, especially in African visceral leishmaniasis, and generalized  lymphadenopathy  is  a  feature  of  lymphatic  leishmaniasis. Trophic changes of the hair (thinning, dryness, hypopigmentation, and loss of curl) and of the skin on the lower legs are common. Heart murmurs are often present and edema of the legs, jaundice, petechiae, and purpura may sometimes be noted. Mucosal lesions are occasionally seen in patients with visceral leishmaniasis in the Sudan and rarely in patients from East Africa and India. Oral lesions appear as nodules or ulcers of the gum, palate, tongue, or lip. Lesions of the nasal mucosa may cause perforation of the septum. Nasopharyngeal and laryngeal lesions present with mucosal swelling and hoarseness. These lesions may be associated with active visceral infections or with post-Kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). They respond to therapy and may be caused by an exaggerated, nonhealing immune response. Uncommon presenting syndromes, which precede the development of overt visceral leishmaniasis, include bacteremia, acute hepatitis and GuillainBarré syndrome. Only after the classic signs and symptoms of visceral leishmaniasis  develop  are  these  unusual  (or  uncommonly  recognized) manifestations of visceral leishmaniasis associated with Leishmania infection.  In  addition,  uncommon  systemic  manifestations associated  with  overt  visceral  leishmaniasis  include  retinal  hemorrhages, massive hepatic necrosis, pancytopenia without splenomegaly, cholecystitis and distal extremity paresthesias. Lymphatic leishmaniasis also occurs not infrequently. Both generalized and regional adenopathy with, and without, systemic symptoms may occur. Leishmania infection  is  an  uncommon,  treatable  cause  of  secondary

Hematologic
Hemoglobin  concentrations  of  5-9 g/dl,  white  blood  cell  (WBC) counts of 2000-4000/mm 3 and platelet counts of 50,000-200,000/ mm 3  are typical, although much lower counts are sometimes seen in
advanced disease [22]. The anemia is multifactorial. Erthrocyte survival  time  is  shortened  owing  to  hypersplenism  and  possibly  to autoimmune mechanisms. Bone marrow depression is indicated by a reticulocytosis lower than expected for the degree of anemia. Coexistent  iron  deficiency  may  be  present.  The  Coombs  test  is  usually positive, with both C3 and lgG present on red blood cells, but does not correlate with the severity of the anemia. The neutrophil survival time is shortened and the WBC differential demonstrates neutropenia, relative lymphocytosis, and an almost complete absence of eosinophils. Agranulocytosis is rare.

Other
Liver transaminases (alanine transaminase [ALT] more than aspartate transaminase [AST]) are mildly elevated in the majority of patients, but elevations of serum bilirubin are uncommon. The prothrombin time is usually 2-4 seconds longer than that in controls, and serum albumin is generally less than 3 g/dl. A polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia of 5-10 g/dl, most of which is lgG, is usual. In some reports, albuminuria is common, but in others the urinalysis is normal, as are tests of renal function.

============================================================
COMPLICATIONS
Bacterial pneumonia may be present on admission or may develop during  treatment.  Pulmonary  tuberculosis  and  HIV  are  common co-infections, and it should be suspected in any patient responding poorly to specific antiLeishmania therapy. Cancrum oris, a necrotizing oral infection, occurs late in the course when neutropenia is severe. Hepatic cirrhosis is an uncommon sequela of visceral leishmaniasis and portal hypertension may cause persistent splenomegaly, despite successful treatment of Kala-azar. Post-Kala-azar anterior uveitis can occur after treatment for visceral leishmaniasis. Patients present with deteriorating  visual  acuity  -  slit  lamp  examination  shows  irregular nodules  in  the  iris.  Other  rare  ocular  complications  reported  are retinal hemorrhages, keratitis, central retinal vein thrombosis, papillitis,  and  iritis.  Disseminated  intravascular  coagulation,  immune complex-mediated  glomerulonephritis  and  renal  amyloidosis  presenting  with  a  nephrotic  syndrome  are  also  rarely  seen.  Death  in patients  with  visceral  leishmaniasis  is  often  associated  with,  and perhaps caused by, concurrent infections, for example tuberculosis, dysentery,  measles,  and  bacterial  pneumonias.  Deaths  caused  by cardiac failure in severely anemic persons also occur.

============================================================
SUBCLINICAL OR OLIGOSYMPTOMATIC INFECTIONS
In areas endemic for visceral leishmaniasis, many inhabitants develop a positive skin test without a history of overt clinical disease - such individuals appear to be resistant to naturally occurring and experimental infection with L. donovani . The difference between true asymptomatic infection and oligosymptomatic disease is difficult to establish in most endemic areas because the etiology of nonspecific illness is rarely diagnosed and does not warrant evaluation in the context of the culture and healthcare infrastructure. For example, in a prospective study in Brazil, 28 out of 86 children with antibodies to L. donovani developed  classic  visceral  leishmaniasis  within  a  few  weeks  to  15 months after seroconversion. Twenty others remained asymptomatic during observation for up to 5 years and 38 had a prolonged 'subclinical'  illness,  manifested  by  mild  constitutional  symptoms  and intermittent  hepatomegaly  that  resolved  without  anti-leishmanial treatment after an average of 35 months [23]. Other reports of nonspecific,  chronic  illness,  associated  with  'viscerotropic' Leishmania infection have come from Italy [24] and Saudi Arabia [25, 26]. One patient presented more than 2 years after the last possible exposure. These relatively mild, nonspecific illnesses are characterized by cough, malaise, chronic fatigue, abdominal pain, and intermittent fevers and diarrhea  and  have  been  parasitologically  confirmed  from  bone marrow or lymph node aspirates and are likely more common than currently appreciated. Therefore, 'viscerotropic' leishmaniasis should be considered in individuals with unexplained constitutional complaints in endemic areas or in travelers with a history of exposure.

INFECTIONS IN IMMUNOCOMPROMISED HOSTS
Prior  to  the  routine  use  of  modern  anti-retroviral  therapy  for  HIV infection, Leishmania was  a  significant  opportunistic  infection  in patients with AIDS. Co-infection with Leishmania and HIV is a recognized problem in the Southern Mediterranean and has been reported in 20 other countries [27]. As the incidence of HIV infection increases in  India,  Brazil,  and  East  Africa,  the  numbers  of  people  at  risk  of co-infection will also increase dramatically.
Clinical signs and symptoms of visceral leishmaniasis usually occur as a late-stage manifestation in patients with AIDS. CD4 T lymphocyte counts, when reported, are usually less than 50 mm 3 and are almost always  less  than  200 mm 3 .  In  general,  patients  with  overt  disease associated with visceral leishmaniasis have very high parasite burdens but seem to tolerate the parasite co-infection reasonably well. Many clinicians believe that Leishmania does not cause severe symptoms in these patients but rather is just one more of the many opportunistic infections that plague patients with severely depressed CD4 counts. Numerous viscerotropic, dermotropic and novel L.  infantum zymodemes have been isolated from co-infected patients in Europe.
The clinical presentation of visceral leishmaniasis in AIDS patients is similar to the presentation in non-HIV-infected hosts. Fever, splenomegaly and pancytopenia are common. Involvement of the gastrointestinal tract is more common  in AIDS patients. Abundant parasite-laden  macrophages  are  found  in  the  submucosa  from  the esophagus to the rectum. Co-infected patients may have atypical presentations that include a variety of pulmonary syndromes, for example pleural  effusion  and  pulmonary  nodules.  Afebrile  patients  with minimal splenomegaly have also been reported.
The principles of diagnosis in HIV-co-infected patients are not different. The parasite burden tends to be higher and serologic tests may be  negative;  therefore,  classic  parasitologic  methods  are  preferable. Fever  or  hepatosplenomegaly  in  an  HIV-infected  patient  who  has resided  in,  or  visited,  an  area  endemic  for  visceral  leishmaniasis should  prompt  an  examination  of  the  bone  marrow  with  both smears, cultures, and PCR for Leishmania .

INFECTIONS IN IMMUNOCOMPROMISED HOSTS
Visceral leishmaniasis may also occur as an opportunistic infection in immunocompromised  patients  associated  with  solid  organ  (renal, heart)  transplantation  [28],  persons  receiving  immunosuppressive therapy  [29,  30]  and  chronic  corticosteroid  use  [3 1].  Unexplained fever,  splenomegaly  and  cytopenias  in  an  immunocompromised patient with an appropriate exposure history should prompt consideration of leishmaniasis. Standard parasitologic diagnostic methods are usually sufficient. The problem is almost always a failure to consider the diagnosis.

============================================================
POST=KALA=AZAR DERMAL LEISHMANIASIS (PKDL)
PKDL is a cutaneous syndrome seen following the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis, usually with pentavalent antimony [32, 33]. The syndrome consists of macules and papules first occurring around the mouth and spreading to the rest of the face and, to a lesser extent, on the extensor surfaces of the arms, the trunk and, occasionally, the legs. Initially, they appear as small hypopigmented patches, which enlarge and may progress to nodules that sometimes resemble leprosy.
PKDL occurs in up to 20% of patients with visceral leishmaniasis in India, with skin lesions usually appearing 2-10 years after successful treatment of visceral leishmaniasis. PKDL has been reported in over 50%  of  Sudanese  visceral  leishmaniasis  patients  treated  and  the lesions often appear within a few months of treatment. In the Sudan, onset of PKDL was reported to occur at a mean of 56 days (range: 0-180 days) (Fig. 99.7).
Histologically, there is a spectrum of cellular response, varying from numerous parasites with few inflammatory cells to a granulomatous reaction  containing  few  parasites.  Parasites  isolated  from  patients

with PKDL are serologically and biochemically identical to L. donovani isolated from patients with visceral leishmaniasis. Because the lesions of PKDL may persist for up to 20 years, such patients may act as a chronic reservoir of infection.

CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS
A clinical diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis can be made with varying degrees of certainty depending on the local epidemiologic factors and clinical presentation The positive predictive value of a clinical diagnosis of late-stage visceral leishmaniasis, with classic signs and symptoms,  in  an  endemic  area  is  likely  to  be  very  high.  Although  a confirmatory  parasitologic  diagnosis  is  preferable  prior  to  starting treatment, in settings where safely performing an invasive procedure is  difficult,  a  presumptive  diagnosis  can  be  made  when  clinical improvement  in  response  to  appropriate  therapy  is  seen  within  a week or so. A clinical diagnosis early in the course of infection when the  classic  features  of  disease  are  not  yet  established  is  much  less certain.

============================================================
DEMONSTRATION OF PARASITES
Specimens can be obtained from the bone marrow, liver, spleen, or enlarged lymph nodes. Splenic aspiration has the highest sensitivity. In  experienced  hands,  the  procedure  is  safe  and  well  tolerated; however, deaths have occurred after splenic  aspiration, presumably owing to splenic laceration - careful observation after the procedure is mandatory [34, 35]. Contraindications to splenic aspiration are a soft  spleen  in  acute  disease,  a  prothrombin  time ≥ 5  seconds  compared  with  the  normal  control,  or  a  platelet  count  below  40,000/ mm 3 . The procedure uses a 21-gauge needle attached to a 5-ml syringe, which is inserted just under the skin over the middle of the spleen or via an intercostal approach if the  spleen is  minimally enlarged. As suction is applied, the needle is rapidly inserted into the spleen and withdrawn, with the needle remaining in the spleen only a fraction of  a  second.  The  small  amount of  splenic  tissue  and  blood  in  the needle  is  expressed  into  culture  medium  and  onto  slides  for  thin smears.  Splenic  smears  stained  with  Giemsa  or  Leishman's  stain demonstrate amastigotes in > 95% of cases. Splenic smears are often quantitated  by  the  method  of  Chulay  and  Bryceson  to  assist  in response to therapy [36].
Bone marrow aspiration is preferred in many areas because of concern about the hazards of  splenic  aspiration  and  unfamiliarity  with  the technique.  Bone  marrow  smears  usually  contain  relatively  fewer amastigotes, and parasites are found in only 50-85% of cases compared with splenic aspirates. Amastigotes are also frequently found in aspirates or biopsies of liver specimens or lymph nodes. Buffy coat smears can demonstrate amastigotes in Indian and Kenyan Kala-azar, but it is unusual to make the diagnosis by this method.
The confirmation of visceral leishmaniasis is usually not difficult, as it is a polyparasitic syndrome; however, the parasite burden in early disease in non-immunes or in those with hemophagocytic syndrome can be very light and more sensitive techniques such as culture and PCR are needed [37]. PCR amplification of Leishmania DNA from liver and bone marrow are routinely reported.

============================================================
SEROLOGIC TESTS
High-titer anti-leishmanial antibodies are present in visceral leishmaniasis and can be detected by ELISA, immunofluorescence, and direct agglutination. Sensitivity and specificity vary based on the antigens used in the assay and the infecting parasites. Whole promastigotes, crude promastigote lysates and recombinant antigens are in use. In general, current serologic tests for visceral leishmaniasis have sensitivities > 90% but with lower specificities. False-positive results, especially with  lower  titers,  can  be  seen  in  malaria,  trypanosomiasis,  tuberculosis,  enteric  fever,  and  schistosomiasis.  In  addition,  antibodies may  persist  for  many  months  following  treatment  for  visceral leishmaniasis.
The  ELISA  test  using  whole,  soluble  promastigote  or  recombinant antigens appears as sensitive and specific as the indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFA) and, because of economy and technical practicality, it  is especially useful for large-scale epidemiologic studies. Both the IFA and ELISA can be performed on sera eluted from filter papers impregnated with 50 μ l of capillary blood.
The IFA is positive in more than 95% of patients with visceral leishmaniasis,  generally  with  titers  above  1:256.  Whole,  culture-derived promastigotes are fixed in wells of a special glass slide. Serum at different dilutions is applied to the wells. Antibodies in the serum that bind to surface antigens on the promastigotes are then detected by an antibody to  the  Ig  molecule  conjugated  to  a  fluorescent  marker.  A microscopist reports a titer (the reciprocal of the dilution) that corresponds to a certain percentage of parasites that fluoresce. IFA testing is somewhat subjective and requires rigorous technique and relatively expensive equipment.

============================================================
CHUNK 45
============================================================
SEROLOGIC TESTS
The direct agglutination test (DAT) is based on direct agglutination of L. donovani promastigotes that react specifically with anti-leishmania antibodies in the serum specimen resulting in agglutination of the promastigotes.  Serial,  twofold  dilutions  (starting  1:100)  from  the serum samples, are made in a V-shaped microtiter plate. The antigen is added and the plates are read the next day. Agglutination is visible as a blue/purple mat in the wells of the microtiter plate. The freezedried  antigen  is  available  from  the  Royal  Tropical  Institute  (KIT) Biomedical Research in Amsterdam, The Netherlands (http:// www.kit.nl/-/INS/52859/Royal-Tropical-Institute) and can be stored at ambient temperature for at least 2 years. After reconstitution of the antigen in saline and storage at 4°C, the antigen can be used at least for a week. DAT test sensitivity and specificity estimates were 94.8% (95%  confidence  interval  92.7-96.4%)  and  85.9%  (72.3-93.4%), respectively, in a meta-analysis [38].
The recombinant protein rK39 is used as the capture antigen in ELISA tests and in point-of-care, dipstick-type, rapid diagnostic tests to detect antibodies in the serum of patients with visceral leishmaniasis. In the

============================================================

SEROLOGIC TESTS
same meta-analysis, the rK39 test sensitivity and specificity were very similar to the DAT at 93.9% (87.7-97.1%) and 90.6% (66.8-97.9%) respectively [38]. Sensitivity is higher and more homogeneous in the studies carried out in South Asia and the specificity varies depending on the choice of controls. Quantitative titers to rK39 determined by ELISA also decrease following successful chemotherapy and tend to rise in cases of relapse, making it useful for the recognition of treatment failures. In the rapid assays,  the  rK39  antigen is  striped  onto nitrocellulose  paper  and  a  drop  of  whole  blood  is  placed  onto  a sample  pad  with  immunolabeled  gold.  Human  lgG  binds  to  the labeled  gold  and  migrates  up  the  strip.  If  antibodies  to  rK39  are present in the serum, they bind to the rK389 antigen stripe giving a visual positive  test result. A Food and Drug Administration (FDA)cleared rK39 assay is commercially available (Kalazar Detect™, Inbios International  Inc.,  Seattle,  WA,  USA;  http://www.inbios.com/rapidtests/kalazar-detect). The rK39 test is not useful in screening asymptomatic individuals for infection but should be used in individuals with a compatible clinical syndrome.

The Leishmanin skin test (LST) test is almost uniformly negative in active visceral leishmaniasis but becomes positive in 90% of patients 6 weeks to 1 year after recovery.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The differential diagnosis of late-stage visceral leishmaniasis is limited. Hematologic  and  lymphatic  malignancies,  disseminated  histoplasmosis and hepatosplenic schistomiasis have rarely been reported to mimic  late-stage  visceral  leishmaniasis.  Early  disease  has  a  much broader differential  that  includes  malaria,  African  trypanosomiasis, brucellosis,  enteric  fevers,  bacterial  endocarditis,  generalized  histoplasmosis, chronic myelocytic leukemia, Hodgkin disease and other lymphomas, sarcoidosis, hepatic cirrhosis, and tuberculosis. Tropical splenomegaly syndrome is especially difficult to differentiate, although  high  titers  of  antimalarial  antibodies  and  a  characteristic histologic appearance of the liver suggest this disease. Patients with multiple  myeloma  and  Waldenströ m's  macroglobulinemia  have monoclonal hypergammaglobulinemia.

Patients  should receive  a  nutritious  diet,  as  patients  are  often  malnourished. Antimicrobial agents are given when concurrent pneumonia, tuberculosis or other bacterial infections are suspected.

SPECIFIC ANTI-LEISHMANIAL THERAPY
Pentavalent antimony compounds (SbV) have historically been the drugs of choice for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis worldwide since  their  introduction  in  the  mid-1930s.  However,  reports  of primary treatment failures with SbV in India became more prevalent in the mid-1990s leading to trials of amphotericin B compounds as initial therapy for both Mediterranean and Indian visceral leishmaniasis. Currently, many favor the use of liposomal amphotericin B as first-line  therapy  for  visceral  leishmaniasis.  SbV  remains  efficacious when given at appropriate doses in East Africa and the Americas.

PENTAVALENT ANTIMONIALS $SbV%
There are two widely available commercial SbV formulations: sodium stibogluconate  (SSG;  Pentostam®,  GlaxoSmithKline,  UK)  largely used  in  English-speaking  countries  and  meglumine  antimoniate
(Glucantime®,  Sanofi-Aventis,  Suzano,  Brazil)  commonly  used  in Latin America and French-speaking parts of Africa and Europe. There are numerous local and regional manufacturers around the world of SSG and other SbV formulations. It is not known how these different preparations compare with each other in terms of safety and efficacy, as  no  comparative  trials  have  ever  been  performed.  However,  it  is unwise to assume one preparation will perform the same as another or  have  the  same  safety  and  tolerability  profile.  Deaths  have  been associated with the use of generic SbV and every batch of generic SSG should be subject to rigorous quality control prior to use [39].
SbV can be administered intravenously or intramuscularly. There is variation in the total antimony (Sb) content, the proportion of SbV to trivalent Sb (trivalent Sb is much more toxic than SbV), and the physical and chemical characteristics of different lots of SbV from the same manufacturer and between preparations from different manufacturers. Many investigators believe these lot variations are responsible  for  the  different  safety  and  efficacy  profiles  observed  in  treated patients. Several cardiac deaths in India were associated with use of a SbV preparation with high osmolarity [40]. In addition, SbV dissociates or polymerizes over time, so storage conditions and shelf-life are important considerations. Storage at 4°C in the dark is optimal.
In  the  USA,  Pentostam®  is  available  from  the  Centers  for  Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC) under an investigational new  drug (IND) application. The recommended treatment regimen for visceral leishmaniasis is 20 mg of SbV/kg/day given intravenously for 28 days. Undiluted  intravenous  injections  are  not  recommended.  The  daily dose can be given as 1:10 dilution with 5% D/W to reduce the incidence of local thrombosis through a steel butterfly needle placed and removed daily. In endemic areas, the intramuscular route of administration is more common although the large-volume injections are moderately painful.

PENTAVALENT ANTIMONIALS $SbV%
SbV drugs are safe, although with a poorly tolerated side effect profile. Nausea,  anorexia,  abdominal  pain,  malaise,  headache,  arthralgias, myalgias, and lethargy are frequent, beginning about 7-10 days into therapy  [41].  These  side  effects  are  more  noticeable  in  cutaneous leishmaniasis and mucosal leishmaniasis patients, as they do not have systemic symptoms associated with their disease. In general, visceral leishmaniasis  patients  seem  to  tolerate  SbV  better  than  cutaneous leishmaniasis or mucosal leishmaniasis patients. In particular, large joint arthralgias  can be quite problematic. Fortunately, these symptoms resolve shortly after therapy is complete.
Shortly  after  beginning  therapy,  patients  treated  with  SbV  preparations develop elevations in serum amylase and serum lipase, lipase greater than amylase, which peak at 7-14 days [42]. Although most are  asymptomatic,  many  develop  some degree  of  anorexia,  nausea and  mid-epigastric  pain  consistent  with  pancreatitis.  Lipase  and amylase levels return to normal despite continuing the drug.
Deaths attributed to pancreatic necrosis have been reported in patients receiving SbV; therefore, monitoring of serum amylase and lipase in patients is recommended. When patients develop symptoms or signs of  pancreatitis,  it  is  recommended  that  SSG  be  temporarily  halted for  a  few  days. Serum amylase and lipase rapidly return to normal and  the  regimen  can  then  usually  be  completed  without  another interruption. Even in asymptomatic patients, it is reasonable to temporarily interrupt therapy for significant elevations of serum amylase or lipase.

Anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia associated with hypoplasia of the bone marrow have all been seen during SbV therapy and are  occasionally  severe  enough  to  interrupt  therapy.  Abnormalities reverse on discontinuation of the drug. Again, baseline values prior to  treatment  and  monitoring  during  therapy  are  recommended  if feasible. Transient increases in serum transaminases are also seen in the  majority  of  patients  during  treatment.  AST  levels  rise  three-  to fourfold above the upper limit of normal between days 7 and 14 but decline despite continued therapy. Renal tubular acidosis and acute renal  failure  associated  with  SbV  have  been  reported.  SSG  causes lymphopenia that has been associated with occasional cases of herpes zoster occurring during the course of treatment.
Electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities, including nonspecific STand T-wave changes and T-wave flattening or inversion, occur in more than half of patients receiving SSG; the frequency of these changes is proportional to the total daily dose and the duration of therapy [43]. Torsades de pointes with prolonged QT intervals and syncopal episodes have also been reported. An ECG should be obtained prior to therapy  and  repeated  weekly  for  standard  doses;  if  doses  above 20 mg/kg/day are considered, more frequent ECG monitoring should be considered. Treatment should be suspended if the corrected QT interval (the measured QT interval divided by the square root of the RR interval) becomes prolonged beyond 0.50 seconds. T-wave flattening or inversion, the most common ECG abnormality during antimony administration, is not an indication to stop treatment [44].

CHUNK 54
============================================================
AMPHOTERICIN B
Amphotricin B deoxycholate was successfully introduced to treat cases of visceral leishmaniasis that failed to respond to SbV in the 1990s, especially  in  India.  The  regimen  is  1 mg/kg  administered  by  slow intravenous infusion over 4-6 hours every 2 days, until a total dose of about 20 mg/kg has been given. Although some initiate treatment with an incremental escalation of doses in an attempt to decrease the infusion-related side effects of amphotericin B, a clinical trial of 120 Indian patients with visceral leishmaniasis showed no difference in infusion-related side effects between those receiving the incremental dose and those receiving 1 mg/kg from day 1 [45]. The widespread use of amphotericin B deoxycholate has been hindered because of the well-known infusion-related  side  effects  of  fever,  chills  and  thrombophlebitis, long-term problems of renal insufficiency, anemia and hypokalemia, and poor tolerability (anorexia, nausea). Also, amphotericin B deoxycholate should be used with caution in those previously receiving SbV. Sudden cardiac death has been reported following the first dose of amphotericin B deoxycholate in these patients. It is thought  that  the  ECG  abnormalities  associated  with  SbV  therapy predispose to cardiac events  [46]. It  seems  prudent  to  recommend that a baseline ECG be obtained and a rest period be observed until the ECG normalizes, usually within 10 days of the end of SbV therapy, and any electrolyte abnormalities be corrected before starting amphotericin B deoxycholate.
The desire  to  develop less toxic  and  more effective preparations of amphotericin B to treat systemic mycoses led to the introduction of lipid-associated amphotericin B preparations in the mid-1990s. Liposomal  amphotericin  B  (LAMB)  (AmBisome®,  Astellas  Pharma  US, Inc.,  USA)  was  approved  in  1997  by the  FDA for  the  treatment  of visceral leishmaniasis [47, 48].

AMPHOTERICIN B
LAMB has been shown in a series of trials to be a very effective and safe drug for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis acquired in Brazil, India, Kenya, and the Mediterranean [16, 49-51]. The current FDAapproved  regimen  for  immunocompetent  patients,  based  on  data from the Mediterranean and Brazil, is 3 mg/kg daily on days 1-5, a sixth dose on day 14 and a seventh dose on day 21 (total dose with this regimen is 21 mg/kg). Overall success rate with this dose regimen is practically 100%. Lower-dose regimens have been effective in trials from Brazil, India, and Kenya. A dose of 3-4 mg/kg daily on days 1-5 with a sixth dose on day 10 is probably adequate for visceral leishmaniasis  acquired  in  the  Mediterranean  and  Brazil,  and  a  dose  of 2-3 mg/kg daily on days 1-5 and a sixth dose on day 10 for visceral leishmaniasis acquired in East Africa and India. Culminating a series of investigations spanning a decade, Indian investigators have shown that  a  single  10 mg/kg  dose  of  LAMB  was > 95%  efficacious  [5 1]. Lower-dose regimens may have a somewhat lower efficacy than the near  100%  reported  with  the  higher-dose  regimen,  but  the  cost savings and decreased potential for infusion-related side effects may make a lower-dose regimen optimal for some geographic regions. The current FDA-approved regimen for immunosuppressed patients is a higher-dose regimen of 4 mg/kg daily on days 1-5, 10, 17, 24, 31 and 38 (total dose of 40 mg/kg). Even with the higher total dose, relapse is common in immunocompromised patients. For the rare cases of visceral leishmaniasis treated in the non-endemic areas, LAMB is the recommended drug and should be used unless contraindicated.

============================================================
PAROMOMYCIN
Paromomycin is an aminoglycoside with broad anti-parasitic activity. Parenteral paromomycin used as monotherapy has been shown to be effective in Indian visceral leishmaniasis at a dose of 15 mg/kg paromomycin sulfate (1 1 mg base) given intramuscularly for 21 days for a cure rate of 93-95% [52]. The efficacy was shown to be 85% in East Africa at an increased dose of 20 mg/kg (15 mg base) per day for 21 days [53]. There is no experience with this drug in L. infantum foci (Mediterranean, South America). Mild pain at the injection site is the commonest adverse event (55%). Reversible ototoxicity occurs in 2% of patients. Occasional elevated hepatic enzyme concentrations and rare renal toxicity and tetany have been reported.

============================================================
CHUNK 57
============================================================
MILTEFOSINE
Miltefosine was originally developed as an oral anticancer drug but was later shown to have anti-leishmanial activity. Miltefosine commonly induces gastrointestinal side-effects such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting (38%), and diarrhea (20%). Most episodes are brief and resolve as treatment is continued. Occasionally, the side effects can be severe  and  require  interruption  of  treatment.  Skin  allergy,  elevated hepatic transaminase concentrations  and,  rarely, renal insufficiency may  be  observed.  Miltefosine  should  be  taken  after  meals  and,  if multiple doses are to be taken, they should be divided. Miltefosine is potentially teratogenic and should not be used by pregnant women or women with child-bearing potential for whom adequate contraception cannot be assured for the duration of  treatment and for 3 months afterwards. Miltfosine is given at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg per day for 28 days to children aged 2-1 1 years and for people aged 12 years and above at a dose of 50 mg/day for those weighing < 25 kg, 100 mg/ day  for  25-50 kg  body  weight  and  150 mg/day  for > 50 kg  body weight for 28 days, has shown a 95% cure rate in immunocompetent patients in India [54, 55] and about 90% in Ethiopia [56].

============================================================
COMBINATION TREATMENT
The  use  of  long-duration  monotherapy  in  unsupervised  settings  is concerning  for  the  risk  of  developing  resistance  to  established  or newly introduced drugs, especially in anthroponotic foci. The current World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  policy  is  to  limit  the  use  of monotherapy to liposomal LAMB [57].
Combination treatment has the potential advantages of shortening the duration of treatment, reducing the overall dose of medicines and reducing the probability of selection of drug-resistant parasites which will  improve  compliance,  reduce  drug  toxicities,  lower  costs  and prolong the effective life of the available medicines.
Several trials of combinations have been conducted, with favorable results. A combination of paromomycin and antimonials resulted in a  higher  cure  rate  in  visceral  leishmaniasis  patients  in  Bihar,  India than antimonials alone, to which lack of response was common. In East Africa, the combination of sodium stibogluconate at 20 mg/kg SbV + plus paromomycin given at 15 mg/kg (1 1-mg base) for 17 days showed an efficacy of 93%. The safety and efficacy of the combination treatment  and  sodium  stibogluconate  alone  were  similar.  Furthermore, there were no differences in the efficacy  of the combination treatment  in  Ethiopia,  Kenya,  and  the  Sudan,  suggesting  that  this regimen could be used across the region. In several phase 3 studies in India, three separate combinations showed 98-99% cure rates. The treatment included two sequential administrations, with either liposomal amphotericin B (5 mg/kg, single infusion) plus 7 days' miltefosine  (dosage  as  above)  or  liposomal  amphotericin  B  (5 mg/kg, single  infusion)  plus  10  days'  paromomycin  (1 1-mg/kg  base),  and co-adminstration of 10 days' miltefosine plus 10 days' paromomycin (dose as above). No safety issues were recorded.

============================================================
TREATMENT OF RELAPSES
Relapse usually occurs within 6 months of the end of treatment, often within a few months. Persistent splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia
are useful prognostic indicators. Co-infection with tuberculosis and HIV should be considered in those who fail to respond or relapse. Successful  treatment  of  coexisting  tuberculosis  usually  results  in response of the visceral leishmaniasis. Patients who fail to respond or relapse after initial  therapy should  be  treated with  a  different  drug regimen.  For  example,  if  a  visceral  leishmaniasis  patient  fails  to respond to liposomal amphotericin B, then a trial of SbV could begin. Additional doses, or higher doses, of the same regimen could be tried, but only under close supervision.

CHUNK 60
============================================================
SPLENECTOMY
Splenectomy  is  rarely  indicated  in  patients  with  visceral  leishmaniasis.  The  more  common  dilemma  is  inadvertent  splenectomy because of failure to consider the diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis [58]. Patients with a protracted clinical course and frequent relapses who are resistant  to  treatment  and develop  severe  cytopenias with massive splenomegaly may require splenectomy. The use of elective splenectomy  is  effective  for  restoring  the  hematologic  parameters and reduces the need for blood transfusions, but it does not avoid relapsing  visceral  leishmaniasis.  There  is  usually  a  prompt  rise  in hemoglobin levels and WBC and platelet counts after splenectomy, but  additional  chemotherapy  is  necessary,  or  cure  is  unlikely  [59]. Splenectomized  patients  are  at  increased  risk  of  overwhelming sepsis because of penumococci and other encapsulated bacteria and should  receive  anti-pneumococcal  vaccination  before  splenectomy. Because  malaria  is  often  fatal  in  splenectomized  individuals,  lifelong anti-malarial prophylaxis is essential in countries where malaria occurs.

POST-KALA-AZAR DERMAL LEISHMANIASIS $PKDL%
Treatment  of  PKDL  depends  on  the  severity  of  the  condition  in individual  patients.  In  Bangladesh,  India,  and  Nepal  either  an extended  regimen  of  amphotericin  B  deoxycholate  at  1 mg/kg  per day by infusion (20 days on, 20 days off), up to 60-80 doses over 4 months or miltefosine orally at 50 mg three times daily for 60 days or twice daily for 90 days for 12 weeks is recommended. Disappearance of the lesion is considered clinical cure. In East Africa, PKDL is not routinely treated, as the majority of cases (85%) heal spontaneously within a year. Only patients with severe or disfiguring disease, those  with  lesions  that  have  remained  for  longer  than  6  months, those  with  concomitant  anterior  uveitis  and  young  children  with oral  lesions  that  interfere  with  feeding  are  treated.  Treatment  with either SSG at 20 mg/kg SbV + per day for up to 2 months or a 20-day course of liposomal amphotericin B at 2.5 mg/kg per day is recommended. Clinical cure is defined as flattening of lesions and improvement  of  dyschromia,  although  pigmentary  changes  may  persist indefinitely.

CHUNK 62
============================================================
HIV CO-INFECTION
Response to initial treatment with pentavalent antimony is only 50%, whereas  response  to  liposomal  amphotericin  B  is  near  100%. However, relapse is common after both drugs. The optimal induction therapeutic regimen, including choice of drug, dose and duration for different infecting parasites is not known. Optimal intermittent maintenance regimens are likewise unknown. Currently, immune system reconstitution through highly active anti-retrovial therapy (HAART) is the optimal therapy, where feasible. It is reasonable to recommend an initial  course  of  induction  therapy  using  LAMB to  decrease  the parasite  burden  closely  followed  by  HAART  to  raise  the  CD4  cell count.

============================================================
CHUNK 63
============================================================
PREGNANCY
Treatment of pregnant women is always a risk-benefit assessment. The possibility of a fatal outcome of leishmaniasis for the mother, the fetus and the newborn is much greater than the risk for adverse drug effects. When untreated, spontaneous abortion, small-for-birth date and  congenital  leishmaniasis  have  been  described  [60].  SbV  and miltefosine should not be used in pregnancy [57, 61]. Miltefosine is potentially  embryotoxic  and  teratogenic  and  should  not  be  used during pregnancy. Women of child-bearing age should be tested for pregnancy  before  treatment  and  use  effective  contraception  for  3 months after treatment.
Amphotericin  B  deoxycholate  and  LAMB  are  the  best  therapeutic options for visceral leishmaniasis. No abortions or vertical transmission have been reported in mothers treated with liposomal amphotericin B [61, 62].

============================================================
CHUNK 64
============================================================
PROGNOSIS
Infection  with L.  donovani comprises  a  spectrum  of  diseases,  and spontaneous cure of inapparent infection is more common than was formerly realized. In  contrast,  the  established  syndrome  of  visceral leishmaniasis  is  almost  always  fatal  in  the  absence  of  specific chemotherapy.
Response to treatment should be monitored by daily assessment of sense of wellbeing, appetite, temperature and weekly assessment of hemoglobin, platelet and neutrophil counts, body weight and spleen size. Repeat splenic or bone marrow aspirates to document parasitologic improvement are not routinely indicated in the face of clinical improvement.  In  most  patients,  the  fever  disappears  within  days, appetite  returns  and  the  patient  feels  better.  The  hemoglobin  level rises and the spleen becomes smaller within 2 weeks, although return to baseline size may not occur until months after therapy. When fever persists and the general condition does not improve during treatment, concomitant  tuberculosis  or  HIV  infection  should  be  suspected. Within 6-12 months, the spleen usually becomes non-palpable, and elevated immunoglobulin levels and serologic tests become normal. Persistent splenomegaly after otherwise successful treatment may be caused by portal hypertension.
Follow-up examination is important for the early detection and treatment of relapses. Relapse is suggested by an increase in spleen size, a fall in hemoglobin levels, and a decrease in eosinophil counts to fewer than  50/mm 3 and  should  be  confirmed  by  the  demonstration  of parasites.  Relapses  are  most  common  during  the  first  2-6  months after  finishing  treatment  but,  occasionally,  they  occur  several  years later, particularly in patients who become immunocompromised by disease or medication.

RESERVOIR CONTROL
Zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (ZVL) caused by Leishmania infantum is  an  important disease of  humans and dogs. Transmission among dogs can be maintained by non-sandfly routes, such as congenital and sexual transmission, as well as between dogs by sandfly transmission. Dogs are the only confirmed primary reservoir of infection. Review of intervention  studies  examining  the  effectiveness  of  current  control methods highlights the lack of randomized controlled trials of both dog  culling  and  residual  insecticide  spraying.  Topical  insecticides (deltamethrin-impregnated collars and pour-ons) have been shown to provide a high level of individual protection to treated dogs, but further community-level studies are needed [64].

In India, during the early part of the 20th century, houses known to be microfoci were burned.

Cutaneous leishmaniasis of the Old World is characterized by chronic slow-to-heal  ulcerative  and  nodular  skin  lesions.  Uncommon  syndromes in the  Old World include  diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis, mucocutaneous  leishmaniasis  and  leishmaniasis  recidivans.  Local names for this disease include Oriental sore, Baghdad boil, Delhi boil, Biskra button, and Aleppo evil.

ETIOLOGY
Most Old World cutaneous leishmaniasis is caused by infections with Leishmania  tropica and Leishmania  major and  less  commonly  with Leishmania aethiopica , Leishmania infantum , and Leishmania killicki that are often geographically focal diseases.

In  established  transmission  foci,  cutaneous  leishmaniasis  is a  childhood  disease  with  increasing  prevalence  with  age  to  about the  mid-teenage  years.  Adults  have  acquired  immunity  and  are seldom  affected.  In  newly  emerging  foci,  all  individuals  are  nonimmune and  significant  epidemics  with  very  high  attack  rates  are common [66].

============================================================
LEISHMANIA MAJOR
Leishmaniasis  major is  a  zoonotic  infection  of  desert  rodents  with humans  infected  as  incidental  hosts.  The  great  gerbil  ( Rhombomys opimus) lives in dry desert areas of central Asia, in southern Russia, throughout Iran and Pakistan, and in parts of Iraq and north-western India and China. These gerbils may have an infection rate as high as 30%,  with  cutaneous  lesions  on  relatively  hairless  parts  of  the body - chiefly the head, ears and base of the tail. Other rodents in these  areas  play  a  secondary  role  in  maintaining  the  infection.  In North Africa, Saudi Arabia, and Israel, the fat desert gerbil (Psammomys obesus) and other rodents ( Meriones spp.) are important reservoir hosts. Inhabitants of villages near gerbil burrows may have infection prevalence rates of 100% and others who enter the ecosystem, for example travelers, hunters, and military personnel, may also experience high attack  rates.  The  peak  incidence  of  infection  occurs  from  June  to October, with lesions appearing in October to March. Most children in endemic areas acquire a sore between 2 and 3 years of age, rarely reaching  maturity  without  a  scar.  Cutaneous  leishmaniasis  caused  by L. major is also found sporadically in a wide area of sub-Saharan Africa where  the  Nile  rat (Arvicanthis  niloticus) is  a  major  reservoir  host, although infection has been demonstrated in other rodents.

CHUNK 74
============================================================
LEISHMANIA TROPICA
Leishmania tropica is a very heterogeneous species complex with strains that  can  be  distinguished  on  ecologic,  biochemical  and  serologic
grounds. Zoonotic L. tropica is a parasite of dogs and rodents and is associated with rural disease. Anthroponotic L. tropica is a parasite of humans and occurs in urban environments. The infection was formerly  common in  many large cities  of  the  Middle East  (Baghdad, Teheran, Aleppo, and Damascus) leading to it being known as 'urban' cutaneous leishmaniasis. It  is  also  found  in  southern  Italy,  Greece, Pakistan, and north-western India. With residual insecticide spraying for malaria control, there was a marked decrease in the sandfly populations and concomitant decline in the incidence of urban cutaneous leishmaniasis. However, a major epidemic of anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis  caused by L.  tropica has  occurred  in  war-ravaged Kabul, Afghanistan, with thousands of cases identified [67].

CHUNK 75
============================================================
LEISHMANIA AETHIOPICA
Leishmania aethiopica is a zoonotic parasite found in stable, low endemicity  foci  in  mountain  valleys  of  the  Rift  Valley  of  Ethiopia  and Kenya. The mammalian reservoir is the rock hyrax (Procavia habessinica) and  the tree hyrax (Heterohyrax brucei) ,  with  the high-altitude sandfly vectors Phlebotomus longipes (Ethiopia) and Phlebotomus pedifer (Kenya). Human cases are closely associated with proximity to hyrax colonies and often occur when homesteads encroach on the zoonotic cycle on deforested mountain slopes [68].

CHUNK 76
============================================================
LEISHMANIA INFANTUM
Leishmania infantum , the usual cause of Mediterranean visceral leishmaniasis,  has  been  isolated  from  indurated,  nodular  cutaneous lesions, as well as in countries throughout the Mediterranan littoral, Iran, the Caucasus, and foci in the New World [69]. Isoenzyme analysis shows that 'dermotropic' L. infantum strains are more commonly found in cutaneous lesions and have also been isolated from visceral sites in AIDS patients.

============================================================
CHUNK 77
============================================================
PATHOGENESIS
The development of clinical disease following infection depends on the  parasite  strain  and  inoculum,  the  genetically  determined  host innate and acquired immune responses, prior exposures and sandfly factors to include components of the saliva [66]. The host inflammatory responses mediate disease expression resulting in asymptomatic infection  to  predominantly  self-healing  ulcerative  cutaneous  leishmaniasis  or  chronic,  nonhealing  diffuse  cutaneous  leishmaniasis, mucosal leishmaniasis or leishmaniasis recidivans. In general, disease resolution is mediated by cell-mediated immune responses (CMI). In self-healing cutaneous leishmaniasis, delayed-type hypersensitivity is usually present and tends to correlate to ulcer size and number, as determined by skin test  reactivity  [70].  In  leishmaniasis  recidivans, there is healing in the center of the lesion but failure to heal peripherally,  where  a  granulomatous  reaction  without  caseation  is  seen. Parasites are scanty and  the histologic changes are similar to those of lupus vulgaris. In diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis, there is a defect in the CMI response and numerous macrophages filled with amastigotes  are  seen  with  no  cellular  reaction  or  only  a  few  surrounding lymphocytes.

============================================================
CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
The  incubation  period  of  cutaneous  leishmaniasis  is  generally  2-8 weeks but, in exceptional cases, the incubation period may be as long as 3 years. The first sign of cutaneous leishmaniasis is often an unnoticed  area  of  erythema  at  the  site  of  the  sandfly  bite  that  slowly becomes an inflammatory papule. It may persist as a flattened plaque or may progress to a nodule after a few days or weeks, with the surface becoming covered with fine, papery scales (Fig. 99.9), which are white and dry at first, but later become moist and adherent, uncovering a shallow ulcer as they fall off.  As  the ulcer enlarges,  it  oozes serous fluid and may become covered with a thick crust. A raised, indurated area with a characteristic dusky discoloration surrounds the edge of the  ulcer.  Satellite  lesions  are  common  and  may  ultimately  merge with the parent lesion. Over many weeks to months the typical features of ulcerative cutaneous leishmaniasis emerge [71].
FIGURE 99.9 Cutaneous leishmania caused by Leishmania major .
FIGURE 99.10 Leishmania tropica .
Different forms of cutaneous leishmaniasis vary in some of their clinical features. The lesions of rural disease caused by L. major tend to be larger,  multiple  and can be accompanied by marked inflammation and crusting. They mature rapidly and heal relatively quickly, lasting a few months. The lesions of urban disease caused by L. tropica tend to be smaller, single, develop more slowly and persist for a year or more (Fig. 99.10).
Cutaneous leishmaniasis lesions caused by L. aethiopica are the least inflamed and most chronic; however, most lesions usually eventually heal spontaneously within 2-5 years. Leishmania aethiopica gives rise principally to localized cutaneous nodular lesions; less frequently, it gives  rise  to  oronasal  leishmaniasis,  which  may  distort  the  nostrils and lips, and a small percentage of infected individuals develop nonhealing diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis. Most lesions evolve slowly and may spread locally. Ulceration is late or absent.

============================================================
CHUNK 79
============================================================
CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
The clinical appearance of the lesions reflects the degree of the host's immune response and may vary from small papules to non-ulcerated plaques to large ulcers with well-defined, raised, indurated margins. When multiple lesions are present, they are usually similar in appearance and enlarge and heal together. After a few months to more than a  year,  healing  begins  with  central  granulation  tissue  that  spreads peripherally. The resultant depressed white or pink scar is often cosmetically disfiguring, especially when on the face. Leishmania major infections  may be  associated  with severe  scarring,  which  can  cause disability if  located at critical  sites, for  example  the wrist  or elbow, and substantial stigma for affected individuals.
FIGURE 99.11 Leishmaniasis recidivans.
Lesions usually occur on exposed parts of the body, for example face, hands, feet, arms, and legs, but rarely on the trunk and never on the palms  or  soles  or  hairy  scalp.  Uncommon  sites  of  ulcers  include the  ears,  tongue,  and  eyelids.  Fever  has  occasionally  preceded  the appearance of multiple nodules. Lymphatic spread may occur in L. major infections, with subcutaneous nodules in a linear distribution and regional lymphadenopathy. When the primary lesion is on the hand, this may resemble sporotrichosis. Secondary bacterial infection, defined  as  purulence  or  abscess,  of  an  ulcer  is  unusual;  however, bacterial colonization of ulcer surfaces is common.

CHUNK 80
============================================================
LEISHMANIASIS RECIDIVANS
Leishmaniasis recidivans is a rare  chronic form  of cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. tropica, which is found primarily in Iran, Iraq, and North Africa. This clinical manifestation  usually begins on the face (95%), slowly progresses, healing in the center and advancing at the periphery, and is characterized by the development of recrudescing lupoid papules or nodules that form mostly around, or in, the site of primary healed lesions (Fig. 99.1 1). Leishmaniasis recidivans lesions spread slowly, may persist for 20-40 years and rarely respond to  treatment,  thus  becoming  destructive  and  disfiguring  over  the years. Patients often relate a history of seasonal variation in the activity  of  the  lesions.  They  usually  became  worse  in  the  summer  and improve in the winter. Patients express little discomfort about their lesions [72].
Also known as lupoid leishmaniasis, the scarcity of amastigotes in the lesions in direct smears and tissue specimens easily leads to misdiagnosis of lupus vulgaris (cutaneous tuberculosis), both clinically and histologically. The dense scar tissue in the center of the lesion contains small granulomas, whereas the nodules and papules at the periphery resemble the 'apple jelly' nodules of lupus vulgaris.

============================================================
CHUNK 81
============================================================
DIFFUSE CUTANEOUS LEISHMANIASIS
Diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis is an uncommon result of infection with L. aethiopica in Ethiopia and Kenya. Diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis usually begins as a single, nodular, non-ulcerating lesion (often on  the  face),  which  enlarges  and  is  followed  by  multiple,  widely disseminated cutaneous macules, papules, nodules or plaques, or by diffuse infiltration of the skin (especially on extensor surfaces of the limbs and on the face) resulting in lesions scattered over the entire body (especially on the face and nose, limbs and buttocks), where thickening of the eyebrows and earlobes may resemble lepromatous leprosy [73] (Fig. 99.12). The lesions do not ulcerate and may coalesce to form plaques. Mucosal involvement is confined to the borders of the nostrils and lips. This disease does not heal spontaneously and relapses are frequent after treatment. The nodules of diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis  are  often  described  as  soft  and  fleshy,  whereas  the

nodules of lepromatous leprosy are often more indurated. Although parasites are rarely recovered from blood and bone marrow, visceral disease does not develop. The leishmanin skin test (LST) is persistently negative unless, and until, recovery occurs.

DEMONSTRATION OF THE ORGANISM
Typical ulcerative lesions should be thoroughly cleaned and exudative crusts debrided to a clean ulcer base. Using a No. 10 scalpel blade, one can scrape the clean surface to obtain material about the size of a rice grain: place on glass slides for staining and microscopic diagnosis;  place  in  culture  media;  and  place  in  95%  ethanol  for  DNA or  RNA  extraction  for  PCR  testing.  Tissue  juice  aspirated  from  the margin  of  lesions  can  also  be  cultured.  Cultures  generally  become positive within 2-7 days in Schneider's medium, but may take longer (up  to  2 1  days)  to  grow  in  Novy  and  MacNeal's  medium  (NNN) medium.
In nodular lesions amastigotes can sometimes be identified in slit skin smears prepared as for diagnosing leprosy. The margin of the lesion is  squeezed  between  the  thumb  and  forefinger  until  bloodless;  a scalpel  blade is used to make a  small incision; the cut edge of the incision is scraped with the blade; and the tissue juice on the blade is spread on a clean glass slide and stained with Giemsa stain. Alternatively, a small biopsy specimen may be removed from the edge of the lesion and an impression smear made by pressing the cut surface lightly against a slide. A portion of the biopsy specimen is macerated and cultured in NNN or Schneider's medium and the remainder fixed for  pathologic  examination. Varying  numbers  of  organisms  can be identified in histologic sections according to the immune status of the individual.
Leishmania amastigotes have a kinetoplast and must be differentiated from yeast cells and the intracellular forms of Histoplasma capsulatum and Toxoplasma gondii that do not have kinetoplasts. In leishmaniasis recidivans, organisms are rarely seen in biopsy specimens or on smear but can more often be isolated by culture or PCR. The LST is strongly positive in typical ulcerative CL.

The  LST  becomes  positive  within  3  months  of  the  onset  of  skin lesions  and  remains  positive  for  life.  Skin  test-positive  individuals may have skin lesions for which the etiology is not leishmaniasis.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
On clinical grounds, the lesions of cutaneous leishmaniasis must be distinguished from diphtheritic or veldt sores, tropical ulcer, tertiary syphilis,  yaws,  lupus  vulgaris,  blastomycosis,  basal  cell  carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and other causes of chronic nodules and ulcers.  Although  the  LST  is  sometimes  helpful,  definitive  diagnosis depends on demonstration or isolation of the organism.

TYPICAL OLD WORLD CUTANEOUS LEISHMANIASIS
The majority of Old World cutaneous leishmaniasis lesions, especially rural zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L.  major ,  are  selfhealing, requiring a few months to heal completely. Urban anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. tropica can take many months or a few years to heal. In general, systemic treatment is less commonly  employed  in  Old  World  disease  compared  with  New World disease. There is a paucity of evidence-based data from highquality clinical trials in Old World cutaneous leishmaniasis [74].

============================================================
LOCAL THERAPY
Local  treatments  include  thermotherapy,  cryotherapy,  topical  paromomycin ointments, intralesional administration of SbV and combinations of all of the above.
Local  heat  therapy  is  useful  in  treating  small  lesions.  One  or  two applications of localized heat (50°C for 30 s) with the ThermoMed® device was as effective as intralesional SbV (70% cure rate) in L. tropica acquired in Afghanistan [75] and more effective (70% cure rate) than systemic SbV + in L. major acquired in Iraq [76]. The device is expensive  but  works  on  a  battery  -  a  significant  advantage  for  field  use. Local  anesthesia  must  be  applied  to  the  lesion  prior  to  using  the device. A blister is seen 1-2 days after thermotherapy, but appears to be  well-tolerated.  Application  of  a  topical  antibiotic  ointment  and wound care decreases the incidence of secondary wound infections.
Cryotherapy is achieved with application of liquid nitrogen every 3-7 days  for  1-5  sessions.  Each  weekly  administration  is  usually  two application cycles of 10-15 seconds of freezing time, with a thawing interval of 20 seconds. Freezing should reach up to a few millimeters of healthy skin surrounding the lesion. Liquid nitrogen application requires  specific  devices  and  a  skilled  healthcare  provider.  Postcryotherapy care includes daily cleansing with an antiseptic solution and topical application of antibiotic ointment.

============================================================
LOCAL THERAPY
Topical paromomycin creams at various doses, regimens and formulations  have  been  used  for  decades.  A  topical  formulation  of  15% paromomycin with 12% methylbenzethonium chloride in soft white paraffin (Leshcutan®, Teva, Israel) gives variable responses in L. major ranging from 30-75%, and little-to-no efficacy in L. tropica . Because this preparation causes significant local reactions consisting of pruritus,  paresthesias  and  vesicle  formation  in  about  25%  of  patients, other,  better-tolerated  preparations  have  been  developed.  A  10% paromomycin/10% urea formulation used twice daily for 14 days was no  better  than  placebo  in  controlled  trials  in  Iran  and  Tunisia.  A longer regimen (up to 12 weeks) of 12-15% paromomycin/10% urea applied daily cured 23 out of 27 patients at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases  in  London  in  a  mean  of  6.7  weeks  and  was  reported  as nontoxic. None of the topical agents are effective against cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. tropica . A third-generation formulation of 15% paromomycin and 0.5% gentamicin was shown to be superior to  placebo  in L.  major acquired  in  Tunisia  and  was  safe  and  welltolerated [77]. Although the next generation of paromomycin-based topicals appears quite promising, the best formulation and optimal dose regimen are not yet determined. It is likely that the optimal dose regimens will have to be determined for each major geographic area.
Intralesional SbV, defined as local infiltration of 0.3-0.8 mL of SbV, has  been  used  extensively  for  Old  World  cutaneous  leishmaniasis with some success and merits consideration, especially for early, nonulcerated  lesions.  Each  lesion  is  injected  individually,  dividing  the dose into four quadrants if possible. The reported number of injections and the daily dose used vary widely, but efficacy is similar to intramuscular administration. Intralesional SbV can be very painful depending on the location injected but avoids systemic toxicity and reduces costs.
Combinations of intralesional SbV co-administered with cryotherapy have been shown to be superior to either one alone [78].

CHUNK 89
============================================================
SYSTEMIC CHEMOTHERAPY
Systemic treatment is indicated for large, or multiple, lesions and to patients with lesions in functionally or cosmetically important areas, for example the wrist, feet, and ankles, or face when local treatments are not indicated. SbV can be given intramuscularly or intravenously at 20 mg Sb/kg/day for 10-20 days. Cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. tropica and L. aethiopica usually requires a longer treatment duration, while cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. major may be adequately  treated  with  the  shorter  10-day  regimen.  The  true  efficacy of  SbV  in  Old  World  cutaneous  leishmaniasis  in  most  locations has never been established and is thought by many to be minimally effective [57].
Oral fluconazole at 200 mg daily for 6 weeks was shown to shorten the time to healing in L. major infections in Saudi Arabia compared with  placebo  [79].  A  more  recent  randomized  controlled  trial  in patients with L. major in Iran showed that a higher fluconazole dose of 400 mg was superior to the 200 mg dose in shortening the time to  healing  [80].  The  optimal  dose  of  fluconazole  remains  to  be determined.

LEISHMANIASIS RECIDIVANS
The World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended treatment for leishmaniasis recidivans is 15-20 mg SbV + /kg  per day intramuscularly or intravenously for 15 days plus oral allopurinol 20 mg/kg for 30 days, to treat leishmaniasis recidivans caused by L. tropica [57] .

============================================================
DIFFUSE CUTANEOUS LEISHMANIASIS
Diffuse  cutaneous  leishmaniasis  in  Ethiopia  and  Kenya  responds poorly  to  treatment  with  SbV.  The  WHO  currently  recommends 20 mg SbV + /kg per day intramuscularly or intravenously plus paromomycin, 15 mg (11-mg base)/kg per day intramuscularly for 60 days or longer to treat diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis [57]. Whatever the regimen  used,  treatment  should  be  prolonged  for  several  weeks beyond clinical cure.

============================================================
VECTOR CONTROL
Reducing the vector population can decrease the incidence of cutaneous leishmaniasis. Improved general sanitation and removal of refuse and rubble in which sandflies breed reduces the incidence of urban cutaneous  leishmaniasis.  Residual  spraying  with  dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) for malaria control had eliminated cutaneous leishmaniasis in many areas, although it has returned with the cessation of spraying.

IMMUNIZATION
Intracutaneous vaccination with live, attenuated L. major promastigotes was used for many years in Russia, Israel, Iran, Iraq and Jordan. ('leishmanization'), and a lesion is allowed to develop and run its natural course. This results in a single scar in a cosmetically-acceptable location, and the immunity that develops is comparable to that following  a  natural  infection.  There  is  a  small  risk  of  developing  a cutaneous leishmaniasis lesion requiring treatment or the development of leishmaniasis recidivans at the site of immunization.

DEFINITION
Cutaneous leishmaniasis of the New World is a zoonosis caused by parasites of the species complexes Leishmania mexicana and Leishmania braziliensis (Fig. 99.4 and Table 99-1). Mucosal leishmaniasis, also known as  'espundia', is  characterized  by  destructive  oral,  nasal  or pharyngeal lesions and is usually associated with L. braziliensis infection. Local names for New World cutaneous leishmaniasis include uta (Peru), chiclero ulcer or bay sore (Mexico), dicera de Baurid (Brazil), and pian bois or forest yaws (Guyana). Collectively, these diseases are also referred to as American cutaneous leishmaniasis.

============================================================
CHUNK 96
============================================================
ETIOLOGY
New World cutaneous leishmaniasis parasites are  divided into two complexes,  the L.  (Leishmania) complex  and L.  (Viannia) complex that  are  known  to  infect  humans  (Fig.  99.4).  Members  of  the L. (Leishmania) complex  develop  in  the  midgut  and  foregut  of  their sandfly vectors, whereas members of the L. (Viannia) complex develop in the hindgut, as well as the midgut and foregut. L. infantum has also been isolated from lesions of CL on rare occasions.

============================================================
DISTRIBUTION AND EPIDEMIOLOGY
The geographic distribution of New World cutaneous leishmaniasis is  shown  in  Fig.  99.13.  New  World  cutaneous  leishmaniasis  is  an uncommon disease  in  returning  travelers  from  endemic  areas  but should be considered when evaluating an ulcerative lesion in persons with an exposure or travel history. Those conducting field studies are at highest risk, but casual tourists with brief exposures also become infected.  Sylvatic  or  wild  transmission  cycles  are  adapting  to  peridomestic  environments  with domestic  animal reservoirs associated with  increasing  urbanization.  In  addition,  people  moving  into endemic areas  for  natural  products extraction  (oil  and gas,  timber, road  building,  etc.),  armed  conflicts  and  increasingly  adventurous travel and ecotourism lead to new infections and epidemics of cutaneous leishmaniasis in non-immune people [81].

CHUNK 98
============================================================
LEISHMANIA MEXICANA
The parasite causing chiclero ulcer is common throughout southern Mexico, Belize, and Guatemala, and causes the rare cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis acquired in the southern USA. It is transmitted among forest rodents by Lutzomyia olmeca ,  which is not highly attracted to humans. However, the prolonged exposure of 'chicleros', who live for  many  months  in  the  forest  collecting  chewing  gum  latex  from chicle trees, explains the high incidence of infection in these workers, i.e.  30%  during  the  first  year  of  employment.  Timber  cutters,  road builders  and  agricultural  workers  are  also  commonly  infected.  In south Texas, the southern plains wood rat, Neotoma micropus ,  is the reservoir and Lutzomyia anthophora the primary vector of the enzootic cycle [82].

CHUNK 99
============================================================
LEISHMANIA AMAZONENSIS
This parasite occurs in the Amazon region of Brazil and neighboring countries. It is primarily a disease of forest rodents, but marsupials and foxes  can  be secondary  hosts.  Infection  rates  of  20%  occur  in some  rodent  species  in  Brazil,  but  human  disease  is  uncommon because  the  vector Lutzomyia  flaviscutellata is  nocturnal,  is  not  very anthropophilic and lives in swampy areas of the forest seldom frequented by people.

LEISHMANIA (VIANNIA) BRAZILIENSIS
Leishmania  braziliensis ,  which  primarily  causes  infection  of  forest rodents, causes cutaneous leishmaniasis and mucosal leishmaniasis in humans. Human infection occurs in all endemic countries of the Americas except Guyana, Surinam and the USA. Leishmania braziliensis likely causes a spectrum of illness across its geographic range and is associated with multiple sandfly vectors. Disease is common among persons living in farming communities in newly cleared forest areas, and in road construction and mining workers [83].

LEISHMANIA (VIANNIA) PANAMENSIS
This parasite is found from Guatemala in the north through Central America and Colombia and Ecuador in the south. The principal reservoir is the tree sloth, Choloepus hoffmanni .  Other sloths,  procyonids, and forest primates are secondary hosts. The major vector, Lutzomyia trapidoi , usually lives in the forest canopy in close contact with the known reservoirs. However, at certain times of the year, when rainfall is moderate,  it  can be found close to the ground where it can bite humans. Human disease is common in rural agricultural workers, especially in the first year after settlement before deforestation is complete, and in military personnel participating in jungle warfare training.

Parasites have been cultured from lesions of cutaneous leishmaniasis in various parts of South America that have isoenzyme patterns and growth characteristics in culture and laboratory animals that are different from those of known species of Leishmania . Leishmania infantum causes non-ulcerative nodular cutaneous leishmaniasis in Honduras and Costa Rica.

DIFFUSE CUTANEOUS LEISHMANIASIS
A diffuse form of cutaneous leishmaniasis is rarely seen in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru, Venezuela, or the USA. Diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis in the New World is usually associated with L. mexicana and L. amazonensis infections.

============================================================
CHUNK 107
============================================================
CUTANEOUS DISEASE
The  lesions  of  New  World  cutaneous  leishmaniasis  are  generally similar to those of Old World disease. A few weeks to several months after infection, an erythematous, often pruritic, papule develops at the site of inoculation. The initial papule may become scaly or gradually enlarge, developing a raised indurated margin with central ulceration. Verrucous and acneiform lesions are uncommon, but nodular lesions are seen in about 10%. Ulcerative lesions are usually painless unless secondarily  infected.  The  natural  history  varies  depending  on  the infecting species, location of the lesion and host immunity. Leishmania mexicana infections generally have one or a few lesions that heal spontaneously within six months. In Guatemala, 22 out of 25 lesions caused by L. mexicana (88%) completely re-epithelialized by a median lesion age of 14 weeks (range: 6-44 weeks) and 17 (68%) were classified as cured six months later [84]. However, lesions on the ear occur in 40% of patients and are chronic, lasting many years. Simple cutaneous lesions caused by parasites of the L. braziliensis complex generally require 6-18 months for spontaneous healing but sometimes persist much longer. In addition, enlargement of the lymph nodes draining the  bite  site  commonly  accompanies,  or  precedes,  the  ulcer  in
L.  braziliensis infections  [85,  86].  Multiple  skin  lesions  owing  to metastatic spread along lymphatics are common with L.  guyanensis infections, and subcutaneous lymphatic nodules resembling sporotrichosis are often seen in L. panamensis infections.
Trauma  to  uninvolved  skin  can  lead  to  the  formation  of  lesions caused by Leishmania (Koebner phenomenon) [87]. Persons living in endemic areas note the ulcers of cutaneous leishmania develop along machete cuts or  other  such blunt  and  sharp  trauma.  Postoperative granulomas caused by Leishmania have also been reported as postsurgical complications.

============================================================
CHUNK 108
============================================================
MUCOSAL DISEASE
One to five  percent  of  persons  infected  with L.  braziliensis develop mucosal  leishmaniasis.  Mucosal  leishmaniasis  is  more  commonly seen in Bolivia, Brazil and Peru, and is much less common in northern South America and Central America [88]. The lesions of ML may appear concurrently with the primary cutaneous ulcer but more often several months to many years after healing of the initial cutaneous lesion. The nasal mucosa is the first site involved. Initially, patients may complain of nasal stuffiness, difficulty in breathing through their nose and occasional bleeding as their first symptoms associated with erythema and edema of the involved nasal mucosa. This proceeds to septum  ulceration  covered  with  a  mucopurulent  exudate.  There  is often mutilating destruction of the nasal septum (Fig. 99.14), palate, lips, pharynx and larynx in severe mucosal leishmaniasis. The lesions are chronic and progressive and death can be caused by aspiration or inanition.  Mucosal  leishmaniasis  can  also  less  commonly  be  seen with L.  panamensis and L.  guyanensis infections.  Hoarseness  should prompt  evaluation  of  the  vocal  cords  for  laryngeal  involvement. Mucosal leishmaniasis does not spontaneously resolve, is more difficult  to  treat  especially  in  patients  with  severe  or  extensive  disease and secondary bacterial infections are common.
There  is  currently  no  way  to  predict  the  development  of  mucosal leishmaniasis  in  a  person  with  primary  cutaneous  leishmaniasis. However, risk factors for the development of mucosal leishmaniasis are male gender, older age, severe malnutrition and lesion duration of over four months [89]. In addition, a genetic component for the risk of developing mucosal leishmaniasis has long been suspected to include association between human leukocyte antigen (HLA) loci and
FIGURE 99.14 Mucosal leishmaniasis.
the  presence  of  mucosal  leishmaniasis  and  polymorphisms  in  the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα ) and beta (TNFβ ) genes associated with high circulating levels of TNFα .

============================================================
CHUNK 109
============================================================
DIFFUSE CUTANEOUS LEISHMANIASIS
The initial lesion is  usually  a  macule, papule, or  nodule (rarely  an ulcer).  Because  of  an  immunologic defect  in  the  host,  the  parasite spreads  locally  and  hematogenously  to  cause  generalized  nodular lesions  consisting  of  heavily  parasitized  macrophages.  The  nasal mucosa  and  laryngopharynx  are  sometimes  involved,  but  visceral lesions do not occur.

============================================================
CHUNK 110
============================================================
DEMONSTRATION OF THE ORGANISM
As in other forms of leishmaniasis, definitive diagnosis requires demonstration  of  the  parasite.  The  methods  are  the  same  as  those  for diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis of the Old World (see Chapter 99.3). Studies in Guatemala and Colombia show that yields of parasites are similar whether the material is collected from the edge of the lesion  or  from  the  ulcer  base  provided  appropriate debridement  is performed. It is important to completely debride the crusted exudative material from the ulcer before trying to scrape or aspirate. Wetto-dry gauze pads are often required for adequate debridement. This can be quite painful for the patient and local anesthesia with injectable 1% lidocaine with epinephrine is recommended, if available. Use of  topical  anesthetics  such  as  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  have  also proven  useful.  The  sensitivity  of  culture  can  also  be  improved  by 20-25% if 3-5 cultures per ulcerative lesion are obtained [90, 91]. In practice, if the only goal is to demonstrate parasites prior to instituting therapy, then several smears can be made and examined before resorting to culture. Organisms are generally more numerous in smears and biopsy specimens of cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. mexicana but are often scanty in L. braziliensis infection of both the skin and mucous membranes, especially in long-standing disease. Cultures of tissue juice aspirated from the indurated margin of a skin lesion or of  biopsy  specimens  of  skin  or  mucosal  lesions  are  more  likely  to confirm L. braziliensis infection.
Although assay performance is laboratory-dependent and the general availability is poor, the use of PCR to amplify Leishmania DNA targets is now very common in endemic areas.

============================================================
CHUNK 111
============================================================
SKIN TEST
The leishmanin skin test (LST) is positive in almost all patients with active cutaneous leishmaniasis and mucosal leishmaniasis, although it may be negative during the first few months. Treatment is occasionally justified despite the failure to demonstrate parasites in persons with typical lesions and a positive skin test, especially in those with espundia.  In  diffuse  cutaneous  leishmaniasis,  the  skin  test  is  uniformly negative.

============================================================
CHUNK 112
============================================================
SEROLOGIC TESTS
Standard serologic tests are not useful for diagnosis of New World cutaneous leishmaniasis or mucosal leishmaniasis. Assays using crude antigen preparations are positive at low titer in only 70-80% of cases and  are  especially  likely  to  be  negative  early  in  the  course  of  the disease, when a diagnosis is most desired.

============================================================
CHUNK 113
============================================================
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
New World cutaneous leishmaniasis must be distinguished from sporotrichosis,  blastomycosis,  yaws,  syphilis,  cutaneous  tuberculosis, Mycobacterium marinum infection, and dermatologic cancers. Diseases that may resemble espundia include paracoccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, tuberculosis, syphilis, malignant tumors and lethal midline granuloma. Nodular diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis must be differentiated from lepromatous leprosy.

CHUNK 114
============================================================
TYPICAL NEW WORLD CUTANEOUS LEISHMANIASIS
Systemic chemotherapy is generally indicated in New World cutaneous leishmaniasis in contrast to Old World cutaneous leishmaniasis. New World cutaneous leishmaniasis tends to be more severe and to last longer than cutaneous leishmaniasis of the Old World. Indications  for  systemic  treatment  include  the  multiplicity  of  lesions, the chronicity of untreated disease or progression of mucosal disease in  the  absence  of  chemotherapy.  The  therapeutic  decision  is  a risk:benefit ratio of the intervention for each patient; no single treatment approach fits all  clinical  presentations.  Experience  with  local therapy for New World cutaneous leishmaniasis is limited as  local therapy  was  long  considered  unsuitable  for  the  treatment  of  New World cutaneous leishmaniasis, especially in those patients infected with L.  braziliensis or L.  panamensis because  of  the  potential risk  of mucosal leishmaniasis and the belief that systemic treatment could prevent  metastasis  and  mucosal  leishmaniasis.  However,  systemic treatment does not guarantee prevention of later mucosal leishmaniasis and it is now considered acceptable to use local therapy in selected cases of New World cutaneous leishmaniasis.

============================================================
Pentavalent antimonials
A randomized controlled trial in patients with L.  panamensis infections showed that treatment with sodium stibogluconate (SSG) at a dosage of 20 mg of Sb/kg/day for 20 days gave a significantly higher cure rate than did a dosage of 10 mg of Sb/kg/day for 20 days [92]. This dosage and duration are also recommended for other forms of simple New World cutaneous leishmaniasis. Lower doses and shorter regimens may be effective in certain geographic regions. Toxicity of SSG is discussed in Chapter 99.2. If toxicity does occur at the higher doses, the drug should be withheld for a few days until side effects resolve and treatment can then usually be resumed at the same dose.

CHUNK 116
============================================================
Amphotericin B
In  patients  unresponsive  to  SbV,  amphotericin  B  deoxycholate  is usually effective. One mg/kg doses are administered by slow intravenous infusion on alternate days. Prolonged treatment to a total of 2-3 g is generally required. LAMB is increasingly being used as the drug  of  choice  to  treat  cutaneous  leishmaniasis  in  higher  income countries with generally good results, although there are case reports of failure [93].

============================================================
Pentamidine
Pentamidine was as effective as  pentavalent  antimonials  for  curing cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. panamensis or L. guyanensis in Brazil,  Colombia,  French  Guiana  and  Suriname.  Recent  trials  in Colombia have shown that 2 mg/kg given intramuscularly (IM) every other day for seven doses or 3 mg/kg given IM every other day for four  doses  cured  72  out  of  75  (96%)  evaluable  patients  [94].  The injections  were  well  tolerated  and  no  significant  side  effects  were noted. It is, however, less efficient than antimonials against disease caused by L. braziliensis

Ketoconazole
Ketoconazole  gave  a  70%  cure  rate  in  patients  with  cutaneous leishmaniasis  caused  by L.  panamensis in  Guatemala;  however,  it is  less effective for L. braziliensis , curing only seven out of 23 (30%) infections [95]. Because it can be given orally, ketoconazole may thus have  a  role  in  some  patients  for  whom  parenteral  therapy  is  not possible.

Miltefosine
Current World Health  Organization  (WHO)  recommendations include miltefosine at 2.5 mg/kg day orally for 28 days for cutaneous
leishmaniasis caused by L. mexicana , L. guyanensis and L. panamemsis [57]. Miltefosine is also  75% effective against CL caused by L.  braziliensis acquired in Bahia Brazil [96], 70% effective in Colombia, 70% in  Bolivia  [97],  but  only  53%  effective  in  Guatemala  [98].  The response of L. braziliensis to miltefosine may vary depending on the geographic area.

Local agents
Intralesional injections of SbV, accepted therapy for disease in the Old World, have not seen wide use in the Americas. There are no large comparative trials on which to base recommendations.
Topical application of paromomycin formulations has been evaluated in  Ecuador  and  Colombia.  In  Ecuador,  an  open,  non-randomized trial of 15% paromomycin with 12% methylbenzethonium chloride in  white  paraffin  cured  90%  of  52  patients  [99].  In  Colombia, another  open,  non-randomized  trial  of  15%  paromomycin  with 5% methylbenzethonium  chloride  combined  with  parenteral  Glucantime  at  20 mg/kg  daily  for  7  days  cured  18  out  of  20  (90%) patients [100]. The true efficacy remains to be determined in controlled trials, but topical paromomycin formulations may have a role in combination with SbV to decrease the number of injections required for cure.

MUCOSAL LEISHMANIASIS
Current WHO recommendations for the treatment of mucosal leishmaniasis include SbV at 20 mg/kg per day intramuscularly or intravenously for 30 days, SbV plus oral pentoxifylline at 400 mg/8 h for 30 days [101], amphotericin B deoxycholate at 0.7-1 mg/kg by infusion every other day up to 25-45 doses, or liposomal amphotericin B: 2-3 mg/kg daily by infusion up to a total dose of 40-60 mg/kg. Miltefosine  at  2.5-3.3 mg/kg  per  day  orally  for  28  days  has  been shown to be efficacious in an open label study in Bolivia [102]. The cure  rate  for  the  36  patients  who  had 'mild' disease  (i.e. affecting nasal  skin  and  nasal  mucosa)  was  83%.  The  cure  rate  for  the  36 patients  who  had  more  extensive  disease  (involving  the  palate, pharynx  and  larynx)  was  58%.  Reportedly,  patients  refused  to  be randomized  to  parenteral  agents  because  they  preferred  the  oral agent.  The  cure  rate  for  an  almost  contemporary  group  receiving amphotericin B (45 mg/kg over 90 days) was 50%.
In patients with advanced mucosal leishmaniasis, adequate nutrition must be ensured and destructive or obstructive lesions may require ventilatory support or treatment, as in aspiration pneumonia. Plastic surgery may be required after parasitologic cure in patients with extensive tissue destruction from espundia.

DIFFUSE CUTANEOUS LEISHMANIASIS
In contrast to Ethiopian diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis, Venezuelan diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis often improves after initial treatment with  SbV,  although  relapse  is  invariable  and  patients  who  relapse often do not respond to additional SbV treatment.
Miltefosine produces a dramatic clinical and parasitologic response in  patients  with  diffuse  cutaneous  leishmaniasis  and  improvement continued  during  drug  administration,  but  patients  relapse  and develop new lesions when treatment is stopped [103]. Continuous use or intermittent treatments may be useful.

============================================================
PROGNOSIS
Cutaneous lesions usually  heal  (complete  epithelialization)  within 1-2  months  after  initiation  of  treatment  with  SbV,  although  large ulcers may require longer. In a study of ulcerative cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. braziliensis , 32% of lesions had re-epithelialized at the end of a 3-week treatment course, 60% at 6 weeks, and 90% at 13 weeks. Mucosal disease caused by L. braziliensis , which may appear many years after the primary cutaneous lesion has resolved, is progressive unless treated. The risk of espundia may be reduced in persons whose  primary  cutaneous  lesions  are  adequately  treated.  Diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis is characteristically a relapsing or chronically progressive disease.

PREVENTION AND CONTROL
Vaccines and chemoprophylactic drugs are not available. Because of the  forest  location  of  vectors  and  reservoirs,  control  of  American cutaneous leishmaniasis and mucosal leishmaniasis is not possible. The only exception is uta, which, because of its domiciliary nature, can  be  mimimized  by  spraying  houses  with  insecticides.  Insect repellents, long-sleeved shirts and fine-mesh bed-netting may reduce  the  risk  of  infection  for  individual  travelers.  Permethrinimpregnated clothing is also effective. In a study of Colombian military personnel in an endemic area for 6.6 weeks and followed for an additional 12 weeks, 4 out of 143 (3%) soldiers wearing permethrinimpregnated  uniforms  acquired  disease,  whereas  18  out  of  143 (18%) soldiers  who  did  not  wear  impregnated  uniforms  acquired disease [104].
