Key features
- Human gnathostomiasis, is also called Tau-cheed (Thailand), Yangtze River edema and Shanghai's rheumatism (China), Rangoon tumor (Myanmar), Woodbury bug (Australia), Choko,shi (Japan), and nodular migratory eosinophilic panniculitis or traveling cutaneous in-ammation (Ecuador)
- Gnathostoma species cause subcutaneous migratory swellings, piercing sensations and, less commonly, ocular and central nervous system disease
- Gnathostomiasis is a food-borne parasitic zoonosis. Consumption of intermediate/paratenic hosts, usually raw ,sh, shrimp, crab, frog, or chicken, is the source of infection
- Treatment is surgical when the worm can be accessed or medical with albendazole and/or ivermectin

INTRODUCTION
Parasites  of  the  genus Gnathostoma are  nematode  infections  of  cats and  other  carnivores.  Five  species  that  affect  humans  are  reported: Gnathostoma spinigerum (the  most  common; Richard Owen, 1836); Gnathostoma  hispidum (Fedtschenko,  1872); Gnathostoma doloresi (Tubangui,  1925); Gnathostoma  nipponicum (Yamaguti,  1941);  and Gnathostoma binucleatum (Almeyda-Artigas, 1991). Gnathostomiases have similar manifestations, including subcutaneous migratory swellings.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Gnathostomiases, especially G. spinigerum ,  have  become  more common. Since 1889, patients infected with G. spinigerum have been reported in Thailand (Fig. 1 17.1) and G. binucleatum is  currently  in Mexico and other neighboring Latin American countries. Gnathostoma hispidum, G. doleresi , and G. nipponicum have been reported in Japan and China [1]. A few gnathostomiasis cases have been reported from non-endemic  countries,  for  example G. spinigerum infection  in Zambia, South Africa and Brazil, and G. hispidum infection in Spain. It  is  likely  that  gnathostomiasis  is  under-reported  in  many  Asian countries.
Definitive  hosts  for  gnathostomiasis  are  dogs,  cats,  pigs,  wild  pigs, weasels, and other mammals [1, 2]. Several species of amphibians, reptiles, avians, and mammals act as intermediate hosts of both G. spinigerum and G. binucleatum . In Thailand, 48 species of vertebrates (including  20  species  of  freshwater  fish)  can serve  as  second  intermediate  and/or  paratenic  hosts.  In  Mexico,  25  species  of  fish  and seven species of fish-eating birds are recorded as intermediate hosts.

Human gnathostomiases are found more frequently in adults than children,  and  in  more  females  than  males,  with  the  exception  of Vietnam where males are more frequently infected [3, 4] . Occupation, dietary  habits and social  aspects  affect  the probability  of infection. Patients as young as 3 days old have been reported, suggesting prenatal or perinatal transmission [5, 6].

============================================================
NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
Adult nematodes coil in the stomach muscles of the definitive host. Eggs are passed in feces and, when exposed to water, release larvae. These larvae are ingested by freshwater copepods that are ingested, in turn,  by  an  intermediate  host,  where  larvae  invade  and  lodge  in muscle. Humans acquire the parasite by consuming the second- or third-stage larvae from infected intermediate hosts or paratenic hosts. In humans, larvae cannot develop into adult worms and will penetrate the stomach wall and migrate randomly within the human host. These larvae measure  2.5-12.5 mm. The incubation  period, or the time between ingestion of a worm and the first appearance of cutaneous manifestations, is usually from 3 to 4 weeks, although it can be as long as several years. Untreated, the worm can live in humans for several years; therefore, a long, asymptomatic interval can be followed by a sudden recurrence of symptoms [7].
Infection results in nonspecific symptoms, such as fever, mild malaise, urticaria,  and  epigastric  pain,  followed  by  external  (cutaneous)  or internal  (visceral)  larva  migrans.  The  migrating  worm  produces several toxins (acetylcholine, hyaluronidase, proteolytic enzyme, and hemolytic substance). The pathologic picture of swelling and tracklike necrosis demonstrates an intense cellular infiltration with neutrophils,  mononuclear  cells,  plasma  cells,  and  large  numbers  of eosinophils. Allergic changes are seen with hyper-eosinophilia. The parasite can migrate to the ocular system and central nervous system (CNS) causing localized inflammation and destruction.

CLINICAL FEATURES
The most common manifestation is intermittent, migratory swelling in the skin and subcutaneous tissues. If the swelling is subcutaneous, there are usually signs of inflammation, redness, and pain. The swelling is hard and non-pitting and lasts for 1-4 weeks before it disappears.  Re-appearance  of  swelling  can  occur  after  an  asymptomatic interval of 1 week to several months in a new location not far from the previous one (Figs 1 17.2 and 1 17.3).
Patients can initially suffer from epigastric pain, nausea, or vomiting which  are  likely  caused  by  penetration  of  the  gastric  wall  by  the ingested  larvae.  Other  features  can  be  fever,  liver  tenderness,  and pleuro-pulmonary  involvement.  Frequent  coughing,  hemoptysis, chest pain, dyspnea, pneumothorax, hematuria with or without renal pain,  and  granuloma  formation  in  the  peritoneal cavity  can occur. With CNS invasion, eosinophilic meningitis or meningoencephalitis, subarachnoid,  intracerebral  or  intraventricular  hemorrhage,  radiculopathy, paralysis, seizures, altered conciousness, coma and death can

occur [1, 6]. With ocular invasion, probably by migration of the worm along  the  optic  nerves,  there  can  be  decreased  visual  acuity  and blindness.
With G. binucleatum , clinical features are similar to G. spinigerum with the additional invasion of peripheral extremities, face, head, and possibly cardiac tissue [8].

CLINICAL FEATURES
Physical examination findings depend on the area of the body into which the worms migrate and vary between Gnathostoma species. In cases of G. spinigerum and G. binucleatum infection, the disease can persist in subcutaneous tissue with relapses over several years, while in cases of G. hispidum , G. nipponicum , and G. doloresi infection, surface skin lesions spontaneously disappear within 3 months even without treatment. A peripheral blood leukocytosis with hyper-eosinophilia occurs in acute cases. The degree of eosinophilia (sometimes as high as 90%) does not correlate with clinical severity. In cerebral gnathostomiasis,  the  cerebrospinal  fluid  (CSF)  is  usually  bloody  or  xanthochromic and has a pleocytosis [9].

PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The  initial  evaluation  should  be  focused  on  characteristic  clinical findings, travel or residence in a gnathostomiasis endemic area, and dietary history suggesting ingestion of intermediate or paratenic hosts.
FIGURE  117.3 Cutaneous  infection  with Gnathostoma  spinigerum with involvement of the left index 1nger.
An  increased  eosinophil  count  in  peripheral  blood  or  CSF  can  be present;  however,  the  eosinophil  count  may  also  not  be  elevated, which may lead to a delay in diagnosis. In one clinical series, 47% had eosinophilia [7].
The differential diagnosis for cerebral, visceral and cutaneous gnathostomiases includes intracerebral tuberculosis,  syphilis,  lymphoma, eosinophilic meningitis, or meningoencephalitis, intracranial haemorrhage,  localized  angioedema,  and  helminth  infections  of  loiasis, spirurina  larvae,  and  baylisascariasis  (roundworms  of  raccoons). Computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound  can assist  in  the  detection  of  gnathostomiasis,  but serologic  tests  should accompany imaging studies.  Antibody detection using serum and/or CSF can be used to identify a specific IgG to a 24-kDa antigen from G. spinigerum larvae. This test is highly sensitive and specific [10]. Gnathostoma spinigerum cDNA recombinant antigens have  also  been  developed  for  antibody  detection  -  two  matrix metalloproteinase-like proteins. The sensitivity and specificity of these tests have yet to be established.

============================================================
TREATMENT
Definitive  therapy  is  surgical  removal  of  the  worms.  Extraction  of superficial  cutaneous Gnathostoma can  be  performed  by  needles  or scratching [1], and surgical extraction for intravitreal gnathostomiasis. Albendazole (400 mg twice a day for 21-28 days)  demonstrated  a
90-94% cure rate for cutaneous gnathostomiasis [11, 12]. In albendazole-  and/or  ivermectin-treated  patients,  gnathostomes  may  be stimulated to move to the skin surface [13, 14]. Patients on a month of albendazole can experience nausea, headache, and vomiting, and should be monitored for liver toxicity. Ivermectin at 0.2 mg/kg single dose has been shown to be effective in killing third-stage larvae of G. spinigerum , with cure rates of 76%, while repeated ivermectin used in relapsed cases demonstrates cure rates of nearly 100% [15]. In one study,  ivermectin  at  0.2 mg/kg  body  weight  for  2  consecutive  days demonstrated a cure rate of 100% with mild side effects [16]. A combination  of  supportive,  symptomatic  and  anti-inflammatory  treatments can also be used. In CNS gnathostomiasis, corticosteroids may have an additional role in reducing CNS inflammation and intensive neurologic care is important in critical cases; however, recurrence of symptoms is possible. Therefore, post-treatment, long-term follow-up of  antibody  levels  and  eosinophilia  may  be  helpful  to  observe decreases over time. Following antibody levels for at least 1 year is recommended.
