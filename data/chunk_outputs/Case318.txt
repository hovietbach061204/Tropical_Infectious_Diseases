INTRODUCTION
Blastomycosis  is  an  endemic  mycosis  caused  by  the  dimorphic fungal species Blastomyces dermatitidis and B. gilchristii. Analysis of atypical specimens has resulted in the description of a third species, B. helicus (formerly Emmonsia helicus ). 1 Further work is needed to clarify  the  role  of  this  agent . Historically,  disease  was  termed North  American  blastomycosis.  This  terminology  has  been abandoned, as there have been increasing reports of blastomycosis from other parts of the world. The term paracoccidioidomycosis has become accepted for the disease previously called South American blastomycosis,  as  this  is  caused  by Paracoccidioides  brasiliensis . 2 Infection  typically  presents  as  an  acute  or  indolent  pulmonary process or as a chronic skin lesion, although infection of almost any site can occur. Disease may often be misdiagnosed as another type of infection or malignancy. T reatment with antifungal agents is usually successful.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Most  reported  cases  of  blastomycosis  have  been  from  North America, concentrated in the Mississippi, Ohio, and St. Lawrence River basins and the Great Lakes region of the United States and Canada. 3 Occasional cases have been reported from Africa, Central America, northern South America, and the Mediterranean basin. B. gilchristii has been described in Canada and the northern United States, and B. helicus has been identi{ed in parts of Canada and the  United  States  west  of  the  traditional  endemic  area  for B.  dermatitidis . 1,4 Unlike  the  causative  agents  of  other  endemic mycoses, such as histoplasmosis or coccidioidomycosis, B. dermatitidis has not been consistently isolated from the soil, although epidemiologically, this is the source. 5  Common-source outbreaks have been reported in the literature,  and  Klein  and  coworkers

Blastomycosis
Keyur S. Vyas, Robert W. Bradsher, Jr.
provided strong evidence of B. dermatitidis in the soil by culturing the organism in association with an epidemic. 6 In this report, the epidemic  was  likely  due  to  the  presence  of  moist  soil,  highly enriched with organic material that provided favorable conditions for  the  organism to grow. Many patients with infection in this epidemic  did  not  have  signs  and  symptoms  characteristic  of blastomycosis, supporting the existence of subclinical or self-limited infection, as occurs in histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis.
Although there is no particular predisposition to developing blastomycosis,  many  patients  have  a  history  of  recreational  or occupational exposure to wooded areas and often to soil associated with animals or bodies of freshwater such as lakes and rivers. 2,5 A review  of  1114  cases  from  the  literature  revealed  that  87%  of patients were between 20 and 69 years of age. 7 The male-to-female ratio  is  at  least  4  :  1,  probably  due  to  differences  in  exposure. 2 Although infection in children is rare, it is well documented. 8 In a  recent  study  of  isolates  from  pediatric patients in Wisconsin, genotypic analysis identi{ed B. gilchristii as the causative agent in a majority of cases. 9 Interestingly, isolates from adult patients from the same region were equally distributed between B. dermatitidis and B. gilchristii . 4
Infection has occurred in dogs, cats, cows, and other mammals, but zoonotic spread to humans has not occurred, except in very rare cases of dogs with oral lesions transmitting infection via bites. Likewise, person-to-person transmission is rare, with a single case of a  man with genitourinary disease transmitting pelvic blastomycosis to his wife, 10 and rare cases of intrauterine transmission from mother to child. 11

Blastomycosis
Unlike other endemic mycoses, such as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or penicilliosis, blastomycosis has only occasionally been reported as a signi{cant pathogen in patients with  AIDS.  When  it  does  occur  in  this  setting,  it  is  typically during advanced stages of AIDS with very low CD4 lymphocyte counts. The disease tends to be rapidly progressive, widely disseminated,  and  usually  fatal. 12 If  response  to  antifungal  agents occurs, the  patient  should be maintained on chronic secondary prophylaxis until immune reconstitution occurs. 13 Blastomycosis has  been  reported  in  patients  with  other  immunosuppressive conditions, such as organ transplantation, hematologic malignancies, corticosteroid use, and, more recently, tumor necrosis factor inhibitor use.

NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
The  portal  of  infection  is  the  lung,  via  inhalation  of  infective conidia, which are taken up by bronchopulmonary phagocytes. It is here that the fungus undergoes transformation into the yeast phase.  Pulmonary  infection  may  be  asymptomatic,  present  like an acute bacterial  pneumonia, or present with a more indolent chronic pneumonia with pulmonary nodules or cavitation. Signs and  symptoms  of  infection  after  hematogenous  spread  to  skin, bone, prostate, epididymis, or other organs may be non-speci{c. The in|ammatory response is a mixture of granulomatous and pyogenic elements (Fig. 87.1). Pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia and acanthosis are found in skin and mucous membrane lesions, which have prompted misdiagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma or keratoacanthoma in some patients. 3

Lung Lesions
Acute pulmonary blastomycosis can present as an asymptomatic radiographic in{ltrate or as a pneumonia that is indistinguishable from acute bacterial pneumonia with fever, chills, and productive cough with or without hemoptysis. Another presentation is several months of fever, night sweats, productive cough, and chest pain; this is typical for patients with chronic pulmonary blastomycosis. Adult respiratory  distress  syndrome  can  occur  in  patients  with miliary  or  endobronchial  spread  of  infection  and  is  associated with a high mortality.
Pulmonary  {ndings  are  present  radiologically  in  half  of patients.  The  radiologic appearance  can resemble bacterial pneumonia  in  patients  who  present  more  acutely  (Fig.  87.2) or  as  a  mass  lesion  in  patients  with  a  more  indolent  course. 14 Chronic  pulmonary  lesions  may  show  {brosis  and  cavitation. Calci{cation,  pleural  effusion,  or  hilar  adenopathy  are  rarely encountered.

============================================================
Skin Lesions
The  skin  is  the  most  common  extrapulmonary  site  of  infection,  with  40%  to  80%  of  patients  having  skin  involvement. 15 Lesions  are  often  multiple  and  tend  to  be  located  on  the  face and  extremities  (Fig.  87.3).  They  are  typically  erythematous, well-circumscribed,  hyperkeratotic,  crusted  nodules  or  plaques that enlarge over weeks. These lesions may ulcerate to leave an undermined edge. Some central healing can occur in chronic cases forming  a  hypopigmented,  atrophic,  {brotic  area.  Lesions  can also  occur  in  the  mucous  membranes  of  the  nose,  lips,  larynx, and vagina.

Bone Lesions
Osteomyelitis occurs in up to 25% of patients, affecting essentially any  bone. 3 Osteolytic  lesions  and  an  adjacent  cold  abscess  are typical features. In the majority, concomitant skin or lung infection allows the diagnosis to be made. The treatment course is usually of longer duration for bone infection. 13

Systemic Infections
Almost every organ has been infected with B. dermatitidis. Systemic signs  of  fever  and  weight  loss  are  mild  early  in  the  course  but become progressively more severe with disease extension. After a period of time ranging from weeks to years, chronic infection may disseminate to multiple organs and cause death if unrecognized.

Spontaneous  remission  is  rarely  observed  once  infection  has progressed beyond the lung.

PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Microscopic examination of stained histopathology or cytology specimens and culture of secretions or tissues remains the cornerstone of diagnosis for blastomycosis. When clinical suspicion is high, direct microscopic examination of sputum, skin, abscess |uid,  or  body  |uid  after  digestion  of  human  cells  with  10% potassium hydroxide or staining with calco|uor white or Papanicolaou's stain is the most rapid and effective means for diagnosis. The organism can be visualized in tissue specimens stained with methenamine silver or periodic acid-Schiff stains and appears as a yeast with a single, broad-based bud (Fig. 87.4). 15
Culture is positive in almost all cases. At room temperature, the organism will grow as a mold in 2 to 4 weeks on a wide range of culture media, including Sabouraud agar. Skin tests are neither helpful  nor  available.  Serology  using  a  variety  of  antigens  and methods is unreliable for diagnosis. 16 An assay to detect B. dermatitidis antigens in urine is available commercially and may be helpful, although signi{cant cross-reactivity has been noted with histoplasmosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, and penicilliosis. 17

Differential Diagnosis
Skin lesions may be mistaken for basal or squamous cell carcinoma. Nasal lesions  may  resemble  leishmaniasis  and  paracoccidioidomycosis.  Laryngeal  lesions  mimic  epidermoid  carcinoma,  both clinically and pathologically. Pulmonary blastomycosis may resemble tuberculosis and other granulomatous infections or bronchogenic carcinoma, both symptomatically and radiographically.

TREATMENT
The vast majority of patients coming to medical attention will need antifungal chemotherapy. 3 Oral itraconazole at a dose of 200 to 400 mg daily is now the recommended drug for all but the most severe cases. Amphotericin B was the drug of choice for all patients in the past and remains initial therapy for those with life-threatening blastomycosis or central nervous system (CNS) infection. 13 The deoxycholate formulation is given intravenously at a dose of 0.7 to 1 mg/kg daily. Alternatively, the liposomal formulation, which is preferred for CNS disease, can be given at 3 to 5 mg/kg daily with fewer side effects but at greater cost. Amphotericin formulations are typically given for 1 to 2 weeks (4-6 weeks for CNS disease) until improvement occurs, after which therapy can be completed with oral itraconazole. Non-life-threatening infections can be treated for the entire course with itraconazole alone. Itraconazole achieves cure rates of approximately 95% in those completing therapy. 18 It also has fewer adverse effects than amphotericin B. Fluconazole has lower success rates in treatment and requires much higher doses than itraconazole. A few cases have been successfully treated with newer-generation  azoles,  including  voriconazole,  posaconazole, or isavuconazole. 19,20
