- meningoencephalitis, pneumonitis, jaundice, hypotensive shock, and death.
- (chiggers) in a wider diversity of habitats than 'scrub' suggests.
- are inadequate.
- chloramphenicol-resistant O. tsutsugamushi exist in northern Thailand. Elsewhere, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, and rifampicin appear ef{cacious.

INTRODUCTION
Scrub  typhus  was  described  in  Japan  in  the  1800s  and  then  in Malaysia in the 1920s, where it was distinguished from murine typhus. It was a major clinical problem in many Asian theaters of the Second World War and the Indochina Wars. 1 Management was  transformed  by  chloramphenicol  and  the  tetracyclines.  It remains a major, under-appreciated cause of undifferentiated fever in Asia. Diagnosis is greatly hampered by the lack of accurate and accessible  laboratory  diagnosis.  Given  the  large  populations  of India and China, the numbers potentially exposed are enormous. With the growth of eco-tourism in Asia, more travelers are returning to non-endemic areas with this disease.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Scrub  typhus  occurs  in  the  most  populous  rural  areas  of  the world-across 13,000,000 km 2 from the Paci{c Rim,  Southeast Asia, northern  Australia, and northeast  Asia across South and Central Asia as far west as Uzbekistan and including the Maldives (Fig. 68.1). 1 This has been conventionally called the scrub typhus triangle, but it is more of a rhomboid than a triangle. There is increasing evidence that scrub typhus may be contracted outside this area, with autochthonous scrub typhus cases described in the Chiloé islands off the coast of Chile and serologic evidence that Orientia tsutsugamushi or a related species causes febrile illness in Kenyan children. 2,3 Recent evidence suggests that the large epidemics of acute encephalitis attributed to the Japanese encephalitis virus in northern India may be caused, at least in part, by scrub typhus. 4
There are no reliable estimates of community incidence and most are hospital derived, such as data showing that 3% of patients in Nepal and 15% of adult patients in Laos admitted with undifferentiated  fever  had  scrub  typhus. 5,6 It  predominantly  af|icts

Scrub Typhus
Paul N. Newton, Nicholas P. J. Day farmers, including their children, but may also affect urban populations  through  exposure  in gardens or visits  to  the  countryside. There are no known genetic predispositions. The name scrub typhus is  misleading,  as  the  disease  can  be  contracted  in  many  other habitats, including primary forest, beaches, gardens, and plantations. Indian patients with scrub typhus are more likely to have lived close to bushes and wood piles, to have worked on farms, to have seen rodents, and to have reared domestic animals, but are less likely to wash or change clothes after work. For Koreans, wearing a  long-sleeved  shirt  while  working,  keeping  work  clothes  off the  grass,  and  always  using  a  mat  to  rest  on  outdoors  were protective. 7
The most commonly reported serotypes are Karp, Kato, Gilliam, and Boryong, but the wide phenotypic and genotypic diversity of O. tsutsugamushi has major implications for the design of diagnostic tests and vaccines. 1

============================================================
NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
Scrub typhus is transmitted by chiggers-the third-stage larvae of Leptotrombidium mites (Fig. 68.2), which feed on the extracellular |uid of vertebrates such as rodents and humans. Mites are the main reservoir of O. tsutsugamushi, with the organisms maintained in  the  population  by  vertical  transovarial  transmission.  Blood transfusion and needlestick injury have been recorded as transmitting scrub typhus.
The  genome  of O.  tsutsugamushi ( ≈ 2  million  bp)  is  much larger  than  that  of  other  members  of  Rickettsiaceae  and is  the most highly repeated bacterial genome sequenced. 1 The median O. tsutsugamushi DNA load in blood is low ( ≈ 13 [0-310,253] copies/ mL); approximately half of patients have bacterial loads undetectable by current techniques. 8 Post-mortem examination has demonstrated O. tsutsugamushi in endothelial cells of major organs. Signi{cantly higher  concentrations  of  gamma  interferon  and  interleukin-10 occur during the acute than the convalescent phase. Comparison of patterns of endothelial and leukocyte activation in a range of 'typhus-like' illnesses suggest mononuclear cell activation in scrub typhus.  Evidence is accumulating that O.  tsutsugamushi exhibits tropism  for  mononuclear  cells  rather  than  endothelial  cells,  at least  in  early  infection. 9 Intriguingly,  evidence  from  Thailand suggests that HIV-1-suppressive factors are produced during some scrub typhus infections. There is increasing evidence that a second Orientia species, O. chuto , is a cause of human disease in the Middle East and possibly Africa. 10

CLINICAL FEATURES
The incubation period is approximately 6 to 14 days. T en to {fty percent of patients may have an eschar-this variability probably re|ects, at least in part, the extent to which patients are examined. Eschars, which are usually single and in secluded areas such as the axilla and groin, are painless, erythematous papules that develop a central black scab, resembling a cigarette burn (Fig. 68.3). They are not pathognomonic for scrub typhus, as similar lesions may be produced by spotted fever-group rickettsioses. Chiggers are minute and, unlike ticks, are not normally noticed. Patients may scratch off the characteristic black scab. Lymphadenopathy is more frequent than in sympatric murine typhus. 5 Headache, myalgia, and dry cough frequently occur; a maculopapular erythematous

CLINICAL FEATURES
rash  occurs  in  a  minority  of  patients. 1,5 Deafness,  tinnitus,  and conjunctival  suffusion  occur.  Severe  disease  can  manifest  as pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, jaundice with mildly raised transaminases, meningoencephalitis, coagulopathy, multi-organ failure, acute renal failure, acute transverse myelitis, myocarditis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Why some and not others  develop  severe  disease  is  not  understood.  Mortality  is positively correlated with blood bacterial load. 8 O. tsutsugamushi DNA has been demonstrated in cerebrospinal |uid (CSF), with normal  glucose,  a  mild  increase  in  white  cell  density  (ranging from 11%-88% lymphocytes) and raised protein. 11 Scrub typhus appears  to  be  less  severe  in  children,  but  there  have  been  no prospective comparisons between children and adults from the same population. Scrub typhus can cause serious adverse effects for mother and baby in pregnancy. 12 Although homologous strain immunity persists for at least 1 to 3 years, immunity to heterologous Orientia strains is as short as 1 month. There are few data on the dynamics of IgM/IgG responses-the annual reversion of scrub typhus patients sera back to a titer of < 13

============================================================
PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The majority of scrub typhus patients are not diagnosed or treated. A patient with fever, headache, and myalgia with an eschar in an endemic  area  is  likely  to  have  scrub  typhus.  The  differential diagnosis would include spotted fever-group rickettsiosis, which would also be expected to respond to tetracyclines. Scrub typhus eschars could be confused with the lesions of anthrax, tularemia, chancroid, lymphogranuloma venereum, and injury. In the absence of  an  eschar,  few  clinical  features  are  helpful.  Murine  typhus, leptospirosis,  Q  fever,  dengue,  hemorrhagic  fever  with  renal syndrome (HFRS), infectious mononucleosis, HIV seroconversion, septicemia  (especially  typhoid),  and  malaria  are  important  differential  diagnoses.  In  comparison  with  those  with  Q  fever, Taiwanese patients with scrub typhus had a higher frequency of residence  or  travel  in  a  mountainous  region  or  offshore  island and skin rash. In comparison to HFRS in China, eschar, regional lymphadenopathy, and maculopapular rash were more commonly found  in  patients  with  scrub  typhus.  In  Laos,  the  presence  of peripheral lymphadenopathy, chest signs, and eschars are clinically useful signs that suggest scrub, rather than murine, typhus. 5

============================================================
PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Laboratory  diagnosis  of  scrub  typhus  is  dif{cult.  Culture (requiring BSL3 facilities) is 100% speci{c but has low sensitivity. Immuno|uorescence (IFA) and immunoperoxidase IgM and IgG antibody tests have been commonly used, but these are expensive, are rarely accessible, and are bedeviled by subjectivity of interpretation and uncertainty as to the most appropriate cut-off titers in different  communities. 14 Ideally,  they  should  be  interpreted  by comparing titers between paired acute and convalescent samples. Karp, Gilliam, and Kato prototypic antigens are usually used in IFAs  and  therefore  may  not  detect  antibodies  to  other  strains. The Weil-Felix (WF) OXK test is still commonly used in Asia but has low sensitivity. Recently developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and serologically based rapid diagnostic tests have good sensitivity and speci{city and, when available, are replacing both the IFA and WF tests. Conventional and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for the detection of O.  tsutsugamushi in  blood,  eschar  tissue,  and CSF have  been developed. 15,16 However, there remain great dif{culties in diagnosing scrub typhus in rural endemic areas. Mixed infections may occur with,  for  example,  leptospirosis,  but  given  the  persistence  of antibodies,  distinguishing  these  from  serial  infections  without culture or PCR techniques is dif{cult.

============================================================
TREATMENT
Given the dif{culties of making a timely laboratory diagnosis and the  signi{cant  minority  who  develop  severe  disease,  empirical treatment should be considered for all patients with scrub typhus in  the  differential  diagnosis.  The  diversity  of O.  tsutsugamushi suggests it is unlikely that one treatment regimen will be appropriate across the wide distribution of this organism. Chloramphenicol- and doxycycline-resistant scrub typhus have been described in northern Thailand, 17 but there are no subsequent published data on this clinical problem.
Interpretation of data informing treatment decisions is dif{cult, as studies are few, often of small sample size, and 'relapses' were usually  not  proven  to  be  relapses  of  scrub  typhus  rather  than another  cause  of  fever  (T able  68.1).  Current  data  suggest  that

|uoroquinolones are inferior to doxycycline as therapy for scrub typhus. For uncomplicated disease, the data available do not allow generalizable conclusions of the duration of doxycycline therapy or whether a loading dose is required. In Laos and Thailand, a 7-day  treatment  course  of  2 mg/kg  twice  daily  after  a  loading dose of 4 mg/kg is administered. There is evidence from Malaysia that shorter courses may be ef{cacious. 18 Upper gastrointestinal side  effects  are  common;  patients  should  be  counseled  to  take doxycycline with plenty of |uid, during meals, and while sitting or  standing.  Chloramphenicol,  telithromycin,  rifampicin,  and azithromycin are potential alternatives. 19-24

CHUNK 11
============================================================
TREATMENT
There are few data to guide the antibiotic treatment of severe disease-parenteral or nasogastric doxycycline, azithromycin, and chloramphenicol  are  potential  options.  Appropriate  supportive care is essential. The treatment of scrub typhus in pregnancy is problematic-chloramphenicol (although contraindicated in the last trimester), azithromycin, and rifampicin have been used. In children, the risks of short-course doxycycline are almost certainly exceeded by the bene{t of effective cure. In a retrospective analysis of children with scrub typhus, no signi{cant differences in fever clearance times were found between doxycycline, chloramphenicol, and roxithromycin therapy. 25
Mortality is very variable, ranging from 0% to 70% in untreated patients  (median  6%),  for  reasons  that  are  unclear. 26 Delayed administration of doxycycline has been associated with major organ dysfunction and  prolonged  hospitalization,  emphasizing  the importance of early empirical doxycycline therapy. Relapse was described during volunteer experiments in Malaysia, but whether this is an important phenomenon in clinical practice is uncertain. Insecticides have been used to control chiggers, both in high-risk habitats  and  on  blankets  and  clothes,  but  neither  is  currently practical in rural Asia for farmers (who are at most risk of scrub typhus).
