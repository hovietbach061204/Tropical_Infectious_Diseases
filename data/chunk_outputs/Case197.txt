severely  immunocompromised,  including  individuals  with  AIDS, severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome, severe hypogammaglobulinemia,  or  lymphoma.  Such  extension  usually  involves  the biliary system and may include bile duct wall thickening, acalculus cholecystitis, sclerosing cholangitis, and  ampullary  stenosis  [4]. There  have  also  been  rare  reports  involving  severely  immunocompromised  individuals  with  cryptosporidial  involvement  extending into  the  respiratory  epithelium  lining  the  trachea,  bronchi,  and bronchioles [5, 6].

Protozoal organisms may be seen during histologic examination of tissue samples in a number of infectious processes other than toxoplasmosis, Chagas' disease, sarcocystosis and microsporidiosis. Leishmanial organisms infect monocytic and macrophage cell lines, and leishmaniasis is most commonly categorized as cutaneous, mucocutaneous or visceral (see Chapter 99). In immunocompetent individuals with leishmaniasis, the most commonly involved tissues include bone marrow, spleen, liver, lymph nodes, skin, and mucous membranes  of  the  nasopharyngeal  area.  In  immunocompromised  individuals, there may also be involvement of gastrointestinal tissues and mesenteric  lymph  nodes  [1,  2].  Histologic  examination  of  these tissues  will  disclose  intra-marcophage  protozoal Leishmania species parasites, often Leishmania donovani . Gastrointestinal involvement is most  commonly encountered  in  individuals  with  severe  immunocompromising  states,  including  advanced  HIV  infection  or  AIDS (most commonly in individuals with a CD4 count of < 200/mm 3 ). Immunocompromised individuals with gastrointestinal leishmaniasis may present with diarrhea, dysphagia, abdominal discomfort, and weight  loss.  Endoscopy  may  disclose  normal-appearing  superficial mucosa in almost half of cases [1]; however, histologic examination will disclose infiltration of the lamina propria and submucosal tissue with leishmanial-laden macrophages and monocytes. In rare cases, involvement  of  the  peritoneum  and  pleural  cavities  has  also  been described [3].
Similarly, cryptosporidiosis is most commonly considered an intracellular  protozoal  infection  of  the  intestinal  mucosal  epithelial surface  (see  Chapter  91).  However,  tissue  involvement  may  extend beyond  the  intestinal  epithelial  surface  in  individuals  who  are
