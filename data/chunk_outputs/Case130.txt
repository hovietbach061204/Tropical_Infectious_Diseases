- Diphtheria is a vaccine-preventable bacterial communicable disease caused by toxin-producing strains of Corynebacterium diphtheriae
- Transmission is person-to-person via respiratory droplets from the throat through coughing or sneezing, or by close contact with a skin lesion
- The incubation period is usually 1-5 days
- The disease is characterized by the presence of a tough pseudomembrane over the mucous membrane of the upper respiratory tract (nose, uvula, tonsils, pharynx, and larynx) or in skin ulcers in cutaneous diphtheria
- Symptoms and manifestations range from a moderately sore throat, to di)culty in swallowing and mild fever, to life-threatening airway obstruction, to toxin-related systemic complications, for example myocarditis and polyneuropathy (cranial and peripheral nerves)
- Early diagnosis and treatment with diphtheria antitoxin and antibiotics (penicillin, erythromycin) prevent complications and death
- Fatality rate ranges between 5 and 10 percent, even if properly treated, and can exceed 50% among untreated patients

INTRODUCTION
Diphtheria  is  an  acute  infectious  disease  that  is  caused  by  toxinproducing strains of Corynebacterium diphtheriae, a Gram-positve rod [1]. Two other zoonotic corynebacterial species, Corynebacterium ulcerans and Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, can also produce diphtheria  toxin.  Human  infections  by  toxigenic C.  ulcerans can  lead  to clinical disease indistinguishable from that caused by C. diphtheriae. Infections with C. pseudotuberculosis can cause caseous lymphadenitis in humans. Although diphtheria is an ancient communicable disease, its etiology was not discovered until the late 19th century (Box 37.1). Throughout history, and well into the first half of the 20th century, diphtheria was a fearful scourge and a major cause of death in children. From the late 1940s, widespread and routine use of diphtheria toxoid  vaccine  as  a  preventive  tool  led  to  a  dramatic  decline  in reported diphtheria worldwide (Fig. 37.1). Diphtheria is now virtually eliminated from industrialized countries as a result of sustained, high  childhood  vaccination  coverage  rates.  However,  the  disease remains endemic in countries with sub-optimal childhood vaccination coverage rates and poses a threat for importation into countries with good childhood programs but low booster immunization rates, or with significant clusters of susceptible populations [2].

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Humans  are  the  only  known  natural  reservoir  of C.  diphtheriae, although  the  organism  has  been  isolated  from  animals,  including horses. The organisms may survive for weeks on environmental surfaces, dust and fomites. In countries with a temperate climate, respiratory disease predominates, with a peak incidence during the autumn/ winter season. Transmission of C. diphtheriae occurs among close and susceptible contacts, and generally occurs through inhalation of respiratory droplets or through direct contact with respiratory secretions, infected skin lesions or fomites. While the majority of nasopharyngeal infections do not result in disease, transient carriage may occur and persist for several weeks, particularly in immunized persons. Asymptomatic carriers play an important role in maintaining transmission in the population. Patients with untreated clinical respiratory disease usually remain infectious for two weeks or less, but chronic carriage may occasionally occur after recovery. Individuals with symptomatic illness become non-infectious approximately two days after initiating effective antibiotic treatment; persistent carriage rarely occurs following  completion  of appropriate  antibiotic  therapy.  In  tropical  countries, cutaneous disease is more common and serves as an important reservoir  for  maintaining  transmission.  However,  in  industrialized countries, including the USA, small clusters of cutaneous disease have occurred among homeless individuals and alcoholic adults.

============================================================
EPIDEMIOLOGY
In  the  pre-vaccine  era,  diphtheria  was  a  major  cause  of  childhood morbidity  and  mortality.  Following  widespread  improvements  in vaccine coverage in most industrialized countries, disease caused by toxigenic C.  diphtheriae has  been  virtually  eliminated.  In  the  USA, reported cases declined dramatically from 147,991 in 1920, to 18,675 in 1945. Following the introduction of universal vaccination recommendations  in  the  mid-1940s  and  improving  vaccine  coverage, reported cases (irrespective of infection site) dropped precipitously to 59 in 1979. From 1980-2003, 55 cases of respiratory diphtheria were reported and, since 2003, no indigenous case has been reported in the USA. Although diphtheria has become rare in the USA and other developed countries, a large epidemic of diphtheria occurred in the newly  independent  states  of  the  former  Union  of  Soviet  Socialist Republics  (USSR)  with  more  than 157,000  cases  and  5000  deaths reported between 1989 and 1998. The major factors that contributed to the propagation of the outbreak included a decline in vaccination coverage among children, a mobile population, delayed recognition and response, and poor health infrastructure. The outbreak was controlled by campaigns of mass immunization with diphtheria toxoid to the entire population. Similarly, in developing countries, reported cases have dramatically declined since 1980 following the implementation of the World Health Organization (WHO) Expanded Program for Immunization. However, significant disparities exist among countries, with some countries achieving control of diphtheria similar to industrialized  countries  and  others  having  endemic  disease  and
periodic outbreaks. Vaccine-induced immunity to diphtheria wanes over time and, in the absence of booster immunizations, the number of susceptible persons in the population increases. Serologic surveys among adults in industrialized countries indicate that 20-60% have diphtheria antibody levels below minimal protective levels. A level of 0.01 IU/mL  from  an in  vitro neutralization  assay  is  considered  the lower limit of protection. When a critical proportion of the population becomes susceptible, there exists the danger of re-introduction or re-emergence of diphtheria and outbreaks [3].

- In 1888, Roux and Yersin demonstrated that the sterile @ltrate  from  cultured  bacteria  contained  a  heat-labile  toxin and that diphtheria  toxin  that  was  capable  of  producing identical diphtheria lesions.
- On  Christmas  Eve  of  1891,  Emil  Adolf  Behring  demonstrated  the  protective  value  of  diphtheria  antitoxin  in  a severely ill boy with diphtheria.
- In 1901, Behring received the Nobel Prize for work on the use  of  diphtheria  immune  serum  (diphtheria  antitoxin). Over 100 years later, equine diphtheria antitoxin continues to  be  the  hallmark  of  treatment  for  this  once  dreaded disease.
- In 1923, Ramon demonstrated the immunizing property of diphtheria toxin inactivated by heat and formalin to protect against disease and paved the way for the use of diphtheria toxoid (formalin-inactivated diphtheria toxin) as a vaccine.

============================================================
NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS AND PATHOLOGY
Corynebacterium  diphtheriae is  a  Gram-positive,  slender,  nonmotile, nonsporulating rod. Based on colony morphology and biochemical characteristics, four biotypes of C. diphtheriae (gravis, mitis, intermedius and belfanti) are recognized. Some strains produce a powerful diphtheria exotoxin. Before C. diphtheriae becomes toxigenic, it must be lysogenized by a specific bacteriophage. The corynebacteriophage carries the structural gene for the toxin ( tox ). Toxin-producing strains of all biotypes produce an identical diphtheria exotoxin [1]. No consistent  difference  in  pathogenicity  or  severity  of  disease  has  been demonstrated among the biotypes. Toxigenic strains of C. diphtheriae are not invasive but cause localized toxin-mediated disease in susceptible persons by colonizing the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract, or skin wounds and ulcers. Rarely, other mucosal sites, for example conjunctiva,  ear  and  vagina  may  be  infected.  After  inhalation,  the organisms proliferate at the colonized site and induce an inflammatory reaction in the mucosa of the nasopharynx, oropharynx, larynx or  trachea.  Inflammation  is  characterized  by  marked  neutrophilic infiltration, vascular congestion, and interstitial edema. Lysogenized organisms produce diphtheria toxin that inhibits intracellular protein synthesis and causes local epithelial necrosis with thick fibrinosuppurative  exudation.  Necrotic  debris,  exudate,  white  and  red  blood cells, fibrin and bacteria coagulate to form a dirty gray and adherent pseudomembrane over the mucosa. Expansion of the pseudomembrane  may  lead  to  life-threatening  respiratory  tract  obstruction. Attempts to remove the pseudomembrane usually result in bleeding at the site. With treatment or control of infection, the membrane may slough off from its vascular mucosal bed and result in bleeding and asphyxiation,  or  it  may  be  coughed  up.  Diphtheria  toxin  may  be absorbed from the site of infection into the bloodstream and transported to distant sites. Systemic absorption increases with expansion of the local inflammatory site and enlargement of pseudomembrane. In  the  absence  of  circulating

NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS AND PATHOLOGY
neutralizing  antibodies  to  diphtheria toxin,  extensive  toxin-mediated  end-organ  damage  may  occur,  particularly in the heart and peripheral neural tissue. Myocardial damage manifests as myocarditis that is characterized by edema, mononuclear cell infiltration and fatty changes, and focal necrosis in the myocardium and its conducting system. Polyneuropathy results from degeneration  of  the  myelin  sheath  and  axis  cylinder  of  the  cranial  or peripheral nerves. Occasionally, in the kidneys, acute tubular necrosis may lead to renal failure [4, 5].
Infection by nontoxigenic C. diphtheriae may be associated with sore throat  without  pseudomembrane  formation,  but  with  invasive disease. Bacteremia, endocarditis, aneurysms, osteomyelitis and septic arthritis have been reported among clusters of drug addicts, alcoholics, homeless individuals and Australian aboriginals.

============================================================
CLINICAL FEATURES
Infection usually results from exposure to respiratory secretions from cases or carriers, or exudates from cutaneous lesions. The incubation period is usually from 1-5 days, but occasionally can be longer. The frequency and severity of clinical symptoms and signs depend on the site  of  infection,  size  of  the  pseudomembrane  and  the  patient's immunization history.  However,  regardless  of  the  site  of  infection, systemic manifestations are similar and consequent to absorption of diphtheria toxin from these sites. The disease is usually localized to mucous membrane in the upper respiratory tract, the skin, or both. Symptoms and signs can develop at multiple sites in the upper respiratory tract, including the nose, pharynx, tonsils and larynx [5]. The characteristic feature of diphtheria is the formation of a tough, dirtygray, leather-like pseudomembrane at the site of infection.
The most common site for respiratory diphtheria is the faucial area including  the  posterior  pharynx,  soft  palate,  periglottal  area,  uvula and tonsillar mucosa (Fig. 37.2). The onset is usually insidious and patients usually present with a low-grade fever ( < 103°F), sore throat, pain on swallowing, hoarseness of voice, pharyngeal injection, nasal discharge, cough, malaise and prostration [5, 6]. The pulse is usually more rapid than the fever would justify. On initial examination, the pharynx is injected, but patches of exudates may appear a day after illness onset. These patches may expand and coalesce to form a whiteto-dirty-gray,  tenacious  membrane  over  one  or  both  tonsils,  the nasopharynx, uvula and soft palate, and can extend downward into the larynx and trachea. The edge of the membrane is surrounded by a narrow zone of erythema and a broader zone of mucosal edema. Cervical lymph nodes are usually tender and enlarged and, along with cervical soft tissue edema, gives rise to the so-called bull-neck appearance and may cause respiratory stridor. Extension of the pseudomembrane from the pharynx to the larynx can result in life-threatening airway obstruction.

============================================================
CHUNK 8
============================================================
CLINICAL FEATURES
The laryngeal or tracheobronchial mucosa may be the primary site of infection in 5% of patients. However, tonsillopharyngeal membrane may  extend  downward  into  the  larynx  in  about  10%  of  patients. Laryngeal diphtheria typically presents with hoarseness and stridor, dyspnea  and  a  brassy  cough.  Edema  and  membrane  formation

involving the larynx, or trachea and bronchi may narrow the lumen of the airways, particularly in infants and young children, and progress to dyspnea, exhaustion and death.
Nasal diphtheria is more frequent among infants and young children who  usually  present  with  a  profuse  mucoid,  serosanguineous,  or mucopurulent nasal discharge that can cause an erosive reaction on the external nares and upper lip. A dirty-white membrane is usually present on the nasal septum. The symptoms are generally mild and manifestations of systemic toxicity are rare.

============================================================
CHUNK 9
============================================================
CLINICAL FEATURES
Cutaneous  diphtheria  is  usually  more  common  in  warm,  tropical climates and is normally associated with colonization of pre-existing skin  lesions,  such  as  surgical  wounds,  pyoderma,  eczema,  burns, impetigo, psoriasis and insect bites. Co-infection with Staphylococcus aureus and  group  A Streptococcus  pyogenes is  typical.  Outbreaks  of cutaneous diphtheria have occurred among impoverished or indigent populations,  homeless  individuals  and  alcoholics,  and  in  environments with overcrowding and unhygienic living arrangements. The disease classically presents as single or multiple punched-out ulcers with  rolled-out  margins  and  a  dirty-gray  or  black  adherent  pseudomembrane  over  the  base.  Common  sites  for  cutaneous  lesions include the lower legs (Fig. 37.3), feet and hands. Lesions from which C.  diphtheriae are  isolated  are  indolent,  nonprogressive,  superficial and indistinguishable from those caused by other bacteria. Although systemic complications rarely occur from local absorption of toxin in cutaneous diphtheria, sufficient  toxin may be  absorbed  to act  as  a natural  immunizing  event  to  induce  production  of  high  antitoxin levels  and  protective  immunity.  If  untreated,  cutaneous  diphtheria may persist for months. Shedding of C. diphtheria from skin lesions occurs over a longer time period than from respiratory tract colonization, and exudates from cutaneous diphtheria can contaminate the environment and may be an important and efficient means of personto-person spread in tropical countries [7].
Rarely, the primary site of infection may be the mucous membranes at  other  localized  sites,  such  as  the  conjunctiva,  external  auditory canal and vulva [5]. A local ulcer with exudate or pseudomembrane may be present and, in the ear, diphtheria may manifest as a chronic purulent discharge. However, lesions are self-limiting and rarely associated with systemic toxicity.

CLINICAL FEATURES
Complications frequently  result  from  systemic  absorption  of  diphtheria  toxin,  particularly  in  the  heart,  nerves  and  kidneys.  Cardiac manifestations generally occur during the second week, but may occasionally be present from the first week or manifest as late as the sixth week of illness.  The  risk  of  myocarditis  directly  correlates  with  the duration, extent and severity of disease, and delay in initiating treatment  with  diphtheria  antitoxin  [5].  Diphtheritic  myocarditis  can

CLINICAL FEATURES
present  as  a  wide  variety  of  abnormalities  that  includes  dyspnea, angina, syncope, diminished heart sounds, new or altered murmurs, conductive disturbance arrhythmias, ectopic beats, a gallop rhythm, cardiac enlargement, low cardiac output or hypotension. Although up to 65% of patients have electrocardiographic (ECG) evidence of myocarditis after 1-2 weeks from onset, most are asymptomatic. Clinically significant myocarditis develops in 7-20% of patients with respiratory diphtheria compared with 0-5% with cutaneous diphtheria. Abnormalities  in  ECG  pattern,  particularly  ST-T  wave  changes  and  firstdegree  heart  block,  can  progress  to  more  severe  forms  of  block, atrioventricular dissociation and other arrhythmias that carry a poor prognosis.  Patients  with  ECG  findings  that  do  not  exceed  ectopic supraventricular beat, sinus bradycardia, prolonged P-R interval and minor T-wave changes generally do well and are associated with little, if  any,  increased  risk  of  death.  Patients  with  single  bundle  branch blocks, QRS widening, ST-T segment shifts, T wave inversions, prolonged QT wave intervals or supraventricular tachycardias are associated  with  a  10-50%  mortality.  The  fatality  rate  exceeds  90%  in patients with third-degree block, more than two ventricular premature  contractions,  ventricular  tachycardia  and  congestive  cardiac failure. Cardiac pacing appears to be of little value in patients with third-degree block. These patients have severe cardiac injury and die from congestive cardiac failure or ventricular tachycardia. Death from myocarditis  occurs  within  two  weeks  of  illness  onset.  Abatement of ECG abnormalities reflects improving cardiac function and favors survival.  Elevations  of  serum  creatine  kinase  and  serum  aspartate aminotransaminase/serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (AST/ SGOT)  concentration  closely  parallel  the  intensity  of  myocarditis and so may be used to monitor its course. Detectable cardiac injury may completely resolve over months, or even years, but some survivors are left with persistent conduction defects requiring long-term follow-up [8].

============================================================
CHUNK 12
============================================================
CLINICAL FEATURES
Approximately  two-thirds  of  individuals  with  severe  diphtheria develop neuropathy. Affected patients develop palatine and posterior pharyngeal wall paralysis and cranial neuropathies involving muscles of the eye, face, pharynx and larynx, causing dysphagia and predisposing these patients to nasal regurgitation and  aspiration. The ocular manifestations  of  diphtheria  include  blurred  vision  and  failure  of accommodation. Later, several weeks after the sore throat, a peripheral motor demyelinating neuritis can occur, beginning in the proximal muscle groups in the extremities and progressing distally. In the lower  extremity,  the  dorsiflexors  of  the  feet  may  be  particularly affected.  Occasionally,  motor  nerves  of  the  trunk,  neck  and  upper extremity are involved (as are sensory nerves) resulting in a glove-andstocking neuropathy. Generally, there is slow but total resolution of the limb weakness [9, 10].
Less  commonly,  renal  failure  and  pneumonia  may  occur  in  severe cases. Rare instances of encephalitis and cerebral infarction have been documented.  Case  fatality  rates  have  remained  stable  at  ~10%  in developed countries over the past five decades and are highest in the very young and very old; fatal outcomes are rare in fully vaccinated persons [1 1].

CHUNK 13
============================================================
PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Respiratory diphtheria should be suspected in the presence of a gray pseudomembrane in a patient with sore throat, mild fever, cervical lymphadenopathy, neck  swelling,  hoarseness  of  voice  and  signs  of systemic toxicity. The diagnosis is confirmed by culturing toxigenic C. diphtheriae from  swabs  taken  from  the  throat,  respiratory  tract  or membrane [12, 13]. Throat swab specimens should be taken before administration  of  antibiotics  to  increase  the  chance  of  a  positive culture  and  immediately  transported  to  the  laboratory.  If  clinical specimens cannot be immediately transported, they should be sent in a transport medium or, if a long delay is anticipated, in silica gel. Specimen culture optimally requires the use of a tellurite-containing medium. Identification of C. diphtheriae and its biotypes is made from colony  morphology (black colonies  with  a  surrounding  halo)  and
from biochemical tests. Toxigenicity  of C.  diphtheriae can  be  determined by in vivo (guinea pig) or in vitro (Elek) testing. PCR tests for gene coding for the A and B fragments of the exotoxin can confirm the  presence  of  toxigenic  organisms,  but  not  toxin.  PCR  testing  is sensitive  and  rapid  and  is  most  useful  in  specimens  taken  from patients who received antibiotics. However, it is currently only available at some reference laboratories. Molecular subtyping of C. diphtheriae strains  shows  considerable promise in aiding epidemiologic investigations and is available at some reference laboratories [13].
The differential diagnosis includes streptococcal or viral tonsillopharyngitis,  infectious mononucleosis, Vincent's angina,  herpetic tonsillitis, thrush and acute epiglottitis.

============================================================
CHUNK 14
============================================================
TREATMENT
The hallmark of treatment of respiratory diphtheria is prompt administration of diphtheria antitoxin to neutralize free circulating diphtheria toxin; diphtheria antitoxin cannot neutralize cell-bound toxin. The antitoxin, an equine antiserum, is critical in the management of respiratory diphtheria and is effective in reducing the extent and severity of  local disease,  as  well  as  the  risk  of  systemic  complications,  such as  myocarditis and polyneuropathy. As the patient's condition may deteriorate rapidly,  a single dose of diphtheria  antitoxin  should be promptly administered if diphtheria  is  strongly  suspected,  without awaiting laboratory confirmation of the clinical diagnosis [12]. Early institution of antitoxin therapy is associated with a significant reduction in mortality risk. As diphtheria antitoxin is an equine product, skin testing should be performed prior to administration to rule out immediate-type hypersensitivity. Patients who exhibit hypersensitivity require desensitization before a full therapeutic dose of antitoxin is administered. Irrespective of the patient's age, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend intravenous administration of 20,000-40,000 units of diphtheria antitoxin for pharyngeal or laryngeal disease of less than 2 days' duration, 40,000-60,000 units for  cases  with  nasopharyngeal  pseudomembrane  formation,  and 80,000-100,000 units for disease with duration of 3 days or more or extensive disease with neck swelling. A repeat dose is of no benefit and may increase the risk of anaphylaxis to horse serum protein. In the USA, diphtheria antitoxin is no longer manufactured or licensed for use. However, it is available from CDC under a Food and Drug Administration  (FDA)-approved  investigational  new  drug  protocol. Physicians  in  the  USA  may  obtain  diphtheria  antitoxin  by  calling the Emergency Operations Center of the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention  at  770-488-7100;  additional  information  may  be obtained  from  the  CDC  website  http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpdvac/diphtheria/dat/dat-main.htm. Diphtheria antitoxin may be produced and available locally outside the USA.

============================================================
CHUNK 15
============================================================
TREATMENT
The  administration  of  recommended  antibiotic  therapy  serves  to eliminate the organism, thereby stopping toxin production, improving local symptoms and signs of infection, and preventing spread of the organisms to susceptible contacts. Patients should be maintained in strict droplet isolation throughout therapy. Respiratory diphtheria should be treated with penicillin or erythromycin - the antibiotics of choice [12, 14, 15]. Both drugs are equally effective in resolving local symptoms  and  disappearance  of  the  pseudomembrane.  Procaine penicillin  G  is  given  at  a  dosage  of  600,000  units  (for  children, 12,500-25,000 IU/kg)  intramuscularly  (IM)  every  12 h  until  the patient can swallow comfortably, after which oral penicillin V is given at 125-250 mg four times daily to complete a 14-day course. Alternatively, erythromycin is given at a dosage of 500 mg IV every 6 h (for children, 40-50 mg/kg per day IV in two or four divided doses) until the patient can swallow comfortably, after which 500 mg is given PO four times daily to complete a 14-day course. A single, IM dose of benzathine penicillin G (600,000-1,200,000 units) may be considered when compliance with oral therapy is uncertain. Erythromycin is marginally superior to penicillin in eradicating the carrier state and may  be  preferred  for  initial  treatment;  however,  there  is  increased risk  of  gastrointestinal  irritation  and  intolerance  when  given orally and thrombophlebitis when administered intravenously. Alternative agents  for  patients  who  are  allergic  to  penicillin  or  cannot  take
erythromycin include rifampin and clindamycin. Cutaneous diphtheria  should  be  treated  with  antibiotics  as  described  for  respiratory disease, but patients seldom require antitoxin. It is important to treat the underlying cause of the dermatoses in addition to the co-infection with C. diphtheriae .

============================================================
CHUNK 16
============================================================
TREATMENT
Following  therapy,  eradication  of C.  diphtheriae should  be  documented by two consecutive negative cultures at 24-hour intervals and taken at least 1 day after antimicrobial therapy is complete. A repeat throat culture two weeks later is recommended. For patients in whom the organism is not eradicated after a 14-day course of erythromycin or penicillin, an additional 10-day course followed by repeat culture is  recommended. Treatment of acute diphtheria with prednisone is of limited, or no, value and does not reduce the incidence of myocarditis or polyneuropathy [12].

============================================================
CHUNK 17
============================================================
TREATMENT
Supportive  care  is  very  important.  Patients  in  whom  diphtheria  is confirmed  should  be  hospitalized  in  respiratory-droplet  isolation rooms. Bed rest is  recommended  during the acute phase of illness (the  first  2-3 weeks from onset of illness),  but proof of its benefit once the patient feels able to ambulate is lacking. Early in the disease, cardiac and respiratory complications can occur. ECG abnormalities secondary to myocarditis can occur within three days from onset of disease and progress to cardiogenic shock within a week. As significant  ECG  abnormalities  may  develop  in  patients  without  clinical evidence  of  myocarditis,  it  is  important  to  routinely  monitor  their cardiograms. Cardiac complications can be detected and minimized by close ECG monitoring and initiation of indicated supportive care, including  inotropy,  after-load  reduction  and  pacing.  From  a  prognostic standpoint, patients with ECG changes of myocarditis have a mortality  rate  3-4  times  higher  than  those  with  normal  tracings. Airway obstruction can result from aspiration of dislodged pharyngeal membrane, its direct extension into the larynx or from external compression  by  enlarged  nodes  and  edema.  Consultation  with  an anesthesiologist or an ear, nose and throat specialist is recommended because  of  the  possibility  that  tracheostomy  or  intubation  will  be required to access and remove tracheobronchial membranes and to eliminate the risk of sudden asphyxia. Patients should also be monitored for development of primary or secondary pneumonia. While awaiting return of neurologic function in patients with neuropathies, physical therapy is indicated to maintain range of motion in paretic extremities. In addition, nasogastric tube-feeding may be required in patients who have palatine or pharyngeal paralysis to prevent aspiration.  Protective  or  long-term  immunity  may  not  occur  in  cases  of diphtheria - diphtheria toxoid is administered during the convalescent phase to boost immunity and prevent recurrence [1 1, 12, 14, 15].

============================================================
CHUNK 18
============================================================
PREVENTION
Immunization with diphtheria toxoid is the most effective means of primary  prevention. Diphtheria toxoid  is available  in  combination with tetanus toxoid (DT) and whole-cell pertussis (DTwP) or acellular pertussis  antigens  (DTaP)  for  use  in  children < 7  years  of  age;  the antigenic content of diphtheria toxoid in these preparations ranges from 6.7-15 limit of flocculation (Lf) units. Because the frequency and severity of local reactions from diphtheria toxoid increases with age, a combination vaccine (Td or Tdap) with lower antigenic content ( ≤ 2 Lf units) is used in children ≥ 7 years or older and adults. In the USA,  the  Advisory  Committee  on  Immunization  Practices  recommends  that  three  doses  of  diphtheria  toxoid-containing  vaccine (DTaP, DTwP or DT) be given to children at 4- to 8-week intervals beginning at 2 months of age, a fourth dose at 15-18 months, and a preschool booster dose at 4-6 years of age.  An adolescent  booster with  tetanus  toxoid  and  a  reduced  diphtheria  toxoid  and  acellular pertussis antigens (Tdap) is recommended at 1 1-12 years of age, followed thereafter by a decennial Td booster dose. For added protection against pertussis in adults, a Td booster dose may be substituted with
Tdap if they have not previously received a Tdap dose. For persons in whom pertussis vaccine is contraindicated, DT and Td should be used instead of DTaP/DTwP and Tdap respectively. Unvaccinated individuals who are ≥ 7 years of age should receive a three-dose primary series with Td with the first two doses given at 4-8-week intervals and the third  dose  6-12  months  later.  Booster  doses  are  recommended  at 10-year intervals [15, 16].

============================================================
CHUNK 19
============================================================
PREVENTION
The childhood vaccination schedule varies in developing countries. The  WHO's  Expanded  Program  on  Immunization  recommends  a three-dose primary immunization series with combined diphtheria and  tetanus  toxoids  and  pertussis  vaccines  (DTwP)  starting  at  six weeks of age and administered at least four weeks apart. Some countries recommend one or two additional booster doses to be given at 12 months of age and at school entry. The vaccination strategy for decennial booster doses varies by country and depends on vaccine resources, the capacity of immunization services and the epidemiologic pattern of diphtheria. While some developed countries routinely offer an adolescent dose, most countries do not recommend an adult booster dose [17].
