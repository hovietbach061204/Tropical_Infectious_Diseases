Key features
- Intestinal %ukes are primarily distributed in Asia, although Heterophyidae species are also seen in North Africa and the Middle East
- Humans acquire infection by eating raw contaminated water plants, for example Fasciolopsis buski , by ingesting raw freshwater &sh, for example Heterophyidae , or through uncooked snails, snakes, or frogs
- Most infections are asymptomatic; diarrhea and abdominal pain are common complaints in symptomatic patients
- Malabsorption and protein-losing enteropathy can be seen in severe F. buski infection, particularly in children
- Therapy of intestinal %ukes is with praziquantel

INTRODUCTION
Intestinal flukes vary in size from large to minute. There are over 70 species that infect humans. The majority of infections are caused by flukes from the families Fasciolidae, Echinostomatidae , and Heterophyidae (Table 123-1). A smaller number are caused by the Gastrodiscidae, Plagiorchiidae, Microphallidae , and Diplostomatidae families (Table 1231). Many species have been discovered incidentally by identification of adult worms in stool after anthelminthic treatment [1]. The source of  infection  varies  according  to  the  intermediate  host,  for  example infected freshwater fish, aquatic plants, snails, or tadpoles.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
More than 50 million people are infected by intestinal flukes [2]. Most cases have been reported from Southeast Asia, the Far East, the Middle East, and Africa. On a few occasions, cases have been reported from Europe,  North  America,  or  Australia.  Intestinal  flukes  have  been reported from:
- Fasciolopsis buski: India, Thailand, Loa People's Democratic Republic (PDR), Cambodia, Indonesia, Taiwan, China, Japan, Malaysia, and the Philippines;
- Echinostomatidae species:  north-eastern  Thailand  (about  50% prevalence), the Philippines, Indonesia, and Taiwan;
- Heterophyidae species, usually Heterophyes heterophyes and Metagonimus yokogawai : Nile delta of Egypt, Iran, Tunisia, Turkey, Southeast Asia and the Far East, such as Japan, Korea, Taiwan, mainland China, the Philippines, and Indonesia;
- Gastrodiscidae species  ( G.  hominis ):  common  in  Asia  especially in  India  (Assam,  Bihar,  and  Orissa).  Cases  also  reported  from Vietnam,  Thailand,  Myanmar,  China,  the  Philippines,  Kazakhstan, and Guyana. Reservoir hosts are pigs, deer mice (Tragulus
- napu) , and  rats. It has been  proposed  that  sylvanic  cycles persist [3];
- Lecithodendriidae species  ( Phaneropsolus  bonnei and Prosthodendrium  molenkempi ):  endemic  in  Southeast  Asia,  especially  Thailand, Lao PDR, and Indonesia [4].

============================================================
NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
The lifecycles of most intestinal flukes are similar except for the intermediate hosts. Adult flukes reside in the intestines of the definitive hosts and release eggs that are passed in stool. When the embryonated eggs  reach  water,  they  release  miracidia  which  penetrate  the  snail intermediate host and develop into sporocysts, radiae and then cercariae.  Cercariae  leave  the  snails  and,  depending  on  the  species  of fluke,  encyst  as  metacercariae  on  aquatic  plants,  in  fish,  freshwater snails,  snakes,  or  frogs  (Table  123-2).  Humans,  or  other  definitive hosts,  become  infected  after  eating  metacercariae  in  uncooked infected  or  contaminated  second  intermediate  hosts.  Metacercariae excyst in the duodenum, attach to the intestinal wall and develop into adult worms that produce eggs and complete the lifecycle.
When flukes attach to the intestinal wall they can cause inflammation with cellular infiltration, ulceration  and increased mucus secretion. Heavy infection can lead to local necrosis, erosion and hemorrhage. Intestinal  obstruction  can  occur  with  heavy  worm  burden.  Malabsorption and protein-losing enteropathy can occur in severe cases of F. buski infection. Occasionally, ova or adult worms of minute intestinal flukes (e.g. Heterophidiae ) can enter blood vessels and travel to ectopic sites, such as the heart or brain.

CLINICAL FEATURES
Most cases are asymptomatic and are discovered after anthelminthic treatment for other conditions. Symptomatic cases report mild gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, colic, flatulence, and diarrhea,  which  can  be  watery  or  foul-smelling  with  mucus  and blood.  Severe  infection  with F.  buski in  children  can  present  with chronic  diarrhea  and  protein  losing  enteropathy.  Rarely,  intestinal perforation occurs, which can be fatal [5].

Physical examination shows no abnormality in asymptomatic or mild cases. In severe cases, protein malnutrition, anemia and edema of the face and extremities can be detected caused by chronic protein and blood loss and B12 malabsorption [6]. There are occasional reports of  infection  at  ectopic  sites  from  some  species,  for  example Alaria Americana , that has caused lesions in the vitreous and the retina [7], and has disseminated throughout the body [8].

PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Routine laboratory tests are usually normal in mild cases. Anemia and eosinophilia  can  be  seen  in  severe  cases  of F.  buski .  Low  serum albumin and B12 level has occurred with protein-losing enteropathy.
Confirmatory diagnosis is made by:
1. Identification of adult worms, with specific species confirmation based on the worm characteristics.
2. Identification of ova in fecal samples: It can be difficult to diagnose worm species because the ova of these parasites are similar to others in the same family or the liver fluke species, for example F. buski is similar to Fasciola hepatica or Fasciola gigantica ova, and minute intestinal flukes ova, for example H. heterophyes , Prostodendrium molenkampi , Phaneropsolus bonnei , M. yokogawai ova are similar to O. viverrini , O. felineus , and C. sinensis ova.
3. The sensitivity of  the  above  methods  can  be enhan  ced  by using the methiolate iodine-formaline (MIF) technique [9].
3. PCR: PCR distinguishes intestinal flukes based on their DNA sequences. Using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism  (PCR-RFLP)  and  simple  sequence  repeat  anchored PCR, differentiation among various species of Metagonimus genus [10, 1 1] and six species of Heterophyidae genus has been possible [12].
4. Serology:  similar  to  most  intestinal  parasitic  infections, serology  is  not  routinely  performed.  However,  in  patients infected with multiple pathogens, it can be useful for confirmation, for example F. buski and F. gigantica [13].
Other intestinal parasites or liver flukes can give similar symptoms of abdominal pain, flatulence, and diarrhea. Severe cases may be similar to intestinal schistosomiasis but without liver or splenic enlargement. Risk factors based on endemic area, eating  habits, or travel history should be carefully elicited. Co-infection with other intestinal can be common in endemic areas.

TREATMENT
Praziquantel is the anthelminthic of choice. One field trial of treatment for F. buski demonstrated that praziquantel 15 mg/kg orally in a single dose at bedtime gave a 100% cure rate and was similar to the higher dose praziquantel (25 or 40 mg/kg), but with fewer side effects [14].  The  Medical  Letter  recommends  75 mg/kg  in  three  divided doses [15].
There have been no controlled trials of praziquantel for other intestinal flukes. However praziquantel at 15, 25, or 40 mg/kg in a single oral dose has been used successfully [16].

PREVENTION
Important methods to prevent infection are proper cleaning of raw water plants and cooking of vegetables, freshwater fish, or other intermediate hosts before consumption. Improved sanitation and hygiene will help to prevent fecal contamination of freshwater.
