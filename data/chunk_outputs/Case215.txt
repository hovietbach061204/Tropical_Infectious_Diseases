Liver Fluke Infections 124
Yupaporn Wattanagoon, Danai Bunnag
- Clonorchis and Opisthorchis reside in the biliary tree; acute symptoms are more common with O. felineus . Chronic infection with these species is strongly associated with cholangiocarcinoma
- Symptoms with Fasciola occur during migration of the (uke through liver parenchyma or during ectopic migration
- Opisthorchis and Clonorchis are acquired through ingestion of raw or undercooked cyprinid )sh (e.g. carp) containing infective metacercariae and Fasciola after eating freshwater plants with encysted metacercariae. Herbivorous animals are the usual hosts of Fasciola spp.
- Detection of characteristic ova in stool is the usual mode of diagnosis. Serology can also be useful
- Treatment of Opisthorchis and Clonorchis is usually with praziquantel, whereas Fasciola is treated with triclabendazole

INTRODUCTION
Opisthorchiasis and clonorchiasis are caused by liver flukes in the genus Opisthorchiadae and Clonorchiadae . The three most common species  causing  disease  in  humans  are Opisthorchis  viverrini,  O. felineus , and Clonorchis sinensis .

============================================================
CHUNK 3
============================================================
EPIDEMIOLOGY
Opisthorchis viverrini is  endemic  in  Southeast Asia - mainly Thailand,  Lao  People's  Democratic  Republic,  the  southern  part  of Vietnam, and Cambodia. The prevalence in north-eastern Thailand was as high as 90% during  the 1980s and remains around 20%, despite control measures. Opisthorchis felineus is endemic in Russia and Eastern Europe, and C.  sinensis is  common in Korea, China, and northern Vietnam.  In endemic areas, children as young as 1 year old have been infected with O. viverrini .

============================================================
CHUNK 4
============================================================
NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
Humans  are  an  incidental  host  of O.  viverrini,  O.  felineus ,  and Clonorchis  sinensis .  Consumption of raw or undercooked cyprinid fish (e.g. carp) containing metacercaria - the infective stage of these flukes - results in infection. The metacercaria, released in the intestine, move through the Ampula of Vater into the common bile duct to  the  gallbladder  and  the  peripheral  bile  ducts  in  the  liver,  and develop into adult worms (Fig. 124.1). Adult worms release eggs that are passed in the feces. Once in freshwater, the eggs hatch and release  miracidia  that  are  taken  up  by  snails  in  which  parasite amplification occurs. Cercariae emerge from snails and infect susceptible fresh water fish, encysting as metacercariae.
The presence of adult worms in the bile duct causes chronic irritation;  the  worms  also  release  toxic  metabolic  substances.  The immune response leads to infiltration with eosinophils and mononuclear cells in periductal areas; secondary bacterial infections can occur. There is bile duct epithelial cell desquamation, epithelial cell hyperplasia  and  glandular  proliferation  (Fig.  124.2).  Intrahepatic bile ducts become dilated with distal clubbing and cystic changes. The gallbladder can be dilated and contain whitish bile [1], and its wall  can  demonstrate  hypertrophic  epithelial  cells.  Severity  of pathology  depends  on  both  intensity  and  duration  of  infection. The chronic changes combined with endogenous  and exogenous carcinogens,  notably  nitrosamines,  induce  mutagenic  changes  in the bile duct epithelium and can lead to cholangiocarcinoma.

============================================================
CHUNK 5
============================================================
CLINICAL FEATURES
Acute symptoms are more common with C. sinensis and O. felineus infection  and  are  rare  with O.  viverrini .  High  fever,  arthralgia, myalgia, lymph node enlargement, eosinophilia and, occasionally, facial edema can occur after 2-3 weeks of infection during worm migration and development [2]. As the worms are not yet mature, ova will  not  be  detected  in  the  feces  at  this  stage.  Illness  usually

lasts for 1-2 weeks. Allergic hepatitis is occasionally observed, especially in severe cases.
Chronic infections are usually asymptomatic. Most infections are detected by routine stool examination. In symptomatic cases, nonspecific symptoms, such as lassitude, anorexia, flatulence, abdominal  discomfort,  poor  appetite,  and  occasional  loose  stools  are complaints. A peculiar hot sensation over the right upper abdomen is  a  characteristic  symptom  found  in O.  viverrini infection.  Lowgrade fever and hepatomegaly can be found on examination [3].
Complications such as relapsing cholangitis or abscess caused by secondary bacterial infections are common in advanced infection. Patients  present  with  fever,  jaundice,  and  abdominal  pain  with hepatomegaly and an enlarged gallbladder. Cholangiocarcinoma is highly  associated  with  opisthorchis  and  clonorchis  infection  [4], especially  when  combined  with  consumption  of  a  diet  high  in nitrosamines.  Animal  studies  have  documented  that  hamsters infected with O. viverrini developed cholangiocarcinoma when fed a high nitrosamine diet [5].

============================================================
PATIENT EVALUATION AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
As patients with early or mild infection can be asymptomatic, diagnosis usually relies on routine stool examination. People in endemic areas  who  eat  uncooked  fish  and  have  nonspecific  abdominal symptoms should have yearly  stool examinations  for Opisthorchis or Clornorchis ova. However, these ova can be difficult to differentiate  from  flukes  present  in  the  small  intestine  [6].  Patients  with intestinal fluke infection usually have chronic watery diarrhea.
Acute opisthorchiasis or clonorchiasis are differentiated from acute fascioliasis,  acute  schistosomiasis  and  other  tissue  parasites  by exposure history and epidemiology.
In late-stage disease, patients can present with obstructive jaundice, cholangitis,  or  cholangiocarcinoma;  other  causes  of  obstructive jaundice, such as biliary tract stones, should be investigated.

============================================================
CHUNK 7
============================================================
DIAGNOSIS
Stool examination for Opisthorchis or Clonorchis ova is the standard for diagnosis. Other specimens that can be used for ova detection are  duodenal  fluid  or  bile  collected  via  endoscopic  retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or during surgery.
Serology can  be  used  for  diagnosis  of  acute  infection,  but  is  not helpful  in  chronic  infection  or  re-infection  in  endemic  areas,  as a positive  antibody  will  persist  after  treatment.  Detection  of co-proantigen can be used as a 'test of cure' after treatment.
PCR can detect Opisthorchis DNA in fecal samples and distinguish it  from  intestinal  flukes  with  high  sensitivity  and  specificity.  It  is also useful for epidemiologic surveys [7].
Ultrasonography  of  the  liver  and  gallbladder  in  early  infections usually  shows  an  enlarged  non-functioning  gall  bladder  with sludge.  Later  stage  infections  can  show  dilatation  of  intrahepatic bile  ducts  or  a  mass.  A  liver  mass  with  intralesional  bile  duct dilatation  is  suggestive  of  cholangiocarcinoma.  Cholangiography was  performed  before  the  availability  of  computed  tomography (CT)  or  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI).  Dilated  intrahepatic bile  ducts  with  distal  clubbing  may  be  visualized  (Fig.  124.3),
as  well  as  occasional  filling  defects  owing  to  the  presence  of adult  flukes  (Fig.  124.4).  CT  or  MRI  is  useful  for  staging  of cholangiocarcinoma.

============================================================
CHUNK 8
============================================================
OPISTHORCHIS VIVERRINI
Praziquantel  is  the  drug  of  choice.  At  a  dose  of  25 mg/kg  body weight orally three times over 1-2 days, the cure rate was 100% [8]. A single dose of 40 mg/kg at bedtime gave a 91-95% cure, while a dose  of  50 mg/kg  gave  97%  cure  rate  but  with  a  higher  rate  of adverse events [9, 10]. Therefore, praziquantel, 40 mg/kg, is recommended for mass treatment.
Albendazole  at  400 mg  twice  daily  for  3-7  days  yielded  only  a 40-63% cure rate [11].

============================================================
CHUNK 9
============================================================
CLONORCHIS SINENSIS
Praziquantel is effective for clonorchiasis. Twenty-five mg/kg, three times  per  day for  1 day yields  an 85% cure  rate,  while the  same dose given for 2 days cures up to 100%. A single dose of 40 mg/kg yielded only a 25% cure rate [12].
Patients with secondary cholangitis should be treated with antimicrobials.  Cholangiocarcinoma,  if  detected  early,  can  be  resected. However if  detected  late,  palliative  treatment  by  drainage  of  bile can help to relieve symptoms of obstructive jaundice. The prognosis is poor for these patients as chemotherapy or radiation therapy are usually not effective for cholangiocarcinoma.

============================================================
INTRODUCTION
Fascioliasis is infection by sheep liver flukes, Fasciola spp. The two species that infect humans are Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica (Fig. 124.5) Other herbivorous animals such as cattle, goats, water buffalo, horses, camels, hogs, rabbits, and deer can be infected with Fasciola spp .

============================================================
CHUNK 11
============================================================
EPIDEMIOLOGY
Human fascioliasis  has  been  reported  worldwide.  Endemic  areas are South America, the Middle East, Asia, Africa, Europe, and the USA.

============================================================
PREVENTION AND CONTROL
Thorough cooking of fish is the best way to prevent infection. This should be enforced through continuous health education in endemic areas.  Control  measures  through  mass  treatment  programs  and improving sanitation can reduce the prevalence.

============================================================
CHUNK 13
============================================================
NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
Humans acquire Fasciola after ingestion of aquatic plants, such as fresh  watercress,  that are contaminated with Fasciola  metacercaria . The metacercaria excyst in the duodenum and penetrate through the  intestinal  wall  into  the  peritoneal  cavity.  They  enter  the  liver through Glisson's  capsule,  moving through the liver parenchyma to their final habitat - the bile ducts - where they attain maturity and begin laying eggs. The immature parasites can wander, causing ectopic foci in organs such as the heart, lung, brain, and subcutaneous tissues.
The  pathologic  changes  in  human  fascioliasis  are  related  to  the stages of infection. In the early stage of immature worm migration (migratory phase), the young flukes create migratory tracts in the liver parenchyma, producing subcapsular hemorrhages and hepatic necrosis with cellular infiltration of eosinophils and lymphocytes, leading  to  hepatic  abscesses  and,  finally,  fibrosis.  Common  bile duct obstruction rarely occurs. Once reaching the large bile duct, adult flukes cause hyperplasia, desquamation and cystic dilatation of bile ducts. Ectopic fascioliasis is common.

============================================================
CHUNK 14
============================================================
CLINICAL FEATURES
Human  fascioliasis  is  usually  mild.  Clinical  symptoms  can  be described in relation to the phases of infection.

============================================================
CHUNK 15
============================================================
MIGRATORY PHASE
Symptoms  occur  when  young  flukes  migrate  through  the  liver capsule  and  parenchyma  before  reaching  the  bile  ducts.  They include  dyspepsia,  anorexia,  nausea,  vomiting,  pain  in  the  right

hypochondrium, and hepatomegaly. Urticaria and eosinophilia are common.

============================================================
CHUNK 16
============================================================
BILIARY TRACT INFECTION
Once the flukes reside in the bile ducts, most patients have no clinical  symptoms.  On  rare  occasions,  bile  duct  occlusion  can  occur leading to signs and symptoms of obstructive jaundice or pancreatitis.  In  highly  endemic  areas, growth  stunting in  children occurs [13].

============================================================
CHUNK 17
============================================================
Ectopic Fascioliasis
Clinical symptoms and signs depend on the site of infection. Parasitic tracts, nodules or abnormal masses can be found in subcutaneous tissues (Fig.  124.6), the intestinal wall, lung, heart,  or  brain, and can be accompanied by hemorrhage, for example intracranial hemorrahge.

============================================================
CHUNK 18
============================================================
Pharyngeal Form
The pharyngeal form is caused by consumption of young flukes in infected livers of goats or sheep. The flukes attach to the mucosa of laryngopharyngeal tissue causing localized edema of the pharynx or larynx leading to dysphagia and dyspnea. Patients can die from asphyxia if not recognized.

============================================================
CHUNK 19
============================================================
PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The  standard method  of diagnosis  is  detection  of Fasciola ova  in fecal samples. Ova should be differentiated from Fasciolopsis buski ova, which is a large intestinal fluke. Eggs can also be found in bile or duodenal aspirate.
Serologic  diagnosis  is  useful  for  diagnosis  of  acute  phase  and ectopic fascioliasis as stool examination  will  be negative in these patients. Detection of antibody by ELISA or immunoblots using F. gigantica excretory  secretory  antigen  have  high  sensitivity  and specificity.
Recovery  of  adult  worms  from  surgical  or  autopsy  specimens,  or stool collection after treatment, can help to confirm the diagnosis.
Radiologic examinations including ultrasonography and CT of the liver are helpful, especially during the hepatic or migratory phase. Subcapsular hypodense areas and intrahepatic hypoechoic nodular lesions with poorly defined contours may be found on ultrasonogram. CT can show multiple hypodense nodules and tunnel-like, branching  hypodense  tracts  representing  the  migratory  tracts  of young  flukes  [14].  During  the  biliary  phase,  adult  fasciola  may appear as a leaf-like echogenic object without acoustic shadow in the gallbladder or common bile ducts [15]. Filling defects owing to the presence of adult fasciola in the bile duct can also be demonstrated  during  endoscopic  retrograde  cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).

============================================================
CHUNK 20
============================================================
TREATMENT
Following reports of the failure of praziquantel in fascioliasis, triclabendazole, nitazoxanide, and artesunate have been tried. Praziquantel at 25mg/ kg three times daily for 1-2 days was only partially effective  in  treating  fascioliasis.  Triclabendazole  10 mg/kg  single dose, or two doses for 1 day, is effective, with cure rates of 79% and 92% respectively.  A  randomized  placebo-controlled  trial  of  nitazoxanide 500 mg twice daily for 7 days gave a 60% cure rate. Children aged 4-11 years old were given a dose of 200 mg twice daily and children aged 2-3 years old received 100 mg twice daily for 7 days; this resulted in a 40% cure rate [16]. A randomized, controlled trial  compared  triclabendazole  10 mg/kg  for  two  doses  at  12-h intervals  and  artesunate  4 mg/kg  once  a  day  for  10  days  for  the treatment of acute fascioliasis in  Vietnam. Artesunate-treated patients were significantly more likely to be free of abdominal pain, but were less likely to be symptom-free 3 months after treatment (76% vs. 92%) [17].
Surgical resection or ERCP removal of adult flukes can be done in cases with biliary tract obstruction.

============================================================
CHUNK 21
============================================================
PREVENTION AND CONTROL
Proper cooking or cleaning of aquatic plants before consumption will prevent accidental Fasciola infection. In endemic areas, adequate mass chemotherapy of infected animals and proper sanitary protection of pastures are important control measures.

============================================================
CHUNK 22
============================================================
INTRODUCTION
Dicroceliasis and eurytremiasis are caused by the liver flukes Dicrocoelium dendriticum and Eurytrema pancreaticum . Herbivorous animals  such  as  sheep,  goats,  and  cattle  are  the  natural  host. Humans are accidental hosts.

============================================================
CHUNK 23
============================================================
EPIDEMIOLOGY
Dicroceliasis is common in animals in Europe, northern Africa and parts  of  the  Far  East,  and  is  less  common  in  North  and  South America. Only a few human cases have been reported, mainly from Europe.
Eurytrema pancreaticum has been reported from autopsy findings in China  and  Japan  [18].  Animal  infections  have  been  reported  in cattle, water buffalo, sheep, and goats in Asia and occasionally in camels  and  monkeys  in  northern  China,  Brazil,  Venezuela,  and Madagascar.

============================================================
CHUNK 24
============================================================
NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
Humans acquire dicroceliasis by accidental ingestion of food contaminated with infected ants of the species, Formica fusa, which is the second intermediate host. Acquisition of eurytremiasis follows accidental ingestion of food contaminated with infected grasshoppers or crickets - the second intermediate host. In both infections, metacercaria  excyst  in  the  duodenum  and  migrate  through  the ampula of Vater. For dicroceliasis, they move retrograde to the bile ducts where they develop into adult worms. In eurytremiasis, they move retrograde to the pancreatic duct and, rarely, the bile ducts, where  they  develop  into  adult  worms.  Pathologic  changes  are similar to those of Opisthorchis infections.

============================================================
CHUNK 25
============================================================
CLINICAL FEATURES
There  have  been  only  rare  documented  cases  of  re-infection.  In dicroceliasis,  dyspepsia,  abdominal  pain,  flatulence,  and  watery diarrhea  have  been  reported  [19].  In  eurytremiasis,  symptoms include  abdominal  distress,  dyspepsia,  vomiting,  and  diarrhea. Occasionally  jaundice  and  an  enlarged  tender  liver  have  been documented.

============================================================
CHUNK 26
============================================================
DIAGNOSIS
Demonstration of ova of each species in fecal specimens is diagnostic. Spurious infection should be suspected if patients have a history of raw sheep liver consumption. Patients should be put on a liverfree diet for 3 days and a repeat stool examination performed.

============================================================
CHUNK 27
============================================================
TREATMENT
No therapeutic  trials  have  been  conducted.  Praziquantel  25 mg/kg three times a day for 1 day or triclabendazole 10 mg/kg single dose after a meal have both been used successfully in single case treatment of dicroceliasis [19]. Most cases of eurytremiasis have been successfully treated with praziquantel 25 mg/kg three times a day for 1 day.
