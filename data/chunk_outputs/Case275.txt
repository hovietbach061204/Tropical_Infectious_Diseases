Introduction
Trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide and is caused by recurrent episodes of infection with Chlamydia trachomatis. The Alliance for the Global Elimination of Blinding Trachoma by the year 2020 (GET 2020) was established by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1997 and has helped to coordinate trachoma control efforts. The recent Global T rachoma Mapping  Project  has  established  where  current  control  efforts need to be concentrated. 1

============================================================
Epidemiology
Blinding trachoma is endemic in at least 20 countries, largely in poor  and  remote  areas  across  Africa,  Asia,  Latin  America,  the Middle East, and the Paci{c Rim. 2,3 In 2016 there were an estimated 190 million people living in regions requiring trachoma control programs, 3.1 million who require surgery for trichiasis, and 1.9 million who are blind or have signi{cant visual impairment from trachoma. 2-5 The vast majority of these people live in the African region.
Trachoma prevalence estimates  need to be interpreted with some caution, as various assumptions and extrapolations are used, and there is a relative lack of data from India and China. Small changes in the prevalence of either of these countries potentially has a large effect overall. However, it is clear that the numbers estimated to be affected by trachoma have shown large reductions in recent decades, and the number of countries that are thought to have eliminated trachoma (at least the active form) is increasing. This is probably partly a result of trachoma control strategies and general improvements in living and hygiene standards.
Loss of vision and ocular pain from trachoma lead to loss of economic  productivity  and  quality  of  life,  with  the  burden  of disease estimated to be around 1.3 million disability-adjusted life years in 2004, although this is likely to be an under-estimation. 6-8 Trachoma tends to be found in remote, rural areas; is strongly associated with poverty; and perpetuates the cycle of poverty and blindness. 9,10

Clinical Features and Natural History
Trachoma is a chronic keratoconjunctivitis caused by recurrent infection with C. trachomatis. Infection is most commonly found in children who manifest the 'active' forms of the disease. With repeated  episodes  of  reinfection,  these  children  are  at  risk  of developing the scarring complications of trachoma in later life. Active disease is characterized by a follicular and papillary conjunctivitis. Follicles are sub-epithelial collections of lymphoid cells and appear as small, yellow-white elevations on the conjunctiva of  the  everted  upper  lid  (Fig.  39.1).  Papillary  hypertrophy

Vascular in{ltration  of  the  upper  cornea  (pannus)  may  also  develop  in active disease, although this tends not to affect vision. Individuals are often asymptomatic even with marked signs of in|ammation. If present, symptoms are typical of those of a chronic conjunctivitis: redness, discomfort, light sensitivity, and muco-purulent discharge. All children in an endemic area will be infected at some point in their life and often on multiple occasions.
The prevalence of active disease and C. trachomatis infection is highest in young children and declines to low levels in adulthood (Fig. 39.2). Active disease can be found in 60% of children under the age of 5 years, and half of the community bacterial load of C. trachomatis can be found in children under the age of 1 year in some studies. 11-13 However,  despite  low  levels  of C.  trachomatis infection in adults, the disease continues to progressively manifest its scarring sequelae. Initially, conjunctival scarring is seen in the sub-tarsal conjunctiva, which can range from a few linear or stellate scars to thick, distorting bands of {brosis. Contraction of this scar tissue causes entropion (in-turning of the eyelids) and trachomatous trichiasis (eyelashes touching the eyeball). Eventually, the blinding end stage of the disease develops-corneal opaci{cation-which is probably a result of a number of insults to the ocular surface: mechanical  trauma  from  lashes,  secondary  bacterial  or  fungal infection, and a dry ocular surface. In contrast to other common causes  of  blindness  such  as  cataract  or  uncorrected  refraction, blindness  from  trachoma  can  be  debilitating,  painful,  and,  in practice, irreversible.

The development of conjunctival scarring is strongly associated with previous conjunctival in|ammation. 16 A subgroup of children may have persistent infection and persistent, severe in|ammation and are at increased risk of  developing scarring. 17 Estimates  of the  progression  rate  for  scarring  trachoma  have  been  variable depending on the study site, burden of disease, and study methodology. 16 A  strong  association  between  progressive  scarring  and conjunctival in|ammation is also seen, but evidence for the role of C. trachomatis in scarring progression is limited, with infection rarely found in adults with scarring. Part of the reason for this may be because episodes of infection in adults, with the development of some protective immunity, are shorter and  more dif{cult to detect. 18 Alternatively,  other  factors,  such  as  non-chlamydial bacterial infection, may be important in driving the scarring process in adults. 19

============================================================
CHUNK 10
============================================================
Chlamydia Biology
C.  trachomatis is  a  small,  gram-negative,  obligate  intracellular bacterium and only naturally infects humans. Trachoma is caused almost exclusively by the serotypes A, B, Ba, and C. The genital serotypes D-K can also cause a follicular 'inclusion' conjunctivitis. The basis for the tissue tropism is not completely clear, with ompA typing probably not as reliable as previously thought, but ocular serotypes have lost the ability to synthesize tryptophan. 17 C.  trachomatis has  developed  ways  of  evading  the  host  immune response, with a unique developmental life cycle involving intracellular  invasion. An extracellular,  infectious  form, the  elementary body, is around 0.5 μ m in diameter, is metabolically inert, and is taken  up  by  epithelial  cells  into  intracellular  inclusion  bodies. Here  they  transform  into  reticulate  bodies  that  are  1.5 μ m  in diameter and multiply by binary {ssion until there are thousands of organisms in the host cell inclusion bodies. The reticulate bodies then transform back into elementary bodies and are released by lysis of the host cell. This cycle takes between 24 and 48 hours in vitro .

============================================================
CHUNK 11
============================================================
Histopathology
A mixed in|ammatory cell in{ltrate is seen in active trachoma, with macrophages, T cells, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, dendritic cells, and plasma cells. 17,20 Lymphoid follicles are the clinical and pathologic hallmark of trachoma. They are found in the stroma and consist largely of B cells with some macrophages and T cells with a surrounding lymphocytic mantle. Adults with scarring have a chronic in|ammatory cell in{ltrate with an abnormal or denuded epithelium.  Thick,  compact,  and  avascular  scar  tissue  is  found under the epithelium, which is {rmly adherent to the tarsal plate.

============================================================
CHUNK 12
============================================================
Protective Immune Responses
An innate immune response is triggered by infection with release of a large array of in|ammatory and chemotactic cytokines, many from the conjunctival epithelium. 20 Animal models of genital tract infection  suggest  that  clearance  of  infection  is  dependent  on  a type 1 T-helper cell response mediated through IFN γ . 21,22  IFN γ has a number of anti-chlamydial actions, including depleting the levels of the essential amino acid tryptophan and iron and upregulating inducible nitric oxide synthase. A partial, protective immune response  has  been  found  after  ocular C.  trachomatis infection, although this is only serovar speci{c. 20 Longitudinal studies have shown that the duration of infection and disease decreases with age,  and  this  is  probably  a  result  of  T-cell-dependent  immune responses. The role of humoral immunity is less clear.

============================================================
CHUNK 13
============================================================
Immunopathology
Host immune responses are central to the development of pathology in trachoma, leading to scarring complications and loss of vision. Previous lines of investigation have led to the suggestion that a cell-mediated immune response to speci{c chlamydial antigens leads to tissue damage and {brosis. 23,24 Animal studies suggested that  chlamydial  heat  shock  protein  60,  cHsp60,  may  be  a  key antigen leading to in|ammation and {brosis, with a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction proposed. 20 However, human studies have not been supportive of the role of cHsp60 in pathogenesis. More recent work involving conjunctival transcriptome studies and animal models of genital tract infection have supported the role of infected epithelial  cells  driving  pathogenesis  through  innate  pathways. Epithelial cells infected with C. trachomatis produce a large range of pro-in|ammatory cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. The subsequent recruitment of in|ammatory immune cells, which help  to  clear  infection,  also  cause  tissue  damage  and  {brosis. 25 Non-chlamydial bacterial  pathogens  have  been associated  with trachoma and may also stimulate innate, pro-in|ammatory pathways leading to scarring progression. 19 Host factors are also likely to be important, with 39% of the variability in lymphoproliferative responses to C.  trachomatis antigens  estimated  to  be  a  result  of host genetic factors. 26

============================================================
CHUNK 14
============================================================
Transmission and Risk Factors
C.  trachomatis is  probably  transmitted  between  individuals  by  a variety of mechanisms, including direct spread from eye to eye or indirect spread of ocular and nasal secretions on {ngers, through use of contaminated fomites such as clothing, and possible transmission  by  eye-seeking |ies. 27 T rachoma is  a focal  disease and  has been found to cluster at the level of the community, the household, and within bedrooms, re|ecting the infectious nature of the disease and suggesting that prolonged contact is necessary for transmission of infection. No non-human reservoir has been found, with eyeseeking |ies acting only as passive vectors.
A number of environmental, socio-economic, and behavioral factors have been associated with trachoma, although the interpretation of studies and potential confounding factors can be complex. 9,17,20 Clean faces have been strongly linked with a lower risk  of  trachoma,  and  poor  access  to  water  increases  the  risk. However, how water is used and changing facial hygiene practices are  complex  issues  with  studies  sometimes  showing  con|icting results. Overcrowding appears to be a risk factor for trachoma,
with easier transfer of infected secretions. Women tend to have more scarring complications, thought to re|ect increased contact with small children, the main reservoir of infection. Eye-seeking |ies such as Musca sorbens may transmit trachoma, and reducing |y-eye contact through insecticide spraying or latrine provision lowers the risk, although trachoma can occur in the absence of |ies.

CHUNK 15
============================================================
Clinical Examination
The WHO de{nes trachoma as a public health problem when the prevalence of follicular trachoma, TF, is at least 10% in 1- to 9-year-olds, or the prevalence of trachomatous trichiasis, TT, is at least 1% in those over 14 years of age. 28 A population-based prevalence  survey,  with  cluster  random  sampling,  gives  good prevalence  data on active disease  and trichiasis and is  the gold standard for assessing where trachoma is a public health problem. 27 Clinical examination using the simpli{ed WHO grading system is employed. The Global Trachoma Mapping Project has recently completed  comprehensive  global  trachoma  surveys  to  guide trachoma control programs. 29,30

============================================================
CHUNK 16
============================================================
Laboratory Tests
Earlier  techniques  for  detecting  ocular C.  trachomatis infection have included  Giemsa  staining  and  microscopy  of  conjunctival samples,  tissue  culture  (highly  speci{c  but  expensive  and  time consuming), and direct immuno|uorescent cytology and enzyme immunoassay (EIA) (T able 39.2). However, these have largely been superseded by nucleic acid ampli{cation tests. Ampli{cation of C. trachomatis DNA or RNA from ocular swabs is highly sensitive and speci{c. It is also relatively expensive and requires good laboratory  access. An area of concern is  a  mismatch  that  often  exists between laboratory testing and clinical examination, especially in low-prevalence settings and those that have received mass treatment. 19 This may be partly explained by the kinetics of the disease, with a latent phase (infection before signs) and a recovery phase (infection cleared but clinical signs of active trachoma persisting for many months), and the use of simple grading systems that do not  re|ect  the  spectrum  of  disease  severity.  The  much  higher
TABLE 39.2 Methods Used for Laboratory Diagnosis of Trachoma
levels of clinically detectable active trachoma compared with actual C. trachomatis infection, especially after mass antibiotic treatment, has raised the question of whether clinical examination is adequate to guide further management. 17,19 Hopes for an inexpensive, reliable, {eld-based assay have not been realized, but selective testing of representative  samples  and  shared  used  of  laboratory  facilities with other programs may help overcome reliance on clinical grading alone. 17

Differential Diagnosis
There are differential diagnoses to consider in the diagnosis of both  active  trachoma  and  trachomatous  scarring  (T able  39.3). However, in  the  absence  of  laboratory  tests,  cases  of  follicular conjunctivitis and/or conjunctival scarring in known trachomaendemic areas, or that have risk factors for trachoma, are generally regarded as trachoma.

Surgery for Trichiasis
The aim of surgery is to stop eyelashes abrading the cornea, reduce progression  to  corneal  opacity,  and  relieve  pain.  Currently  the WHO recommends the use of either the bilamellar tarsal rotation or the posterior lamellar tarsal rotation procedure to correct the trichiasis, with the posterior procedure recently reported to have better outcomes. 32-34 Surgery has been shown to improve comfort, reduce ocular discharge, and improve visual acuity in trichiaisis cases,  and  is  thought  to  reduce  progression  to  corneal  opacity. Major challenges need to be overcome for successful implementation  of  a  trichiasis  surgery  program,  including  high  recurrence rates; lack of training, equipment, and audit; low surgical productivity at outreach campaigns; and loss of surgeons to other jobs. 19,27 Patient barriers to surgery include fear, lack of awareness, perceived costs, transport dif{culties, other responsibilities, and lack of an escort.

Antibiotics for C. trachomatis Infection
Mass antibiotic treatment of a community reduces the reservoir of C. trachomatis infection. 36  The WHO recommends community mass  treatment  of  all  people  over  6  months  of  age  where  the prevalence of active trachoma in children aged 1 to 9 years is over 10%, and coverage should be at least 80%. 37 First-line treatment is  a  single  oral  dose  of  the  macrolide  antibiotic  azithromycin (20 mg/kg, maximum 1 gram), which is generally extremely safe and well tolerated. T opical tetracycline ointment is an alternative, but this requires a 6-week course and adherence to treatment is often poor. Large-scale antibiotic distribution has only been possible through  P{zer's  donation  program  through  the  International Trachoma Initiative. Community mass treatment should continue until  the  prevalence  of  follicular  trachoma  in  1- to 9-year-olds falls  below  5%. Where  the  starting  district-level  prevalence  of active disease is 10% to 30% mass treatment should continue for 3 years and then prevalence reassessed; where the starting prevalence  is  above  30%  mass  treatment  should  be  continued  for  5 years before reassessment. If the starting district-level prevalence is between 5% and 9% then targeted treatment is recommended at  the  sub-district  level.  There  has  been  considerable  debate, generation of studies, and mathematical modeling regarding optimal frequency  and  duration  of  treatment.  In  very  high-prevalence communities biannual treatment may be more effective, and in low-prevalence communities a shorter duration of treatment may be adequate. However, in the absence of widespread testing for C. trachomatis infection WHO guidelines remain the best guide for treatment. 17 Coverage rates in national programs may also be conspicuously lower than in research studies.

Antibiotics for C. trachomatis Infection
Resistance to azithromycin has not been observed in C. trachomatis. After multiple rounds of mass treatment with azithromycin, there  is  a  shift  in  the  prevalent Streptococcus  pneumoniae strains carried in the nasopharynx to ones with greater macrolide resistance. However, this appears to be a temporary shift, with the prevalent strains  tending  to  revert  back  to  the  pattern  that  preceded  the introduction of treatment after this has been discontinued. 38 Recent studies have shown that azithromycin distribution has been associated  with  signi{cant  reductions  in  diarrhea,  respiratory  tract infections, and a 50% reduction in childhood mortality. 19 These additional bene{ts need careful consideration and follow-up in future studies.

CHUNK 24
============================================================
Facial Cleanliness and Environmental Improvements to Interrupt C. trachomatis Transmission
The presence of ocular and/or nasal discharge has been consistently associated with trachoma, but may be a result of trachoma rather than a risk factor for transmission. Although the causative relationship  between  dirty  faces and  trachoma  is  not completely  clear, and  evidence  that  promotion  of  face  washing  actually  reduces the  prevalence  of  active  trachoma  is  limited,  facial  hygiene  is generally considered an important modi{able risk factor. 39 Trachoma was once a major problem in Europe and North America and disappeared from these areas as a result of improved living conditions rather than mass antibiotic distribution. Environmental interventions involve components such as improving water and latrine access and use, reducing |y density, and providing health education. Without addressing these underlying hygiene issues, attempts  to  eliminate C.  trachomatis infection  with  antibiotics alone  are  likely  to  lead  to  recurrence  once  distribution  ceases. However, the evidence base for environmental improvements is poor and implementation in national trachoma control programs often limited or non-existent. 27,40 Integration with national hygiene and  sanitation  programs  may  bene{t  this  aspect  of  trachoma control. 17

Conclusion
The  goal  of  eliminating  blinding  trachoma  by  2020  has  seen encouraging progress with reductions, particularly in active disease, in many countries. Concerted implementation of all components of the SAFE strategy is likely to have the most success in reducing blinding disease, and integration with control strategies for other neglected tropical diseases may provide a cost-effective way forward. Trachoma still  continues  to  be  a  major  problem  in  poor,  rural areas in many countries, and there is a large backlog of trichiasis cases that needs to be addressed. There is also a large cohort of people with a history of recurrent C.  trachomatis infection  who remain at risk of future scarring complications.

Epidemiology
C.  trachomatis infection  is  the  most  common  bacterial  sexually transmitted infection worldwide. 41 There were an estimated 131 million  new  cases  of  chlamydia  among  15-  to  49-year-olds  in 2012, with the incidence highest among young women. The highest prevalence was in the region of the Americas and the Western Paci{c region, but genital chlamydial infection is found worldwide.
In  contrast  to  trachoma,  genital  disease  is  caused  by  serotypes D-K, as discussed in the trachoma section earlier. The prevalence of C.  trachomatis in  pregnant  women  ranges  from  2%  to  20% depending on the population screened, with those under 25 years having the largest burden of infection. 42-47

============================================================
CHUNK 27
============================================================
Clinical Features and Transmission
The majority of those with genital tract C. trachomatis infection are asymptomatic, with implications for control measures, discussed later. Historical contact tracing studies reported genital infections from C. trachomatis to be asymptomatic in around 70% of women and 50% of men. 48 However, these early studies were conducted using tests that have been superseded by more recent work using nucleic  acid  ampli{cation,  which  has  shown that asymptomatic infection is actually even more common: between 70% and 95.5% in women, and 25% to 100% in men. 49,50 Urogenital symptoms in women include abnormal vaginal discharge, dysuria, and postcoital  and  intermenstrual  bleeding.  If  infection  ascends  to  the upper reproductive tract, then pelvic in|ammatory disease, salpingitis, and tubal factor infertility can result. Symptoms in men include urethral discharge, dysuria, and testicular pain.
Transmission to the eye in adult inclusion conjunctivitis (AIC) is by autoinoculation in the vast majority of cases, either genitalhand-eye  or  genital-eye,  with  the  infected  genital  secretions originating  from either the patient or partner. The majority of affected  patients  have  concomitant  genital  disease. 51 Neonatal inclusion conjunctivitis (NIC) is usually transmitted by contact with infected secretions in the birth canal during delivery. A handful of  cases  have  also  been  reported  where  infection  has  occurred after  cesarean  section  in  the  presence  of  ruptured  membranes and, more rarely, with intact membranes. 52-54 The risk of transmission of C. trachomatis to an infant born through an infected birth canal has been reported to be approximately 50%, with the risk of chlamydial conjunctivitis in the order of 20% to 35% and 15% to  20%  developing  pneumonia. 55,56 With  modern  detection techniques, these rates would be expected to be higher.

Clinical Features and Transmission
Ocular  features  in AIC  typically  develop  5  to  14  days  after inoculation, presenting as an acute follicular conjunctivitis with redness and mucopurulent discharge. The follicular response is often more prominent in the lower tarsal conjunctiva and fornix, in contrast to trachoma. The infection is usually unilateral to start with, but may spread to the other eye, and is frequently associated with pre-auricular lymphadenopathy. Super{cial punctate keratitis, peripheral  sub-epithelial  in{ltrates,  or  pannus  of  the  superior cornea may occur with time. NIC usually develops 5 to 14 days after birth, often with redness of both eyes. This may be associated with some discharge, lid swelling, pseudomembranes, and a papillary reaction, but the immune response is too immature to develop a follicular response at this stage. Rarely, conjunctival scarring and corneal pannus may develop in untreated cases. Although many cases of AIC and NIC may be self-limiting regarding the ocular disease,  it  can  be  critical  to  make  the  correct  diagnosis  so  that appropriate systemic treatment is administered.

Patient Evaluation, Diagnosis, and Differential Diagnosis
Inclusion conjunctivitis is usually diagnosed clinically and con{rmed by laboratory testing (see T able 39.2). Culture from a swab containing  conjunctival  epithelial  cells  was  the  'gold  standard'  for diagnosis, with high speci{city and moderate sensitivity, dependent on user expertise. EIA and direct |uorescent antibody assays (DFAs) have high speci{city, but sensitivity may be limited by the type of kit used. Nucleic acid ampli{cation techniques (e.g., polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) have higher sensitivity than culture methods while retaining high speci{city and thus have replaced the other techniques. If resources are limited, Giemsa-stained conjunctival scrapings  can  be  examined  for  the  presence  of  blue-stained intracytoplasmic inclusions within epithelial cells.
When inclusion conjunctivitis is identi{ed in children beyond the  neonatal  period,  child  sexual  abuse  must  be  considered. 57 Although  persistence  of  infection  has  been  reported  for  up  to 3 years, there must be a high index of suspicion for sexual abuse, regardless of the age of the child. In post-pubertal girls consensual sexual activity should also be considered. 58
The differential diagnosis of AIC is similar to the differential of active trachoma (see T able 39.3). The most important differential diagnosis in neonates is conjunctivitis caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. However, this usually occurs earlier (2-5 days after birth) and is rapidly progressive, with a thick, purulent discharge and marked edema of the eyelids and conjunctiva. If possible, taking appropriate ocular samples is extremely important in all cases of neonatal conjunctivitis for microscopy, culture, and PCR to detect the causative micro-organism.

Treatment
The recommended treatment in adults and children (over 8 years of age and 45 kg in weight) with inclusion conjunctivitis is a single dose of oral azithromycin 1 g or doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for 7 days. 59-61 In the UK there is a move away from use of the single dose of azithromycin with the appearance of rapidly emerging resistance to Mycoplasma genitalium, in addition to the evidence  that  a  single  dose  of  azithromycin  is  less  effective  in treatment of rectal  chlamydia. 62 Doxycycline  is  contraindicated in  the  second  and  third  trimesters  of  pregnancy,  and  both  the Centers  for  Disease  Control  (CDC)  and  WHO  recommend azithromycin  {rst. 59,63 If  second-line  treatment  is  used  to  treat urogenital  chlamydia-for  example, erythromycin 500 mg four times a day for 7 days-a test of cure is advised. T opical tetracycline ointment or azithromycin drops could be considered as an adjunct, but  the  evidence  for  this  is  largely  from  trachoma  studies. 31,64 Most importantly, sexual partners need to be treated to reduce the risk of re-infection in addition to preventing the sequelae of untreated genital chlamydial infection.
WHO {rst-line  therapy  for  NIC  is  now  oral  azithromycin 20 mg/kg/day orally, one dose daily for 3 days, in preference to erythromycin 50 mg/kg/day orally in four divided doses daily for 14 days. 63  The CDC and American Academy of Ophthalmology recommend erythromycin base or ethyl succinate 50 mg/kg/day orally divided into four doses daily for 14 days, with azithromycin as an alternative regimen. 59,60 A possible association between oral erythromycin and infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) has been reported, and it may also be less effective. 65

Prevention and Control
Annual screening of all sexually active women aged < 25 years is recommended in the United States, as is screening of older women at increased risk for infection. 59 This has led to a reduction in the prevalence  of  chlamydial  infection,  including  AIC  and  other extra-genital complications. Other measures, including consistent condom  use,  presumptive  treatment  of  sexual  partners,  and abstinence  from  sex  until  treatment  is  completed,  can  further reduce incidence of disease.
The most effective prevention method in reducing NIC is the screening and treatment of pregnant women. Chlamydia screening in the United States is recommended at the {rst prenatal visit for all pregnant women, and repeat screening during the third trimester is recommended for women aged < 25 years or those at increased risk. 59,66,67 The prevalence of NIC is lower in areas where routine screening and treatment of chlamydial infection in pregnant women occur, and where effective C. trachomatis screening programs are in  place  the  incidence  has  dropped  dramatically. 68 The  risk  of re-infection or new infection in the third trimester has been shown
to  be  as  high  as  13%  in  some settings,  further  supporting  this screening and re-screening policy. 42 A test of cure is recommended for the mother 3 to 4 weeks after treatment to ensure eradication. Erythromycin eye ointment has previously been recommended as  a  prophylactic  agent  to  prevent  neonatal  conjunctivitis. 60 However, there is no evidence that prophylactic treatment should be given to infants born to mothers with untreated chlamydial infection, and there is also no evidence that infants with chlamydial infections  should  be  isolated (standard  hygiene  precautions  are recommended). 59
