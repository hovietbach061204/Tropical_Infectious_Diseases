INTRODUCTION
Subcutaneous mycoses are chronic fungal infections resulting from the percutaneous inoculation of agents  from an exogenous source. The  primary  site  of  multiplication  is  the  dermis  or  subcutis  and although lesions generally remain localized to the site of inoculation, there  is  slow  and  inexorable  spread  to  surrounding  tissue.  Lesions usually  do  not  undergo  spontaneous remission  and,  if  unchecked, tissue destruction can be severe. Dissemination is rare.

============================================================

============================================================
Key features
- Caused by either fungi (eumycetoma) or 'lamentous bacteria (actinomycetoma)
- Mainly seen in dry tropics
- Present with draining sinuses
- Discharge of one or more grains from lesions is key to the diagnosis
- Actinomycetomas usually respond to antibiotics but eumycetomas are seldom curable with antifungals alone

INTRODUCTION
Mycetoma is a chronic, localized,  slowly progressive, subcutaneous infection caused by species of actinomycetes or fungi [1]. It is characterized by destructive granulomatous and suppurative responses, and by draining sinus tracts that can communicate with each other and with the skin surface. In affected tissues, filaments of the causal agents form compact grains or granules.
Mycetoma has multiple etiologies, with more than 20 species of fungi or bacteria implicated. About 60% of infections are caused by actinomycetes (actinomycetoma) and 40% by filamentous fungi (eumycetoma) (Table 78-1). It is important to know whether the cause is a fungus or bacterium in order to determine the correct therapy.

============================================================
CHUNK 3
============================================================
EPIDEMIOLOGY
Mycetoma is endemic in many tropical countries and is most commonly reported from Africa, Central and South America, India, and the  Far  East.  It  occurs  in  regions  with  a  short  rainy  season  of  4-6 months,  daily  temperature  range  of  30-37°C,  and  a  humidity  of 60-80%, alternating with a dry season.
Areas of endemicity are characterized by savannah or forest and the presence of thorny trees or bushes, such as Acacia scrub. Many of the agents causing mycetoma have been isolated from soil, local plants, or trees. Patients are often field laborers or herdsmen whose occupation exposes them to minor penetrating injuries.

============================================================
CHUNK 4
============================================================
NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
Infection is initiated by traumatic implantation, often by the piercing of skin or mucosal surfaces with thorns or wood splinters [2]. Once introduced subcutaneously, the agent begins to grow, eliciting a suppurative inflammatory response that is predominantly neutrophilic but  can  be  accompanied  by  a  granulomatous  reaction.  The  agent appears  in  infected  tissues  as  compact  grains  or  granules  up  to  5 milimeters in diameter whose microscopic appearance may be diagnostic of the infecting species. A key feature is the formation of sinuses and fistulae that interconnect and erupt onto the skin surface.

============================================================
CHUNK 5
============================================================
CLINICAL FEATURES
The initial lesion, which appears several months after the traumatic incident, is a small, firm, painless subcutaneous nodule or plaque that progressively  increases  in  size.  The  evolution  of  eumycetoma  and actinomycetoma can differ. Lesions of eumycetoma are firm, remain localized and progress slowly. Skin papules or nodules form pustular lesions discharging sanguinous or purulent exudates. As it progresses, there is deformity and the production of draining sinus tracts through which  fungal  grains  are  expelled  (Fig.  78.1).  In  actinomycetoma, progression  is  often  rapid.  Lesions  have  less  well-defined  margins, sinus  tracts  are  prominent  and  involvement  of  bone  is  earlier  and more extensive than in eumycetomas.
Most mycetomas are painless, even when well established. Mycetoma can  result  in  loss  of  function  of  an  infected  limb  and  consequent inability to work as the condition does not spontaneously remit. The foot is the most common site involved with about 70% of infections affecting the lower limbs. Other sites include the buttocks and perineum, hands, back, and scalp.

DIAGNOSIS
Grains produced by different agents may be distinctive enough for the diagnosis  to  be  made  by  examination  of  hematoxylin  and  eosinstained tissue sections (Fig. 78.2). Fungal grains have a coarser texture and may be pigmented, consisting of a dense mass of interwoven filaments (hyphae) 2-5 μ m in diameter. Actinomycete grains are more

============================================================
CHUNK 13
============================================================
DIRECT EXAMINATION
Exudates should be examined for the presence of grains. Opening a surface pustule over a sinus tract with a sterile needle may reveal them.
Differentiation of fungal and actinomycete grains is readily achieved by  crushing  the  grain  between  two  glass  slides  and  examining  it microscopically with 10% potassium hydroxide.

INTRODUCTION
Sporotrichosis is a chronic fungal infection principally affecting the skin, lymphatics, and subcutaneous tissues. Pulmonary and disseminated forms, with involvement of the lungs, osteoarticular and musculoskeletal tissues, viscera, mucous membranes, and central nervous system (CNS), are uncommon. Sporotrichosis is caused by a single species, Sporothrix schenckii, which is widely distributed as a soil saprophyte. It is  dimorphic,  existing as  a  mold  in nature  and a  yeast  in infected tissue.

============================================================
CHUNK 18
============================================================
EPIDEMIOLOGY
Sporotrichosis occurs worldwide but is most common in warm, temperate  or  tropical  countries,  and  has  typically  been  reported  from Central and South America, Africa, and Australasia [5]. Most cases are sporadic,  but  epidemics  can  occur  in  hyperendemic  areas.  A  large outbreak that occurred in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, was attributed to spread from infected cats [6]. The disease affects individuals whose occupation brings them into contact with soil, plants, or plant materials, such as straw, wood, or reeds.

============================================================
CHUNK 19
============================================================
NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS AND PATHOLOGY
The  agent  is  rarely  seen  in  histopathologic  material  from  primary infections. When present, it is often pleomorphic, appearing as small, round,  oval  or  cigar-shaped  budding  yeast  cells,  2-3 μ m  wide  by 3-8 μ m long. In some instances, a central fungal cell is surrounded by radiating eosinophilic material (asteroid body).

============================================================
CHUNK 20
============================================================
TREATMENT EUMYCETOMA
Eumycetoma is poorly responsive to chemotherapy; however, a trial of chemotherapy may be justified. Some Madurella mycetomatis infections respond to ketoconazole or itraconazole, and voriconazole is active in some cases [4]. Radical surgical removal is an alternative. In advanced cases of eumycetoma, amputation may be the only way to achieve eradication.

============================================================
CHUNK 21
============================================================
ACTINOMYCETOMA
Medical treatment with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (cotrimoxazole) and streptomycin or rifampin is often effective. Good results have been claimed with a combination of dapsone and streptomycin. Alternatives i nclude amikacin and fusidic acid.

============================================================
CHUNK 22
============================================================
CLINICAL FEATURES
The route of entry is via minor traumatic subcutaneous inoculation. The  incubation  period  varies  from  1-4  weeks  and,  rarely,  up  to  6 months. About 75% of infections affect an upper extremity. There is evidence to suggest that some patients have self-limited infections [7].

============================================================
CHUNK 23
============================================================
CUTANEOUS SPOROTRICHOSIS
The most common form of sporotrichosis is lymphangitic, in which a small,  firm,  movable  subcutaneous  nodule  develops  at  the  site  of inoculation. The nodule later becomes soft and breaks down to form a persistent friable ulcer or chancre. Subsequently, additional nodules develop along the draining lymphatics that progress to ulceration. The presence of a persistent ulcer on a finger or hand and a chain of swollen lymph nodes extending up the arm is suspicious for sporotrichosis. In about a quarter of cutaneous infections, the lesion remains 'fixed', without lymphatic spread. Fixed infections are more common in children and in Latin America. Less commonly, lesions may present as chronic ulcers, mycetoma-like lesions, or well-defined granulomas. Disseminated cutaneous lesions have been reported in patients with AIDS.

============================================================
CHUNK 24
============================================================
PULMONARY SPOROTRICHOSIS
Primary pulmonary infection is rare. It can be asymptomatic but, in individuals with a low level of immunity, it can progress to disseminated disease.

============================================================
CHUNK 25
============================================================
DISSEMINATED SPOROTRICHOSIS
This is uncommon and is generally seen in persons with underlying disease or a predisposition, such as alcoholism [8]. It originates by hematogenous spread, usually from the lung. Sites affected include skin, joints, lungs, bone, mucous membranes, and the CNS.

============================================================
CHUNK 26
============================================================
DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Classic cutaneous lymphatic sporotrichosis is distinct, but the variability of other forms can make diagnosis difficult. Direct examination of  pus  or  skin  is  seldom  helpful  and Sporothrix  schenckii  is usually absent, or rare, in tissue sections. Culture is of the greatest value S. schenckii  is readily  isolated  from  clinical  material  on  a  variety  of culture media.
Sporotrichosis must be distinguished from other mycoses and from infective skin lesions, such as tularemia, leishmaniasis, anthrax, tuberculosis, and pyogenic infection. Lymphatic spread similar to that of
sporotrichosis can occur in Mycobacterium marinum and some South American forms of cutaneous leishmaniasis.

INTRODUCTION
Chromoblastomycosis (chromomycosis) is a chronic mycosis affecting skin and subcutaneous tissues characterized by slow-growing verrucous nodules that coalesce and form hyperkeratotic plaques [9]. It is caused by several species of related fungi; the most common are: Fonsecaea  pedrosoi,  Fonsecaea  compactum,  Phialophora  verrucosa ,  and Cladophialophora carriomi. Irrespective of the species, each has an identical appearance in infected tissues, i.e. single or clustered, rounded or angular, thick-walled and dark-brown bodies ('sclerotic or muriform cells'). Like saprophytes, the organisms are commonly found in soil and wood.

CHUNK 30
============================================================
EPIDEMIOLOGY
Chromoblastomycosis  is  a  tropical  mycosis  diagnosed  more  frequenlty in males than in females and is more prevalent in rural than urban areas.

CHUNK 31
============================================================
NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
The disease follows implantation from the environment and is seen in healthy individuals.

============================================================
CHUNK 32
============================================================
CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
The initial lesion is a warty papule on an exposed site, for example leg or arm, that enlarges slowly to form a verrucous plaque. In some instances, the primary lesion is a pustule, a flat plaque, or an ulcer [10]. As infection progresses, ulceration and serous exudation occur (Fig.  78.3).  Non-painful,  large  hyperkeratotic  plaques  up  to  3 cm thick  with  central  scar  formation  occur.  Super-infection  may  be responsible for lymphostasis and resultant elephantiasis, and secondary-infected lesions have an unpleasant smell.

INTRODUCTION
Rhinosporidiosis  is  a  chronic,  localized  granulomatous  condition that presents with polyp-like lesions. The causative organism has been identified by genetic techniques as a member of the aquatic Protista [1 1]. There are no experimental models and the organism cannot be cultured. Disease has been reported from many tropical countries, but 90% of reported cases are from India and Sri Lanka.
Rhinosporidiosis  is  most  commonly  seen  in  children  and  young adults, and in males more than females (three to one).
The most common site of rhinosporidiosis is the nose (70% of cases), with sessile or pedunculated polyps affecting the nostrils. Lesions can affect the conjunctiva and, rarely, the larynx, genitals, and skin. Dissemination has been reported, but is exceptional.

============================================================
CHUNK 35
============================================================
TREATMENT
No antifungal regimen is universally satisfactory, although itraconazole (200-400 mg/d) and terbinafine (500 mg/d) have been effective. In  extensive lesions, amphotericin B should be given intravenously (Chapter 84) at the outset of treatment; in some cases flucytosine is given in addition. Local application of heat may be effective.

CHUNK 36
============================================================
DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Examination of hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections reveals sporangia of varying sizes and stages of development. Culture serologic tests are not helpful.

INTRODUCTION
Entomophthoromycosis (subcutaneous phycomycosis, subcutaneous zygomycosis)  is  a  localized  mycoses  of  the  nasal  mucosa  and  surrounding tissue. It causes a firm, progressive swelling of subcutaneous tissues. The causal fungus is Basidiobolus haptosporus , a mucormycete. Cases are  usually reported from India  and sub-Saharan Africa. The condition  affects  children  and  adolescents  rather  than  adults,  and boys rather than girls.

CHUNK 40
============================================================
CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
Subcutaneous  swelling  is  firm,  movable  and  well-defined;  satellite lesions may be palpable at the advancing margins [12].
The  overlying  skin  is  usually  intact  and  may  be  tense,  edematous, hyperpigmented  or  normal  in  color. Ulceration occurs but is uncommon, and pain and tenderness are usually absent. Any part of the body may be affected, but the most common sites are the limbs, buttocks, and neck. Regional lymph nodes are rarely affected.

============================================================
CHUNK 41
============================================================
DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Histology shows strands of broad 5-15 μ m thin-walled, branching and generally non-septate hyphae toward the edge of the lesions, each with  an  eosinophilic  sheath  several  micrometers  wide  (SplendoreHoepple phenomenon). It is characterized by eosinophil infiltration and granuloma formation. Cutaneous lymphoma can be similar to subcutaneous  zygomycosis,  but  is  characterized  by  a  more  rapid onset. Other differentials include scleroderma and pretibial myxedema.

============================================================
CHUNK 42
============================================================
TREATMENT
The most effective treatment is itraconazole in doses of 100-200 mg daily. An alternative is oral potassium iodide (KI) in saturated solution in doses up to 10 ml three times daily for 3 months. Amphotericin B has been used in patients refractory to treatment.

INTRODUCTION
Infections caused by Conidiobolus coronatus (rhinoentomophthoromycosis)  lead  to  a  chronic,  localized  subcutaneous  infection  affecting tissues of the nose, cheek, and upper lip [13].

============================================================
CHUNK 44
============================================================
EPIDEMIOLOGY
Conidiobolus coronatus is a mucormycete found in tropical rain forest areas. In contrast to zygomycosis caused by Basidiobolus, rhinoentomophthoromycosis is a disease of young adults, rather than children.
Males are more commonly affected than females. Most infections are reported from West Africa, particularly Nigeria, but cases have been recognized in India and South America.
The mode of infection is unknown, but is probably inoculation of contaminated  soil  or  vegetable  matter  through  minor  trauma  or insect bites.

============================================================
CHUNK 45
============================================================
CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
Infection apparently originates in the nasal mucosa, leading to nasal obstruction, which may be unilateral. Tissue swelling becomes pronounced affecting the nose and nasolabial folds, cheeks, and upper lip,  eventually  producing  gross  facial  distortion  (Fig.  78.5).  The infected areas have distinct margins but the mass is not movable over the underlying tissues. There are few symptoms.

============================================================
CHUNK 46
============================================================
DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The clinical features are distinctive, i.e. localized swelling of the nose and face in tropical countries. Biopsy may be diagnostic when characteristic  hyphae  are  present  and  associated  with  an  eosinophilic sheath and eosinophilic granuloma, as with Basidiobolus infections. Conidiobolus and Basidobolus infections can be differentiated by the site involved.

============================================================
CHUNK 47
============================================================
TREATMENT
Treatment is the same as for Basidiobolus (Chapter 78.5).

INTRODUCTION AND EPIDEMIOLOGY
Phaeohyphomycosis describes infections with dark-pigmented fungi that are clinically and pathologically distinct from chromoblastomycosis or mycetoma and where the organisms are present as irregular hyphae in tissue. The range of causal organisms is wide, embracing some 16 genera and almost 30 species.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND TREATMENT
Lesions are usually solitary and circumscribed, occurring on the feet, legs, hands, and other body sites [14]. Over a period of months or years, the lesions may increase in size, producing a crusted or cystic mass that remains localized. Diagnosis depends on the recognition of brown fungal elements by direct microscopy or in tissue sections, which may be filamentous, irregularly swollen or yeast-like, and by isolation  and identification of  the  agents in  a  specialist laboratory. The treatment for localized forms of the disease is surgical excision.

LOBOMYCOSIS
Lobomycosis or Lobo disease is a chronic, localized mycosis of skin and  subcutaneous  tissues  characterized  by  keloidal  or  verrucoid lesions that contain abundant or lemon-shaped cells. The disease is rare  and  only  recorded  in  remote  and  tropical  areas  of  South  and Central America. It has also been described in freshwater dolphins. The causative organism, Lacazia loboi ,  has not been isolated and its habitat is unknown [15].
Patients  present  with  circumscribed  plaques  or  keloid-like  lesions usually on exposed areas such as the face, ears, or trunk. These may slowly increase in size and plaques can cover wide areas of the body. They are usually asymptomatic. The diagnosis is made by biopsy and histopathology of the lesions. The organisms are present as chains of cells, each with a short, tube-like connection between individual cells.
The best treatment is excision.
