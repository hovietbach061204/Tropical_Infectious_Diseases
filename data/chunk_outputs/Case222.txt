NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS AND PATHOLOGY
- Sparganosis is a rare parasitic disease caused by infestation by the larvae of tapeworms of the genus Spirometra
- It is acquired by ingesting copepods or undercooked meat containing the larvae
- Invasion of tissue by the larvae causes a migratory abscess that is usually subcutaneous, but can appear in any tissue of the body
- CNS infection has the worst prognosis, and presents with seizures, headache, or a slowly evolving paralysis
- The parasite can be distinguished histologically by a head with characteristic deep invagination, body pseudosegmentation, and the absence of suckers and hooks
- De#nitive diagnosis is identi#cation of the worm on extraction, which also can lead to a cure

INTRODUCTION
Sparganosis is a rare parasitic disease of humans caused by invasion of human tissue by plerocercoid tapeworm larvae (spargana) of the genus Spirometra . Many species of Spirometra have been described. In Southeast Asia the parasite is referred to as Spirometra mansoni and in North America as S. mansonoides . On other continents it may be called S. erinacei , S. europaei , S. theileri and S. ranarum [1]. Adult tapeworms occur in domestic and wild carnivores and are similar to Diphyllobothrium (see Chapter 126). The life cycles differ, as Spirometra usually use amphibians, reptiles and mammals as second intermediate hosts, and Diphyllobothrium use fish (Fig. 131.1).

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Humans are rare incidental hosts. The parasites are prevalent in cats, dogs and wild carnivores in many parts of the world, and are endemic in 48 countries. Human infections are most common in Southeast Asia, but infections have been recorded in East Africa, South America, North America, Australia and parts of Europe [2]. The highest endemicity of infection with Spirometra spp. is in Korea and Japan, primarily because of dietary customs [3].
Humans ingest larvae of Spirometra spp. by: 1) drinking contaminated water containing copepods ( Cyclops )  carrying  the procercoid  larvae; 2) ingesting the plerocercoid larvae while eating undercooked meat from second intermediate hosts such as amphibians, reptiles, rodents or other mammals; or 3) using those meats as a poultice (a traditional self-treatment  according  to  ritual  belief)  that  is  applied  directly  to ulcers, sores, or inflamed eyes. The latter is a more common cause of orbital sparganosis [3].
After  ingestion,  the  spargana  migrate  to  the  subcutaneous  tissues, where they become encapsulated in inflammatory nodules that can develop  into  abscesses.  These  abscesses  can  occur  anywhere  in  the body, as spargana have the ability to migrate to any tissue, including the brain [1]. The sparganum remains viable inside the nodule, thus the subcutaneous masses may migrate [4]. The parasite can live for up to 30 years inside their host, and their length can vary from a few millimeters to a few centimeters.

CLINICAL FEATURES
The most common clinical presentation is a migrating subcutaneous abscess that may involve localized pain, erythema and pruritus. Other features of the clinical presentation depend on the location and size of  the lesion  [3]. In the subconjunctival tissues, the larvae provoke acute inflammation with painful conjunctivitis and periorbital edema. If the larvae invade the periorbital tissues, it may result in proptosis and blindness [3]. Sparganosis can infect the central nervous system (CNS),  breast,  lungs,  peritoneal  cavity,  epididymis,  bone,  bladder, heart, ear and kidneys. In some locations, such as breast, bone and peritoneal cavity, it could be mistaken for cancer.
CNS  infections  usually  have  the  worst  prognosis.  Although  CNS involvement  is  rare,  spargana  have  been  reported  to  cause  brain abscesses (that may migrate), intradural spinal canal infection, and extradural spinal cord infection. In these cases, the mass may produce seizures  (reported  as  most  common  symptom),  headache,  slowly evolving  hemiparesis,  paresthesias,  memory  loss,  confusion  and radiculalgia,  depending  on  the  location  [3].  There  is  no  evidence to  suggest  that  immunosuppression  influences  the  risk  of  CNS infection.
On biopsy, the parasites can usually be extracted alive, and they may be several centimeters in  length. They  are  glistening white,  opaque ribbon-like worms with a typical undulating cestode movement (Fig. 131.2A,C). Grossly, the inflammation is nodular and locally fibrotic. Histologically, the inflammation consists of lymphocytes, histiocytes, plasma cells, neutrophils, and multinucleated giant cells; eosinophils may be abundant or absent (Fig. 131.2B).

CLINICAL FEATURES
FIGURE 131.1 Lifecycle of Spirometra spp. Ova from the adult worm are shed in the feces of the de2nitive hosts, cats and dogs. The eggs hatch in fresh water into coracidia, which are ingested by the 2rst intermediate host, copepods of the genus Cyclops, and grow into the 2rst larval stage, procercoid. Water containing the copepods is ingested by the second intermediate hosts, which include reptiles, amphibians and mammals, where they grow into the plerocercoid larvae. Sparganum develops into an adult worm in the intestines of the de2nitive hosts.

PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
In a patient with a subcutaneous infection suspected to be sparganosis,  peripheral  eosinophilia  does  not  occur,  and  blood  work  will provide  little  help.  However,  peripheral  eosinophilia  can  be  pronounced  in  CNS  infection.  Enzyme-linked  immunosorbent  assay (ELISA) has shown high sensitivity and specificity, but is only available in a research setting [5].
Imaging can be helpful in some cases, especially in CNS infection. Ultrasonographic  findings  in  subcutaneous  and  musculoskeletal cases include serpiginous, cystic, tubular tracts with an echogenicity. These are not specific to sparganosis [6].
In CNS infection, computed tomography (CT) scan can reveal multifocal areas of low density within white matter, adjacent ventricular dilation, or irregular enhancing lesions. The most distinct features of sparganosis on CT scan are the small punctuate calcifications caused by the calcareous corpuscles the worm leaves in its tract (seen more clearly  on  CT  scan  than  on  magnetic  resonance  imaging  [MRI]) (Fig. 131.3).
Further investigation with MRI in CNS infection has three characteristic  features. The first is the tunnel sign, created by the undulating movement of the worm (Fig. 131.4A-C). It is a column-shaped or fusiform-shaped  tunnel  with  a  hollow  appearance  and  a  smooth, well-defined  margin  [7].  A  second  characteristic  finding  is  ring  or bead-shaped enhancement, representing inflammatory granuloma. A third sign is a change in the location and shape of the lesion on serial images, due to migration [8]. It is important to look for lesions of multiple ages in the same image, due to the long course of the disease.

PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Definitive diagnosis is provided by identification of the parasite in a tissue specimen. If the intact parasite is extracted, it can be recognized by its head with a characteristic deep invagination (Fig. 131.2C,D). Histologic sections of the worm show features of cestode larvae (Fig. 131.2D). The surface tegument has multiple infoldings, or pseudosegmentation. The worm-like appearance and the solid body of the spargana along with the absence of suckers and hooks usually distinguish  them  from  the  cystic  stages  of  other  cestodes  that  occur  in subcutaneous tissues. Within the body of the worm, there are longitudinal muscle fibers, excretory channels  and  calcareous corpuscles (Fig. 131.3) [9].
Differential diagnosis of parasite-induced  cerebral mass  lesions includes Toxoplasma ,  infection  with  various  larval  forms  of  other cestodes such as Coenurus , Echinococcus , Multiceps ,  cysticercosis,  and paragonimiasis, and can be distinguished microscopically. Gnathostomiasis,  paragonimiasis  and  infection  from  the  filarial  nematode Loa loa can each cause migratory subcutaneous masses.

TREATMENT
The only effective treatment is complete surgical removal of the intact worm and the surrounding granuloma. In patients with many infections, supplementary treatment with praziquantel may be advisable, but  there  is  little  evidence  to  suggest  its  effectiveness  (see  Chapter 128). ELISA after removal can help to determine whether the worm was removed completely.

In endemic areas, the local population should be discouraged from drinking 'raw' water from natural ponds. The use of frog poultices should be discouraged.

SPARGANUM PROLI FE RUM
This is a rare aberrant species of cestode found in the skin, muscles, viscera and brain of humans. These larvae are cylindrical or slightly flattened  and  can  be  20 cm  long  and  2 mm  wide;  they  are  distinguished by the ability to bud and branch. They have been reported only in the Far East and the Americas. Surgery is ineffective treatment for this disease due to its proliferative nature. So far, there is no effective treatment.
FIGURE 131.4 Tunnel sign. Post-contrast axial (A) , coronal (B) and sagittal (C) weighted images show a tunnel about 5 cm in length and 1.5 cm in width, appearing as a hollow tube located in the left temporal and parietal lobe. Tunnel sign is usually seen most easily on coronal and sagittal images.
