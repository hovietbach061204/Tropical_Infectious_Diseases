INTRODUCTION
Poxviruses  belong  to  the  family  Poxviridae.  Those  that  infect humans are found among four genera ( Orthopoxvirus, Parapoxvirus, Molluscipoxvirus, and Yatapoxvirus )  within the Chordopoxvirinae subfamily (T able 32.2.1). Most poxvirus infections in humans are zoonoses, with only variola and molluscum contagiosum viruses being uniquely human pathogens. Poxviruses are large, generally brick-shaped  virions  containing  double-stranded  DNA  that,  in contrast to many other DNA viruses, replicate within the cytoplasm rather than in the nucleus of the host cell. 1
Variola virus is the etiologic agent of smallpox and was responsible for millions of deaths over thousands of years. The earliest archeological evidence dates to the 18th dynasty in ancient Egypt (1580-1350 BC). Large epidemics of smallpox occurred in most civilizations, with 10% to 30% of cases resulting in death. Smallpox was  eradicated  through  an  intensive global  campaign  based on vaccination with vaccinia virus, a related Orthopoxvirus thought to be derived from cowpox virus. Recent genetic analysis of vaccine virus  from  the  early 20th century suggests an ancestral lineage linked  to  horsepox  virus. 2 The  last  endemic  case  of  smallpox occurred  in  Somalia  in  1977,  and  in  1980  the  World  Health 3
More recently, concern has been raised about the use of variola virus  as  a  biological  weapon,  resulting  in  increased  interest  in poxviruses. With more frequent global travel and the expansion of human populations into new habitats, the public health importance of zoonotic poxviruses and their potential to cause outbreaks

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Monkeypox virus was {rst identi{ed in captive monkeys at the State Serum Institute in Copenhagen in 1958, although they are not  the  natural  viral  reservoir.  Monkeypox  virus  is  endemic  to tropical rainforests of central and western Africa, with most human cases occurring in the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly in  neighboring  Republic of  Congo, 4 and  a  cluster  of  cases  was reported in 2005 to 2006 in Sudan for the {rst time. 5 T oward the end of 2017 an outbreak of monkeypox in Nigeria caused a reported 269 suspected and 115 con{rmed cases scattered throughout the country. 6 In 2003 the {rst report of human monkeypox outside of the African continent occurred in the midwestern United States and was associated with imported African rodents. 7
are engaged in hunting and gathering. 8 Humans contract monkeypox through direct contact with infected animals or humans. Most cases are contracted through direct contact with infected body |uids or lesions during hunting, skinning, killing, or cooking animal carcasses.  Such  mammals include the  great apes  (chimpanzees and orangutans), many species of monkey, domestic pigs, African hedgehogs, opossums, many species of squirrel, dormice, African porcupines, rats, jerboa, and shrews. The natural reservoir species is unknown; however, rope squirrels or other terrestrial rodents that inhabit the forests of central and western Africa are considered the most likely viral reservoirs. 8,9

EPIDEMIOLOGY
The {rst documented human case of monkeypox was a child in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1970, 2 years after the last case of smallpox had occurred in the area. 10 After subsequent Democratic  Republic  of  Congo  between  1981  and  1986  and identi{ed a further 338 cases, with 28% attributed to secondary human-to-human transmission. The largest reported outbreak of Republic of Congo during 1996 and 1997, although confusion with a  concurrent varicella outbreak  made  precise estimates of the size of the outbreak dif{cult. 11 With increased global travel and interest in exotic pets, the geographic range of monkeypox has expanded. In 2003 the {rst outbreak of monkeypox outside of Africa occurred in the midwestern United States, with 71 cases, of which 35 were laboratory-con{rmed. 12 Many cases had direct contact with infected pet prairie dogs. The outbreak was traced to imported giant Gambian rats from Ghana that were housed with prairie dogs. Despite this importation and the potential for monkeypox virus to infect a broad range of mammals, the virus does not appear to have established an endemic animal reservoir within the United States. 8,13
Person-to-person transmission of monkeypox virus accounts for 10% to 30% of cases. 11 T ransmission is through large respiratory droplets during prolonged face-to-face contact, although transmission through  contact  with  infected  fomites  or  aerosols  may  occur. 8 Person-to-person transmission of monkeypox virus is less ef{cient than for variola virus, and the longest recorded human chain of transmission is six generations. 4 Studies conducted in the 1980s suggested that household transmission from an index case occurred in  8%  to  15%  of  contacts. 14 These  data  were  used  to  create  a stochastic model for the spread of monkeypox between humans, which indicated that monkeypox virus was highly unlikely to sustain itself in human populations and therefore did not constitute a major public health problem. 15 When these studies were conducted, most household  members  were  vaccinated  against  smallpox,  which provided cross-protective immunity to monkeypox infection. T oday, most  individuals  are  now  unvaccinated.  In  an  outbreak  in  the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2013, the proportion of household contacts infected with monkeypox ranged from 50% to 100%, 16 suggesting an increased risk for human-to-human transmission.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
In  endemic regions,  transmission of  human  monkeypox has been reported throughout the year with no peak month or season. Incidence is highest in individuals under the age of 15 years and is slightly higher in males than females in this age group. In 1981 serologic surveys were carried out in four countries in central and western  Africa  to  determine  the  prevalence  of Orthopoxvirus infection, including monkeypox virus infection. 17 The prevalence of antibodies to Orthopoxvirus was 15.4% among people without were seropositive for monkeypox virus, with seroprevalence highest among children aged 5 to 9 years. More recently, a study conducted in the Republic of Congo after an outbreak of monkeypox in 2003 found  a  seroprevalence  of  57%  for Orthopoxvirus ,  with  some seropositivity likely attributable to prior smallpox vaccination. 18 A 20-fold increase in the incidence of monkeypox was found in the Democratic Republic of Congo by active surveillance 30 years after cessation of smallpox, and unvaccinated individuals were at a 5.2-fold increased risk of monkeypox. 19

The age distribution of cases and the secondary attack rate for monkeypox  have  changed,  most  likely  because  of  cessation  of smallpox  vaccination  and  waning  immunity  among  vaccinated persons.  In  the  1970s  and  1980s,  most  cases  occurred  among unvaccinated  children  younger  than  5  years  of  age.  Secondary cases tended to be older and were likely to be among mothers of infected children. As susceptibility to monkeypox increased, both the  average  age  of  infection  and  the  proportion  of  secondary infections increased (T able 32.2.2). In the Democratic Republic of Congo, the mean age of cases of monkeypox increased from 4.4 years during the period 1981 to 1986 to 15.4 years during the period 2001 to 2004. 20

Molluscum contagiosum is  the  most  common  poxvirus  infection  of  humans  and  causes umbilicated papules of 1 to 5 mm in size on the face, trunk, or Parapoxvirus infection of humans, is a zoonotic infection acquired from goats and sheep manifesting as papules, nodules, and pustules at the site of inoculation. T anapox virus, in the genus Yatapoxvirus and  endemic  in  equatorial Africa,  is  transmitted  by  nonhuman primates  via  an  arthropod  vector  or  by  direct  contact,  and results  in  a  febrile  illness  with  papulonodular  skin  lesions  and lymphadenopathy.

============================================================
CHUNK 12
============================================================
NATURAL HISTORY AND PATHOGENESIS
Monkeypox  begins  with  infection  of  either  the  dermis  (after transmission from infected animals) or the respiratory epithelium (after transmission from an infected person). The virus disseminates through the lymphatic system, resulting in primary viremia and systemic infection. A secondary viremia results in infection of the epithelium, producing skin and mucosal lesions. As a consequence of  replication  in  mucosal  surfaces  the  virus  can  be  transmitted through oropharyngeal secretions to close contacts. The risk of transmission likely depends on the density of oropharyngeal lesions, the proximity and duration of contact, and virus survival, despite host immune responses. Monkeypox virus, like other poxviruses, has evolved mechanisms to evade host immune responses. Monkeypox virus is likely to be stable on fomites, and the number of virions required for infection is thought to be low based on potential similarities  with  variola  virus.  Strain  differences  may  existmonkeypox strains circulating in western Africa appear to be more attenuated and less transmissible than those in the Congo basin. 21
The incubation period from exposure to the onset of clinical symptoms and signs is 10 to 14 days. Patients are infectious during the {rst week of rash and should be isolated. 13 Most people infected with monkeypox virus are symptomatic, but sub-clinical infection can  occur.  Serologic  studies  of  household  contacts  of  acutely infected cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo suggest that approximately 28% of all monkeypox infections are sub-clinical. More recently, immunologic evidence of exposure to monkeypox virus was identi{ed in several asymptomatic contacts of infected people in the United States. 22,23
HIV and other conditions that suppress cell-mediated immunity may alter the natural history of disease. No data exist for monkeypox,  but  other  poxvirus  infections,  speci{cally  vaccinia  and molluscum contagiosum viruses, are more severe in those  who are infected with HIV.

post-auricular,  axillary,  or  inguinal  lymphadenopathy  occurs  in many infected  persons  1  to  2  days  before  rash  onset.  Lymphadenopathy is not a typical feature of smallpox and can serve to clinically distinguish monkeypox from smallpox (Fig. 32.2.2; see Table 32.2.3). As with smallpox, lesions develop concurrently and progress at a  similar  rate  over  2  to 4  weeks,  depending  on  the disease  severity. The  rash  begins  as  small,  2-  to  5-mm  papules and progresses through vesicular, pustular, and crusted stages over 2  to  3  weeks  (Fig.  32.2.3).

PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Poxvirus infection should be considered when evaluating a patient with a febrile illness and vesiculopustular rash, particularly when the patient resides in an area endemic for monkeypox virus (see Fig. 32.2.1) or has contact with animals capable of transmitting poxviruses. A presumptive diagnosis of monkeypox can often be made  clinically  based  on  the  characteristic  rash  and  lymphadenopathy, although the skin lesions may be dif{cult to distinguish from chickenpox early in the course of illness (see T able 32.2.3). Smallpox should be considered if bioterrorism is possible. Suspected cases of monkeypox should be reported to local health authorities.
Laboratory  diagnosis  is  necessary  to  con{rm  the  diagnosis of  monkeypox  and  differentiate  infection  from  other  causes of  vesiculopustular  rash.  The  case  de{nition  developed  by  the Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  (CDC)  after  the 2003  outbreak  in  the  United  States  is  shown  in  T able  32.2.4. or  swabs  of  the  base  of  vesicles  applied  to  a  microscope  slide and air dried.

EXCLUSION CRITERIA
With the exception of smallpox, monkeypox is most commonly confused clinically with varicella (chickenpox) (see T able 32.2.3), and coinfection with both  viruses  can  occur. 25 Varicella  can  be distinguished from monkeypox because the skin lesions of chickenpox are pleomorphic (in different stages of development), are concentrated on the trunk, and rarely involve the palms and soles. Lymphadenopathy does not occur in uncomplicated varicella, and rash  include  drug  eruptions,  eczema  herpeticum,  dermatitis herpetiformis, rickettsialpox, and molluscum contagiosum. 11

PREVENTION AND TREATMENT
Access to basic health care in remote forested areas of western and central sub-Saharan Africa can be dif{cult, and the prevention and treatment of monkeypox are severely limited in the absence of  external  assistance.  Data  from  the  Democratic  Republic  of Congo in the early 1980s suggested that pre-exposure smallpox vaccination  provided  approximately  85%  protection  against monkeypox. 26 Prior smallpox vaccination, however, did not provide complete protection against monkeypox in the United States. 22 No  information  is  available  on  the  ef{cacy  of  post-exposure vaccination with vaccinia virus, although extrapolation from postexposure  vaccination  for  the  prevention  of  smallpox  suggests post-exposure  vaccination  may  prevent  monkeypox  disease  or reduce  severity  if  given  within  3  days  of  exposure.  The  CDC currently recommends routine smallpox vaccination of laboratory personnel who directly handle cultures or animals contaminated or infected with replication-competent Orthopoxviruses . The CDC also  recommends that vaccination  be offered  to  health  care  or animal  care  personnel  who  have  contact  with  contaminated materials, provided they have no contraindications to vaccination. Post-exposure vaccination for those with an Orthopoxvirus exposure can be determined on a case-by-case basis in consultation with public health authorities. 27
Treatment of persons with monkeypox is supportive. Data are not available on the effectiveness of vaccinia immune globulin for the  prevention  or  treatment  of  complications  of  monkeypox; however, the CDC recommends immune globulin be considered for prophylactic use in persons exposed to monkeypox virus with severe cellular immunode{ciency for whom smallpox vaccination is contraindicated. 28 Cidofovir and brincidofocir (CMX001) have anti-monkeypox viral activity in vitro and in animal studies, with brincidofocir  exhibiting  greater  potency  and  safety. 29 Whether humans may bene{t from either treatment is not known, but the CDC recommends that treatment with either antiviral be considered in  persons  with  severe  monkeypox. 28 T ecovirimat  (ST-246)  has also been shown to be effective in treating Orthopoxvirus -induced disease  in  animal  studies, 30 but  would  need  to  be  administered under an Investigational New Drug status. 28
