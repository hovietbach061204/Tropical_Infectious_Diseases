KEY FEATURES
- Streptococcus or Streptococcus pyogenes is the predominant cause of bacterial pharyngitis, and skin infection globally.
- Streptococcus is also a cause of severe invasive, necrotizing, and toxin-mediated syndromes and debilitating non-suppurative sequelae, including rheumatic fever and acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.
- over 639,000 deaths annually, the majority in developing countries, caused by invasive infection or from rheumatic heart disease and its complications.
- Streptococcus is universally sensitive to penicillin, which remains the mainstay of treatment and for the prevention of rheumatic heart disease.

INTRODUCTION
Group A Streptococcus (GAS) causes a diverse spectrum of disease, ranging from benign and self-limited infections of the throat or skin, to lethal soft tissue infections accompanied by multi-organ failure. Until the advent of the antibiotic era, GAS was a major cause of death in industrialized countries due to fatal epidemics of scarlet fever, sepsis, and rheumatic heart disease (RHD). The 1980s  saw  an  increase  in  rheumatic  fever  cases  in  the  Rocky Mountain  states  of  the  United  States,  along  with  an  apparent resurgence in severe GAS disease in industrialized countries. 1 The subsequent  awareness  of  GAS  disease  in  recent  years  has  also brought to focus its disproportionately high burden in resourcelimited settings, especially in tropical regions. The severe implications of advanced RHD and the existence of effective strategies for prevention and treatment highlight the need for better data to accurately determine worldwide burden. 2,3

EPIDEMIOLOGY
As expected, the burden of all GAS infections is highest in resourcelimited  settings.  This  is  likely  related  to  poverty,  overcrowded living conditions, and reduced access to medical care, although geography and climate may also play a role. The estimated number of  cases  and  deaths  from  GAS  diseases  are  summarized  in Table 40.1. Of these, 79% of RHD cases, 95% of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) cases, 97% of acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis  (APSGN)  cases,  and  97%  of  invasive  GAS  cases  come from less developed countries. 2
Pharyngitis is the most common manifestation of GAS disease; the peak incidence is in school-aged children. Compared with the incidence in developed urban settings, which may be as low as one episode per 8 child years, the incidence in resource-limited settings may be four to eight times higher. 2 GAS colonization has been detected in the oropharynx of approximately one in eight school-aged children; lower rates occur below the age of 5 years ( ≈ 5%), with groups C and G streptococci being more common.

Approximately  one-third  of  school-aged  children  who  present with a sore throat will have GAS as the causative organism; this declines to < 15% in adulthood. In temperate climates, there is signi{cant  seasonal  variation  in  the  rates  of  GAS  pharyngitis, peaking during winter/early spring. In tropical climates, the seasonal variation  appears  to  be  less  marked,  although  robust  data  are lacking. 4 It is unclear as to whether other factors affect this (e.g., increased viral transmission or crowding). 5 Impetigo is common in childhood; transmission occurs readily in school and pre-school care  settings,  especially  during  summer  in  humid  locations.  In tropical settings where the burden is particularly high, almost half of children can have impetigo at any one time. 6
Outbreaks  of  scarlet  fever  occur  sporadically  even  in  the industrialized world, although they are much less common since the advent of antibiotics. In 2011 Hong Kong had an incidence 10  times  the  baseline  rate;  similarly,  an  epidemic  in  northwest London occurred in 2014 with an incidence three to six times higher than average. 7
Cellulitis and erysipelas are the most common manifestations of invasive GAS infection. Cellulitis is associated with increasing temperatures in temperate climates. The increased humidity of the tropics  also  contributes  to  an  increased  rate  of  cellulitis  in these areas. Unlike pharyngitis and impetigo, incidence of cellulitis increases with age. Erysipelas does not appear to have a predilection to changes in climate and has a bi-modal incidence affecting the young and the elderly. In the mid-1980s, reports emerged from industrialized  countries  of  both  increasing  numbers  of  severe necrotizing  GAS  infections  and  of  streptococcal  toxic  shock syndrome (STSS) affecting otherwise healthy individuals. GAS strains belonging to emm types-1, 3, 12, and 18 in particular-have been implicated. 1 Severe  invasive  GAS  infections  mostly  occur sporadically,  but  secondary  cases  and  case  clusters  have  been reported. 8 In industrialized countries, the case mortality for severe GAS infection ranges from 10% in younger patients to 20% in the elderly. Limited data suggest a higher mortality in resourcelimited settings.

ARF  is  uncommon  in  industrialized  settings,  although  the incidence remains high among Indigenous populations in Australia, New Zealand, and the Paci{c. The largest burden of disease is thought  to  exist  in  India,  China,  Pakistan,  Indonesia,  and  the Democratic Republic of Congo; together these {ve countries are estimated  to  account  for  73%  of  the  global  burden. 9 Seasonal variation in the incidence of ARF mimics the variation seen with GAS pharyngitis. Estimates of global burden are given in T able 40.1, although the true prevalence of ARF/RHD remains uncertain, due to the accuracy of diagnosis and lack of widespread screening programs.
ARF and RHD continue to result in the major component of GAS-related morbidity and mortality in resource-limited settings. RHD is estimated to affect more than 33 million people worldwide. 9 RHD and its associated complications (e.g., infective endocarditis, stroke) are thought to be responsible for two-thirds of the estimated 639,000  GAS-related  deaths  each  year.  The  ability  to  identify clinically silent (subclinical) carditis with echocardiography in ARF has  resulted  in  signi{cant  increase  in  detection  in  some  areas, rates up to 10 times higher than those using auscultation alone. 10
The incidence of APSGN appears to be declining in industrialized settings. APSGN continues to occur both sporadically and in epidemics in tropical climates where pyoderma rates are also high. Seasonal variation is similar to pyoderma, peaking in hot,

NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
The oropharynx and the skin of humans are the only recognized ecologic niches for GAS, and they represent the major entry sites for both local and invasive infection (Fig. 40.1). 12 Surface proteins
facilitate speci{c adhesion of GAS to either the mucosal epithelium of the throat or skin. Asymptomatic colonization of the oropharynx may persist at low levels for weeks without eliciting a host immune response.  Colonization  of  the  skin  is  more  transient,  usually becoming established only days before inoculation (e.g., by insect bite)  and  subsequent  pyoderma.  Poor  food  hygiene  has  been responsible  for  several  outbreaks  of  GAS  pharyngitis  in  both low-resource settings and industrialized areas. 12
Pharyngitis and pyoderma are mostly benign with spontaneous resolution  usually  within  days.  Invasion  by  GAS  into  normally sterile  sites  occurs  less  commonly,  but  when this  occurs  it may result  in  severe  clinical  manifestations  arising  from  complex host-pathogen interactions. Viral infection, notably with measles, varicella, or in|uenza, is occasionally antecedent to invasive infection. The  skin  and  throat  are  the  main  portals  for  entry,  after which GAS evades host defenses by expressing a number of virulence factors,  chief  of  which  is  M  protein,  which  extends  as  hairlike {laments from the cell surface. T ogether with the hyaluronic acid capsule  and  other  surface  proteins,  M  protein  enables  GAS  to evade phagocytosis by multiple mechanisms, including preventing opsonization  by  blocking  complement  {xation  to  the  bacterial cell wall. 12
Several additional cellular products appear to facilitate direct spread of the invading organism through tissue planes, potentially leading to bacteremia and hematogenous dissemination. Certain high-virulence strains of GAS secrete 'super-antigens' which are able  to  stimulate  T  lymphocytes  and  antigen-presenting  cells simultaneously, leading to overwhelming cytokine production and resultant shock seen in STSS. 12,13

============================================================
NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
Antibodies against GAS proteins are important in providing protection against subsequent infection, in particular, those targeting serotype-speci{c epitopes on the M protein. However, aberrant immune responses to otherwise benign GAS infection of the throat or skin can result in the immune-mediated manifestations: ARF, RHD, and APSGN. In ARF, cross-reactive antibodies are thought to  arise  in  genetically  predisposed  individuals  infected  with rheumatogenic GAS strains. These immune-mediated responses affect the endocardial, synovial, and neural tissue resulting in the syndrome of ARF. 12 Recent genome-wide association studies have identi{ed  an  association  between  RHD  and  polymorphisms of the gene encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain, speci{cally the  IGHV4-61  segment  in  certain  populations. 14 Impetigo  is suspected to cause ARF, although this has not been proven. Case reports exist to support the possible link between a patient with GAS  impetigo  and  concurrent  group  C Streptococcus (GCS) pharyngitis  suffering  from  ARF. 15 Further  work  is  required  to clarify a de{nitive link between impetigo and ARF, as well as the association between group C/G Streptococcus and ARF, as has been noted for APSGN.

CLINICAL FEATURES
GAS pharyngitis may be mild or associated with high fever, tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, tonsillar exudates, and raised peripheral white cell count. Symptoms usually resolve after 3 to 5 days, although suppurative complications include peritonsillar and retropharyngeal abscess (which are now less common in industrialized settings), suppurative lymphadenitis, otitis media, mastoiditis, and meningitis. Non-suppurative complications include scarlet fever, ARF, or  APSGN. Scarlet fever is characterized by a diffuse blanching rash that spreads from the chest to the abdomen and extremities, leaving a sandpaper-like texture to the skin. Desquamation of the {ngers, toes, groin, and axilla occurs one or more weeks later. The tongue is frequently coated in a white {lm (white strawberry tongue) that eventually gives way to a beefy red appearance (red strawberry tongue). Although most cases are benign, scarlet fever was often lethal in the pre-antibiotic era. Many cases likely represented what would be regarded today as STSS.
In simple impetigo, infection is con{ned to the epidermis with the formation of super{cial crusted lesions on the face or other exposed body parts. Especially in tropical and impoverished settings, 'pyodermatous' lesions may be pustular and ulcerative, with deeper ulceration leading to ecthyma. Children are usually afebrile and otherwise well, although resolution of pyoderma may take many days and result in scarring. Erysipelas, which typically affects the face or an extremity, is a painful infection of the dermis resulting in a clearly demarcated red and raised area of in|ammation and sometimes  super{cial  bullae  formation.  Cellulitis  involves  the deeper subcutaneous tissues, causing a more diffuse and less clearly demarcated area of in|ammation. Lymphangitis, infection of the draining lymphatic ducts, results in tender linear streaks extending proximally from the site of infection. Unlike impetigo, GAS cellulitis and  erysipelas  are  often  associated  with  fever  and  systemic toxicity.

CHUNK 11
============================================================
CLINICAL FEATURES
Necrotizing fasciitis is a rapidly progressing infection of the subcutaneous  fat,  the  super{cial  fascia,  and  deeper  structures, including muscle. Shock, multi-organ failure, and death may ensue within hours or days of onset. Initially, the overlying skin is relatively spared,  and  severe  escalating  pain  may  be  disproportionate  to clinical {ndings. The skin subsequently becomes violaceous, there may  be  bullae  formation  and  associated  sloughing.  STSS  is characteristically associated with GAS necrotizing fasciitis, although it may arise in the setting of other invasive GAS infections. The case de{nition of STSS requires the con{rmation of GAS infection, along with hypotension and two or more features of multi-organ involvement: rash,  coagulopathy,  acute respiratory  distress syndrome, renal failure, or hepatic impairment. 16

============================================================
CHUNK 12
============================================================
CLINICAL FEATURES
Otitis media, retropharyngeal and peritonsillar abscess, sinusitis, meningitis,  pneumonia,  bacteremia,  necrotizing  fasciitis,  and endocarditis  may  arise  without  apparent  antecedent  or  as  a complication of tonsillopharyngitis, surgery or trauma (including burns),  or  varicella  infection.  Historically,  outbreaks  of  GAS pneumonia were reported among previously healthy adults, although more recent reports have described the highest risk among the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions; infection in these individuals is often associated with high case fatality. A viral prodrome is often reported, although the onset of fever, chest pain, and dyspnea is characteristically rapid. GAS pneumonia may be necrotizing with pleural effusions frequently present early. Other complications include lung abscess formation, mediastinitis, and pericarditis. GAS uncommonly causes meningitis; most reports involve  individuals  with  a  pre-existing  focus  of  GAS  infection (e.g.,  pharyngitis,  otitis  media)  or  with  other  risk  factors  (e.g., skull defect or post-cranial surgery). 17 Puerperal sepsis caused by GAS was a frequent cause of death in the pre-antibiotic era with outbreaks resulting from nosocomial transmission. Unlike group B Streptococcus, GAS more commonly affects the mother than the infant, manifesting as post-partum endometritis, peritonitis, septic thrombophlebitis, or bacteremia without focus. 18 Chorioamnionitis, septic abortion, and neonatal  sepsis  have also been reported. A study in four tropical developing countries (Papua New Guinea, Ethiopia, the Gambia, and the Philippines) during the 1990s found that GAS was one of the three leading causes of bacteremia in newborns < 90  days  old,  suggesting  that  peripartum  infections remain common. 19 Similarly, GAS was the third most common cause of bacteremia in neonates (behind Escherichia coli and group B Streptococcus ) in a large prospective, population-based study in Kili{, Kenya. 20

============================================================
CHUNK 13
============================================================
CLINICAL FEATURES
ARF is characterized by various combinations of fever, mono/ poly arthritis or arthralgias, carditis (both clinical and sub-clinical), erythema marginatum, chorea, and subcutaneous nodules. 21 Chorea and insidious carditis can occur as a manifestation of ARF in the absence of other features. The 2015 revision of the Jones criteria now  includes  assessment  by  echocardiography  to  ensure  that subclinical carditis is identi{ed, as it is often not clinically evident. Severe or recurrent episodes of ARF may result in progressive
damage to the mitral valve (most commonly) and/or the aortic valve, resulting in RHD. Over several years, the valve may eventually become stenotic,  resulting  in  subsequent  atrial  {brillation  and right  ventricular failure. Post-streptococcal  reactive  arthritis describes a syndrome of polyarthritis that differs from ARF by affecting  a  range  of  smaller  joints,  being  relatively  resistant  to anti-in|ammatory treatment, and not being associated with carditis, although cases of ARF have been misdiagnosed as post-streptococcal reactive arthritis. 21
APSGN can occur 1 to 2 weeks after throat infection or a few weeks after GAS skin infection. The features are hematuria (usually gross), edema, and hypertension. Severe cases can also be complicated  by  hypertensive  encephalopathy  (posterior  reversible encephalopathy  syndrome).  The  illness  is  generally  benign  in childhood, but there may be an appreciable mortality among adults as a result of renal and congestive cardiac failure.
Pediatric  autoimmune  neuropsychiatric  disorders  associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) is a term used to describe some children with tic or obsessive compulsive disorders in whom symptoms appear to develop or worsen after GAS infection. The existence  of  PANDAS  remains  controversial,  and  studies  have found no de{nitive link with GAS infection. 22

PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Viruses account for most episodes of acute pharyngitis in all age groups. GAS is isolated in only 20% to 40% of cases of exudative pharyngitis in school-aged children and an even lower proportion of cases in younger children and adults. Recovery of the organism may represent colonization rather than infection. The distinguishing features  of  GAS  pharyngitis  and  scarlet  fever,  and  differential diagnoses, are detailed in T able 40.2.
may colonize the oropharynx (e.g., group C and G streptococci), and differentiation is by demonstration of growth inhibition by bacitracin  or  the  use  of  commercially  available  group-speci{c antigen detection kits. Rapid antigen detection tests have been developed to  allow  clinicians  to  reliably  distinguish  GAS  from viral  pharyngitis  at  the  point  of  care  with  good  sensitivity  and speci{city, although this varies by test.
Staphylococcus aureus is  a  major  cause of community-acquired pyogenic  infection  and  an  important  differential  diagnosis  for invasive GAS infection, especially for skin, osteo-articular infections, and necrotizing pneumonia. The features that may help to distinguish GAS from S. aureus and other skin infections are listed in Table  40.2.  In  addition,  a  form  of  toxic  shock  syndrome  may complicate S. aureus infection and shares many features with STSS, with the exception that it is more frequently associated with colonization by S. aureus rather than with invasive infection.
Invasive infections resulting from trauma or bites, exposure to water or soil, or involving immunocompromised hosts (including diabetic foot infections) may be caused by a variety of pathogens and therefore require broader empirical therapy and heightened efforts to obtain a microbiologic diagnosis to target therapy. 23
GAS cellulitis and erysipelas are clinical diagnoses and are only occasionally  con{rmed  by  positive  blood  cultures.  Culture  of percutaneous aspirates is helpful if positive, but is usually negative. The clinical suspicion of necrotizing fasciitis or myonecrosis must be con{rmed promptly by the demonstration of non-viable tissue at surgery. Imaging results are frequently non-de{nitive and may inadvertently delay the diagnosis and institution of appropriate treatment. GAS can usually be cultured from operative specimens, if not from blood, in patients with necrotizing fasciitis.

PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The diagnosis of a primary episode of ARF is based on the most recent 2015 revision of the Jones criteria (T able 40.3), which  includes the use of echocardiography to evaluate for clinically silent carditis. These clinical and  investigational criteria have been repeatedly  revised since the original 1944 version. The criteria now require the risk strati{cation of an individual to either low risk (ARF incidence ≤ 2 per 100,000 school aged children [5-14 years old] per year, or all-age RHD prevalence of ≤ 1 per 1000 population per year) or moderate/ high risk (ARF incidence > 2 per 100,000 school aged children [5-14 years  old]  per  year,  or  all-age  RHD  prevalence > 1 per  1000  population per year). Although not essential for diagnosis, echocardiography is recommended where available, due to the rates of sub-clinical carditis. 21 The RHD diagnostic criteria with echocardiography are highly speci{c and beyond the scope of this chapter.
In APSGN, activation of the alternative complement pathway results in depressed serum C3 and CH50 levels (usually with a normal C4) that resolve after several weeks. Diagnosis requires the  clinical  picture  of  acute  nephritis  (hematuria,  proteinuria, hypertension, and edema), together with evidence of recent GAS infection (culture or serology) and a compatible complement pro{le. Renal biopsy is reserved for atypical features, such as anuria or prolonged  reduced  renal  function,  and  depressed  complement that  does not improve after several weeks. 25 See T able 40.2 for differential diagnoses.

TREATMENT
GAS  remains  universally  sensitive  to  penicillin,  which  is  the treatment of choice. 5,23 Although treatment failures occur, they never occur due to in vitro non-susceptibility. As penicillins target cell  wall  synthesis,  they  may  be  less  effective  in  the  stationary phase  of  bacterial  growth when  penicillin-binding  proteins  are not  expressed.  This  is  thought  to  occur  in  severe  infections complicated by large bacterial loads, the Eagle effect. 12 However, in instances where alternative antibiotics may be used because of differing  mechanisms  of  action,  they  are  generally  given  as  an adjunct  to-rather  than  in  replacement  of-penicillin  therapy. Erythromycin and the newer macrolides have been used for GAS

============================================================
TREATMENT
In populations in whom ARF is now rare, antibiotics for the routine treatment of GAS pharyngitis is contentious because of the usually self-limiting nature of the illness. A Cochrane systematic review suggested that treatment of a sore throat with antibiotics reduces symptoms by 32% on day 3 and 51% on day 7, although it was noted that 82% of controls have self-resolved by day 7. It was noted that treatment decreased the risk of rheumatic fever by 73% and the risk of peritonsillar abscess by 85%; however, in low-incidence settings, the numbers needed to treat to prevent complications are likely to be very large. Therefore the aim of antibiotic  treatment,  if  used,  is  alleviation  of  symptoms  and shortening the duration of illness. T reatment of GAS pharyngitis is  essential in populations with a high incidence of ARF and, if diagnostic facilities are limited, empiric treatment of all sore throat cases may be justi{ed. The use of antibiotics to reduce the risk of  subsequent  APSGN  is  limited  due  to  insuf{cient  studies. 26 Treatment recommendations are detailed in Table 40.4. T en days of twice-daily oral penicillin V or a single dose of intramuscular benzathine penicillin G (BPG) is the preferred treatment for GAS, although once-daily oral amoxicillin appears to be effective for symptom resolution and GAS eradication. 5 Short courses (up to 5 days) of macrolides have been shown to have equivalent clinical and  short-term  microbiologic  cure  rates,  but  the  risk  of  late microbiologic failure may be higher. There are insuf{cient data regarding the ef{cacy of short-course or non-penicillin regimens for  preventing  ARF.  T reatment  of  impetigo  may  be  with  oral, intra-muscular, or topical antibiotics, although topical treatment is  discouraged in high-prevalence  settings because of the rapid emergence of antimicrobial resistance. A randomized controlled trial  in  north  Australia  showed  non-inferiority  of

short-course oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole) compared with the single-dose BPG. The co-trimoxazole group had improved clearance of staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). 27 Options for treatment are given in T able 40.4.
Penicillin is the treatment of choice for invasive infection where GAS  is  con{rmed  or  highly  likely  (e.g.,  erysipelas  or  perianal cellulitis). Because of the narrow spectrum of penicillin, empirical treatment  before  microbiologic  con{rmation  is  generally  with one or more alternative antimicrobials. For example, an

Possible ARF
As  necrotizing  soft  tissue  infections  may  be  polymicrobial, broad-spectrum cover (e.g., with a carbapenem + clindamycin ± vancomycin)  is  recommended  until  the  microbiologic  cause  is con{rmed. Urgent and aggressive debridement of non-viable tissues has  been  the  cornerstone  of  management  of  GAS  necrotizing fasciitis,  along  with  intensive  supportive  care  and  antibiotics. 23 Clindamycin is recommended as an adjunct to penicillin for the treatment of severe invasive GAS disease, including necrotizing infections,  during  the  {rst  few  days  of  treatment.  Clindamycin has multiple mechanisms of action, targeting protein synthesis as opposed to penicillin-binding proteins and exhibiting an inhibitory effect against super-antigens, thereby reducing the in|ammatory response. Observational studies have demonstrated a bene{t of clindamycin  in  reducing  mortality  in  patients  with  necrotizing fasciitis. 8 In instances where clindamycin is used, penicillin should always be given unless there is a history of hypersensitivity. Although supportive data are limited, administration of one or two doses of  intravenous  immunoglobulin  (IVIG)  early  in  the  course  of STSS is recommended. Although some studies have shown bene{t of early IVIG for preventing the need for surgery in STSS, this should not delay early exploration and aggressive debridement, which remain the current recommended treatment in necrotizing fasciitis. 23 IVIG is also recommended by some as adjunctive treatment in severe invasive GAS infections, even in the absence of toxic shock.
Management of ARF is primarily symptomatic. Penicillin is generally given to eradicate colonization, although acute infection has usually passed by the time symptoms of ARF develop. Salicylates or non-steroidal anti-in|ammatories are used to relieve fever and pain from arthritis, which is often severe. Where necessary, cardiac failure is managed with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Steroids are sometimes used in cases of severe carditis,  although  there  is  no  evidence  that  they  improve  the long-term outcome in RHD. Mitral valve repair, balloon valvuloplasty, or valve replacement may be required to manage patients with severe valve disease. 24

Contacts of patients with GAS infection may be colonized with the same GAS strain, but primary prophylaxis of contacts is rarely indicated for simple GAS pharyngitis. For contacts of severe invasive GAS infection, approximately 250 people would need to be treated to prevent one severe infection, and many experts now recommend routine treatment of close contacts. 5,8 If prophylactic treatment of contacts is attempted, regimens combining rifampin with penicillin, or using alternative antibiotics such as cephalosporins or azithromycin, are usually recommended as a result of the increasing failures of penicillin alone in eradicating carriage. 5
Regular secondary prophylaxis is recommended for all children  and adults with  previous  ARF or established RHD to prevent recurrence. Current guidelines recommend intramuscular BPG four times a week for 10 years. Secondary prophylaxis is central to the management of children and adults with ARF/RHD (see T able 40.4).
During  outbreaks of APSGN secondary to GAS pyoderma, community-based  treatment  of  infected  individuals  and  their contacts  with  BPG  appears  to  decrease  the  transmission  of nephritogenic GAS strains. In addition to treating infected individuals, reducing the transmission of GAS pyoderma in resource-limited settings is likely to require skin hygiene measures, including the control of scabies.

Work  continues  on  the  development  of  a  vaccine  targeted against  GAS,  the  most advanced of the  current candidates  is a multi-valent  vaccine  containing  30  of  the  most  common  GAS emm types encountered in North America and Europe, which is currently  undergoing  clinical  trials.  There  is  a  limited  match between these strains and prevalent emm types in Africa and the Paci{c, where emm types are more variable, but potential serotype cross-reactivity  may  provide  broader  strain  protection.  Other candidate vaccines, containing antigens conserved among most, or all, GAS strains, are approaching clinical trial phase. 28
