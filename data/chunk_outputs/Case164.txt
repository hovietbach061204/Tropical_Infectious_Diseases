Key features
- Melioidosis is an infection by Burkholderia pseudomallei , an environmental, saprophytic, Gram-negative bacterium found in water and soil in South and East Asia and Northern Australia. In endemic areas, it accounts for up to 20% of community-acquired septicemias
- Glanders is an infection with Burkholderia mallei , a pathogen of horses and other equines; it is now very rare
- Melioidosis predominantly a.ects adults with underlying diabetes, chronic renal disease, alcoholism, cirrhosis, or immunosuppression
- Pneumonia, septicemia, and metastatic abscess formation (often in liver, spleen, lungs, and muscle) are common; mortality approaches 50%
- In children, B. pseudomallei causes a unique syndrome of acute suppurative parotitis
- Treatment is with high doses of parenteral ceftazidime or a carbapenem, followed by oral doxycycline and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to complete 20 weeks of antibiotic treatment

INTRODUCTION
The first description of glanders, a disease primarily of horses caused by Burkholderia  mallei ,  is  usually  attributed  to  Aristotle  who  wrote 'The ass  suffers chiefly  from one particular  disease  which they  call 'melis' . It arrives first in the head, and a clammy humour runs down the  nostrils,  thick  and  red;  if  it  stays  in  the  head  the  animal  may recover, but if it descends into the lungs the animal will die.' Thereafter, the nasal and pulmonary infection (glanders) and subcutaneous abscesses (farcy) of horses, mules, and donkeys were well known as a  potential  threat  to  humans.  In  Rangoon  in  191 1,  Whitmore  and Krishnaswami  documented  a  'hitherto  undescribed  glanders-like illness' among the ill and neglected inhabitants of the town' [1]. The disease, killing emaciated morphine addicts who languished on the streets of Rangoon, was caused by a bacterium 'sufficiently peculiar to distinguish it from all pathogenic bacteria previously known to us' . Whitmore demonstrated that Koch's postulates could be fulfilled and he proposed the name Bacillus pseudomallei for the newly discovered bacterium. By 1917, Krishnaswami had reported over 100 cases from Rangoon (5% of all post-mortem examinations). Sporadic cases were reported  during,  and  following,  the  Second  World  War  and  many more cases were reported in soldiers fighting in Vietnam during the war  of  independence  with  France  and  the  later  conflict  involving the  USA. The Vietnam  War  experience skewed clinical descriptions towards more chronic forms of the infection and reactivations long after exposure. Very few cases were reported in indigenous people in South and East Asia, but with improvements in hospital microbiology facilities in some countries over the past two decades, melioidosis has been increasingly recognized throughout this populous region [2, 3]. The clinical and pathologic picture seen today is much as Whitmore originally described it. Meanwhile, glanders in equines has become a rarity and human cases are extremely unusual.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Areas of the world endemic for melioidosis are generally within the latitudes 20 ° S and 20 ° N [2]. In recent years, there have been increasing numbers of case reports of human melioidosis from Southern China, Taiwan, many areas of Southeast Asia, and the south of India. These are areas inhabited by a significant proportion of the world's population. Cases have also been described in Brazil and Africa (Fig. 71.1). Thus,  as  with  many  tropical  bacterial  diseases,  our  current  understanding  of  epidemiology  reflects  the  distribution  of  microbiology laboratories capable of making the diagnosis. In the case of melioidosis, current estimates of the global burden are likely to be a considerable underestimate. Burkholderia pseudomallei is also a major veterinary pathogen in Australia and a major problem for zoos. It causes lethal infections  in  many  species,  but  large  primates  (notably  highland gorillas),  certain  bird  species,  and  sea  mammals  are  particularly vulnerable.
In endemic areas, melioidosis is a rainy season disease. It predominantly affects people who have direct contact with wet soils and who have  an  underlying  predisposition  to  infection.  These  are  patients with diabetes mellitus, renal disease (calculi, renal failure), and cirrhosis, or patients who are immunosuppressed, either as the result of disease or drug treatment [3] but, interestingly, it is not specifically associated with HIV infection. Diabetes is the most important predisposing condition, accounting for about half of cases. The infection may present at any age, with the peak incidence in the fourth and fifth decades  of  life,  which  reflects  the  appearance  of  the  underlying predisposing illnesses. In northeast Thailand, where B.  pseudomallei accounts  for  20%  of  community-acquired  septicemias,  the  average annual incidence (1987-1991) was estimated to be 4.4 per 100,000, but this is increasing steadily as the local population is living longer with improved health services and economic conditions. In Singapore (1991-1994),  where  melioidosis  accounts  for  7%  of  communityacquired pneumonias, incidence was estimated at 1.6 per 100,000 per year. In the Top End of the Northern Territory, Australia, where melioidosis is the commonest cause of fatal septicemic pneumonia, annual incidence between 1989 and 1999 was 16.5 per 100,000 [4].

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Serologic studies in Thailand indicate that exposure occurs as soon as the infant makes contact with soil and water, with seroconversion of approximately  25%  per  year  for  the  first  4  years  of  life.  Exposure occurs very frequently during rice farming (a major occupation in the region). Thus, the majority of the population in endemic areas have serologic  evidence  of  exposure,  but  there  is  no  evidence  that  this antibody is  protective.  Disease  either  results  from  a  failure  of  host defense, resulting from disease or drugs or, less commonly, a particularly large inoculum (major trauma, near drowning).

NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
interferon-gamma is essential for host defense, but other components are also important.
Burkholderia pseudomallei is a soil saprophyte and can be readily recovered  from  water  and  wet  soil  (often  rice  paddy  fields)  in  endemic areas  [5].  The  bacterium  is  a  motile,  aerobic,  non-spore-forming, Gram-negative bacillus. In contrast, B. mallei is an obligate pathogen . The genome of B. pseudomallei is one of the largest and most complex bacterial  genomes  yet  sequenced.  It  comprises  7.24  Mb,  divided un  equally  between  two  circular  chromosomes  (4.07  Mb  and  3.17 Mb) encoding ~5800 genes with an overall G + C content of 68%. The molecular and epidemiologic evidence suggests that mammalian pathogenicity  is  unimportant  in B.  pseudomallei ecology,  whereas B.  mallei appears  to  have  undergone  reductive  evolution  from  a B. pseudomallei ancestor (they have 99% homology in conserved genes) and in adapting to its equine host has shed approximately 1.41 Mb of DNA containing the genes necessary for soil survival. Burkholderia pseudomallei, like many soil bacteria, is a difficult organism to kill: it can survive in triple-distilled water for years; it is resistant to complement and lysosomal defensins and cationic peptides; it survives inside several cell lines; and it produces proteases, lipase, lecithinase, catalase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, hemolysins, and siderophores. The genome encodes many classical virulence genes, such as adhesins, fimbriae, exopolysaccharides, and Type III secretion systems [6]. The cell wall lipopolysaccharide, which is the immunodominant antigen, is highly conserved and contains two distinct O-polysaccharides. Burkholderia pseudomallei produces a highly hydrated glycocalyx 'capsule' -  an  important  virulence  determinant  -  that  forms  a  slime.  This facilitates  the  formation  of  microcolonies  in  which  the  organism is  both  protected  from  antibiotic  penetration  and  phenotypically altered. Organisms that cause invasive disease are indistinguishable from those found in the environment.

NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
Melioidosis in humans is usually acquired by inoculation or inhalation. There is no evidence it can be acquired by ingestion. Occasional nosocomial  infections  have  occurred  and  sexual  transmission  has been reported twice. Rice farmers suffer repeated minor cuts and abrasions  whilst  immersed  for  much  of  the  day  in  water  containing B.  pseudomallei ,  but  they  do  not  develop  active  infection  unless  an underlying  predisposing  condition  develops.  The  risk  of  disease  is proportional  to  the  concentration  of  organisms  in  the  soil.  Neutrophils play a central role in innate host defense, which is initiated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs; principally TLR-2) [6]. In animal models,
Human infection with B. mallei has occurred rarely among laboratory workers and those in direct contact with infected animals. Person-toperson spread of B. mallei is extremely rare. The bacteria usually enter the body through the eyes, nose, mouth, cracked skin, or cuts. Direct contact  with  the  skin  can  lead  to  a  localized  cutaneous  infection. Inhalation leads to pneumonia, septicemia, or disseminated abscesses in muscle, liver, and spleen - a pattern similar to that of melioidosis. Burkholderia  mallei is  a  dangerous  organism  in  the  laboratory  and should be investigated only in Biosafety Level (BSL) 3 facilities. It is highly infectious as an aerosol and, as infection requires only a few organisms, it has been used as a biological warfare agent. Use during the American Civil War, World Wars I and II, and the Russian invasion of Afghanistan has all been reported.

CLINICAL FEATURES
Melioidosis presents as a febrile illness, ranging from a chronic, debilitating, localized infection to an acute, fulminant septicemia characterized by local or metastatic abscess formation [5]. Usually, there is no  obvious  infected  wound  or  trauma.  The  majority  of  cases  are septicemic.  Nearly  all  clinical  studies  have  come  from  Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and Northern Australia. The overall mortality in adults in Thailand is approximately 50%, with many deaths occurring rapidly before microbiologic confirmation. In Northern Australia, the mortality of severe melioidosis has been falling in recent years with earlier recognition and intensive care treatment [4]. The lung is the most commonly affected organ, presenting either with a lung abscess or  pneumonia, or secondary multifocal 'blood-borne pneumonia' . Large or peripherally sited lung abscesses commonly rupture into the pleural space to cause empyema. Seeding and abscess formation may occur in any organ, although the liver, spleen, skeletal muscle, and prostate are relatively common sites. Renal abscesses are often associated with calculi and urinary infection. In nearly 3000 patients prospectively studied in Thailand, a wide variety of clinical presentations have  been  seen,  but  primary  meningitis  or  endocarditis  have  not (although secondary meningitis from cerebral abscesses and mycotic aneurysms  does  occur).  Melioidosis  may  present  as  an  uncomplicated,  localized  infection  of  the  skin,  subcutaneous  tissues,  or  eye. Corneal ulcers secondary to trauma and then exposure to contaminated water are rapidly destructive. Metastatic pyomyositis is relatively
common. Melioidosis causes acute suppurative parotitis. This unique syndrome occurs mainly in children (29% of pediatric cases, 1% of adult cases,) with no other evidence of an underlying predisposing condition. In approximately 10% of cases, the parotitis is bilateral. The patient presents with fever, pain, and swelling over the parotid gland. In advanced cases, there may be rupture either to the skin or through to the external ear. Incision and drainage are often required; great care must be taken to avoid damaging the facial nerve. Delay in drainage may also result in a permanent Bell's palsy.

CHUNK 7
============================================================
CLINICAL FEATURES
In  approximately  4%  of  cases  from  Australia  and,  less  commonly, elsewhere  ( < 0.2%  of  cases  in  Thailand),  melioidosis  presents  as  a brainstem  encephalitis  with  peripheral  motor  weakness  or  flaccid paraparesis. Prominent features of the brain stem syndrome on presentation are unilateral  limb  weakness,  cerebellar  signs,  and  cranial nerve palsies. Focal, multiple, small microabscesses in the brainstem and spinal cord are thought to be the cause. The clinical experience from Northern Australia is generally similar to that in Southeast Asia, but with two other notable differences; parotid abscess is uncommon (although children comprise only 4% of cases compared with 15% in  Thailand)  and  genitourinary  infections  (commonly  prostatic abscess) comprise 15% of cases compared with < 2% elsewhere.
Glanders is characterized by initial onset of fever, rigors, and malaise culminating in a  rapid onset  of  pneumonia,  bacteremia,  skin  pustules, and disseminated abscesses. Death occurs in 7-10 days without antibiotic treatment. Even with antibiotic treatment, septicemic glanders has a mortality of 50%. The course of infection depends on the route of acquisition.

PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Melioidosis should be suspected in any severely ill febrile patient with an underlying predisposing condition who lives in, or has traveled from, an endemic area. The differential diagnosis includes any other bacterial cause of septicemia, cavitating pneumonia, or abscess formation. In northeast Thailand, B. pseudomallei is the most common cause of septicemic illness during the rainy season in adult diabetics. There is  often  abscess  formation,  either  in  the  lungs  (seen  on  the  chest radiograph) or in the liver and spleen (seen on ultrasound examination). Splenic abscess is a pointer to melioidosis in endemic areas (in northeast Thailand, 95% of splenic abscesses are caused by B. pseudomallei). In  up  to  13%  of  cases  with  septicemia,  subcutaneous abscesses  are  present  in  which  Gram-negative rods  can  be  demonstrated. Burkholderia pseudomallei is readily cultured from infected sites or  the  blood.  Throat swab culture  is 90% sensitive compared with sputum culture and is more easily obtained in children or debilitated patients.

============================================================
CHUNK 9
============================================================
PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
In  the  laboratory, B.  pseudomallei grows  aerobically  on  most  agar media producing clearly  visible  colonies  within  48  hours  at  37 ° C. Ashdown's selective medium (a simple agar containing crystal violet, glycerol, and gentamicin) is commonly used to culture the organism. The colonies develop a characteristic appearance (becoming rugose, or cornflower head-like, with a silvery sheen) and they take up the crystal violet dye [7]. Gram-stain reveals Gram-negative rods that are often described as bipolar staining or like safety pins - although in clinical specimens morphology and staining is extremely variable. The organism is oxidase-positive, utilizes glucose by an oxidative pathway and  can  be  reliably  identified  from  its  biochemical  profile  using kit-based  systems. Burkholderia  pseudomallei is  intrinsically  resistant to many antibiotics. In general, it is susceptible to chloramphenicol, the  tetracyclines,  trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,  ureidopenicillins, third-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems and, unusually for a 'pseudomonad', amoxicillin-clavulanate. Burkholderia pseudomallei is intrinsically resistant to other penicillins, first- and second-generation cephalosporins, macrolides, rifamycins, colistin, and the aminoglycosides.  Rare,  naturally  occurring  mutants  have  been  reported  that lack  the  efflux  pump  and  are  susceptible  to  both  macrolides  and aminoglycosides. The fluoroquinolones have weak activity and have proved very disappointing in clinical trials. This unusual antibiotic, susceptibility  profile  (i.e.  gentamicin  and  colistin  resistance  but co-amoxiclav  susceptibility)  in  an  oxidase-positive,  Gram-negative rod is also useful for rapid identification. Burkholderia mallei generally shows a similar pattern of antimicrobial susceptibility, except that it is gentamicin-sensitive.

============================================================
CHUNK 10
============================================================
PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Cultures  should  be  plated  on  routine  blood  agar  and  Ashdown's selective medium. Swabs from open, contaminated sites should also be placed in a selective pre-incubation broth. Small colonies are often evident on agar plates in 24 hours. The median time to blood culture positivity is 48 hours but is shorter with automated systems. Direct immunofluorescence on sputum, urine, or pus is 98% specific and approximately  70%  sensitive  compared  with  culture  but  allows  a diagnosis to be made in less than 30 minutes. Burkholderia pseudomallei has a characteristic biochemical profile and can be rapidly identified  by  specific  latex  agglutination  tests.  The  definitive  diagnosis  of melioidosis is made by isolation of B. pseudomallei from any site; the organism is not carried asymptomatically. In the past, serologic tests, such as the indirect hemagglutination (IHA) assay were used widely. The  IHA  predominantly  detects  antibodies  directed  against  the remarkably  conserved  lipopolysaccharide  -  the  immunodominant antigen. Serologic tests may be of value in excluding melioidosis or supporting the diagnosis in areas where prevalence is low; however, they are of less value in endemic areas where a significant proportion of the population is seropositive.

============================================================
CHUNK 11
============================================================
TREATMENT
Initial intensive care management of severe melioidosis is similar to that of any severe Gram-negative septicemia. Patients should be resuscitated with adequate intravenous fluids as hypovolemia is common in  the  acute  phase.  There  have  been  eight  randomized  trials  of parenteral antibiotic treatment and four of oral eradication therapy, all conducted in northeast Thailand. Carbapenems kill B. pseudomallei more rapidly than cephalosporins. Imipenem proved equivalent to ceftazidime  in  a  large,  randomized  trial.  Meropenem  is  currently being evaluated, but the most evaluated drug has been ceftazidime. Thus,  the  antibiotics  of  choice  are  ceftazidime  or  a  carbapenem (meropenem or imipenem; see Table 71-1). Other third-generation cephalosporins are less effective. Parenteral co-amoxiclav was associated with a similar mortality to ceftazidime, but had a higher rate of treatment failure. Cefoperazone-sulbactam has also proved effective. Thus, co-amoxiclav is an appropriate empirical treatment for septicemia in areas where melioidosis is endemic, but treatment should be  changed  to  ceftazidime  or  a  carbapenem  once  the  diagnosis  of melioidosis  has  been  confirmed.  Large  and  accessible  abscesses should be drained. Melioidosis is difficult to treat. Systemic infections respond very slowly to specific treatment. The median time to fever

TREATMENT
*or 19 mg/kg IV stat followed by a continuous infusion of 3.5 mg/kg/h. Parenteral treatment should continue until there is clear improvement and the patient can take oral medications. Parenteral treatment should be given for at least 10 days. The therapeutic response is very slow (median fever clearance: 9 days). Physicians often switch antibiotics prematurely, fearing the emergence of resistance (which occurs in < 3% of patients). Dosages often require adjustment for renal failure. Other third-generation cephalosporins (e.g. cefotaxime, ceftriaxone) should not be used, as these have been associated with an increased mortality despite apparent in vitro susceptibility.

resolution is 9 days. Patients with large abscesses or empyema may have  high  swinging  fevers  for  more  than  1  month.  Inexperienced physicians commonly  switch antibiotic treatment prematurely, fearing that the persistent fever reflects the emergence of drug resistance. This is rare; resistance develops to the ß-lactam antibiotic in less than 1% of treated cases. High-dose parenteral treatment should be given for a minimum of 10 days in systemic infections and the switch to oral treatment only made when there is clear evidence of clinical improvement.  Enlargement  of  an  abscess  or  appearance  of  new abscesses, particularly in skeletal muscle, or seeding to a joint, is not uncommon in the first week of treatment and it is not necessarily a sign of treatment failure. Blood cultures are usually negative by the end of the first week, whereas infected sputum or draining abscesses can remain culture-positive for 1 month in infections that are responding to treatment.

CHUNK 13
============================================================
TREATMENT
Oral treatment is with a three-drug combination of doxycycline, trimethoprim, and sulfamethoxazole continued for a full 20 weeks of treatment (see Table 71-2). Whether this regimen can be simplified to  trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole alone is currently being studied. In  pregnant  women  or  children,  high-dose  amoxicillin-clavulanate acid may be given as an alternative. Despite this protracted course, the recurrence rate is approximately 10%, which rises to nearly 30% if 8 weeks of antibiotic treatment or less is given. In Thailand, the median time to recurrence is 21 weeks. Two-thirds of recurrences are relapses and a third are re-infections. The prognosis of melioidosis is better in children and relapse is rare. Adult patients require life-long follow-up. The  optimum  duration  of  maintenance  treatment  for  suppurative parotitis has not been determined but, in general, 8 weeks of treatment  are  sufficient.  These  patients  do  not  relapse  and  the  overall prognosis is good.
