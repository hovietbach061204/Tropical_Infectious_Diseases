Key features
- Zoonotic parasitic disease principally transmitted between wild canids (e.g. foxes) and small mammals, mainly rodents. Domestic dogs ands cats can also become infected
- Human alveolar echinococcosis occurs in central Europe, much of Russia, the Central Asian republics and western China, the north-western portion of Canada and western Alaska
- The liver is the primary organ a+ected by the larval form of Echinococcosis multilocularis, but local extension may occur followed by metastases to lungs and brain
- Computed tomography (CT) can identify liver lesions caused by E. multilocularis ; puri*ed E. multilocularis antigens are highly speci*c and allow discrimination between infections of E. multilocularis and Echinococcosis granulosus
- Treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy with anthelminthic agents and liver transplantation for advanced cases
- Contact with dogs and foxes in areas where the infection is endemic should be avoided. Infection in dogs and cats prone to eat infected rodents can be prevented by monthly treatments with praziquantel

INTRODUCTION
Alveolar echinococcosis is infection by the larval (metacestode) form of Echinococcus  multilocularis .  It  is  also  known  as  alveolar  hydatid disease.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Alveolar echinococcosis has been reported in parts of central Europe; much of Russia;  the  Central  Asian  republics;  north-eastern,  northwestern and western China; the north-western portion of Canada; and western Alaska [1]. Foxes may play an important role in the zoonotic transmission of alveolar echinococcosis as demonstrated by increased incidence of human alveolar echinococcosis in certain endemic areas of Europe from a mean of 0.10 per 100,000 during 1993-2000 to a mean of 0.26 per 100,000 during 2001-2005 following an increase in the population of foxes [1-3]. It also appears that the parasite has spread from endemic to non-endemic areas in North America and North Island, Hokkaido, Japan, owing primarily to the movement, or relocation, of foxes. Certain occupation groups such as hunters, trappers, and persons who work with fox fur are often exposed to alveolar
High rates of infection (hyperendemic foci) have also been reported in some Eskimo villages of the North American tundra, where local dogs develop tapeworm infection as  a result of  regular  feeding  on infected  rodents  that  live  as  commensals  around  dwellings  [4]. Humans become infected with E.  multilocularis by  their  association with the dogs. In central Europe, infected foxes expel eggs which are eaten by rodents inhabiting cultivated fields and gardens and these, in turn, may be a source of infection for dogs. Individuals who own dogs that kill game, or dogs that roam outdoors unattended, have a higher risk of alveolar echinococcosis than those who do not [5]. A higher risk of alveolar echinococcosis has been observed in farmers. Foxes and rodents of the genera Microtus and Peromyscus are involved in the cycle in rural regions of central North America [6].

NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
Small mammals, mainly rodents, act as natural intermediate hosts. Humans  are  accidental,  dead-end  hosts  who  acquire  infection  by ingesting eggs shed in feces by the definitive host-typically foxes that are infected with the adult tapeworm [1]. The embryo or oncosphere hatches from the egg in the small intestine of humans and is transported  to  the  liver  where  it  forms  multilocular  hydatid  cysts.  In humans, the larval mass resembles a malignancy in appearance and behavior, because it proliferates indefinitely by exogenous budding and  invades  the  surrounding  tissues.  Unlike  cystic  echinococcosis, protoscolices are rarely observed in human infections. Fox and coyote populations have increasingly encroached upon suburban and urban areas  of  many regions  and,  as  a  result,  domestic  dogs  or  cats  may become infected, developing the tapeworm when they eat infected wild rodents [1].
Alveolar echinococcosis is a serious disease; however, improvements in treatment in the last 30 years have had a positive impact on the life expectancy of patients. A recent study found that the life expectancy of an average 50-year-old patient with alveolar echinococcosis, was reduced by 18.2 and 21.3 years for males and females in 1970 respectively. By 2005, the life expectancy reduction was 3.5 and 2.6 years, for males and females, respectively [7].

CLINICAL FEATURES
In  both  humans  and  natural  intermediate  hosts,  the  liver  is  the primary  organ  affected  by  the  metacestode  of E.  multilocularis, but local extension can occur followed by metastases to lungs and brain [1].  In  chronic  infections,  the  lesion  consists  of  a  central  necrotic cavity filled with a white amorphous material that is covered with a thin  peripheral  layer  of  dense  fibrous  tissue.  Areas  of  calcification may exist, as does extensive infiltration by proliferating vesicles. The initial  symptoms  of  alveolar  hydatid  disease  are  usually  vague  and include upper quadrant and epigastric pain, jaundice, hepatomegaly,

sometimes fever and anemia, weight loss, and pleural pain. Mortality in patients can occur from hepatic failure, invasion to adjacent structures, or, less frequently, metastases to the brain. The mortality rate in progressive,  clinically  manifest  cases  may  be  50-75%.  Instances  of spontaneous  death  of  the  alveolar  lesion  during  its  early  stage  of development have been reported in people with asymptomatic infection [4].

PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Alveolar echinococcosis will generally become symptomatic in older individuals, closely  mimicking hepatic carcinoma or cirrhosis. Hepatomegaly  and  characteristic  scattered  areas  of  radiolucency outlined  by  calcified  rings  2-4  mm  in  diameter  can  be  observed in plain radiographs. CT will typically show indistinct solid tumors with  central  necrotic  areas  and  perinecrotic,  plaque-like  calcifications  [8].
Serologic  tests  for E.  multilocularis are  highly  sensitive  and  usually positive at high titers. Discrimination between infections with E. multilocularis and E. granulosus can be accomplished by using highly specific  serological  assays  that  use  purified E.  multilocularis antigens [9,10]. Diagnosis can be confirmed by demonstrating larval elements using  needle  biopsy.  Exploratory  laparotomy  is  often  performed for  diagnosis,  as  well  as  determination  of  the  size  and  extent  of invasion.

TREATMENT
The preferred treatment in alveolar echinococcosis is surgical resection of the entire larval mass, usually by excision of the affected lobe of  the  liver  [1].  Wedge  resections  of  the  lesion  may  be  attempted when involvement is extensive. Often the lesion in alveolar echinococcosis is inoperable because disease is advanced when diagnosed. Long-term treatment (over several years) with mebendazole (50 mg/ kg/day) or albendazole (15 mg/kg/day) inhibits growth of larval E. multilocularis , reduces metastasis and enhances both the quality and length of survival [1 1, 12]; prolonged therapy can eventually be larvicidal  in  some  patients.  Liver  transplantation  has  been  employed successfully in otherwise terminal cases. In a Swiss study, therapy for non-resectable alveolar echinococcosis with mebendazole and albendazole resulted in an increased 10-year survival rate of approximately 80% (versus 29% in untreated historical controls) and a 16-20-year survival rate of approximately 70% (versus 0% in historical controls) [13]. Monitoring of patients with alveolar echinococcosis should be done  by  long-term  follow-up  with  ultrasound  at  shorter  intervals and  CT  and/or  magnetic  resonance  imaging  at  2-3-year  intervals. Progression  is  documented  by  enlargement  of  lesions  over  time. Monitoring of benzimidazole plasma levels after starting treatment is  recommended.
Preliminary in vitro studies suggest nitazoxanide and albendazole may be  parasitocidal  against E.  multilocularis larvae,  but  further  efficacy trials in humans are warranted to assess efficacy [14].
Eliminating E. multilocularis from its wild animal hosts is impractical; therefore, contact with dogs and foxes in areas where the infection is endemic should be avoided. Preventing infection in humans depends on education to improve hygiene and sanitation. Tapeworm infection in dogs and cats prone to eat infected rodents can be prevented by monthly treatments with praziquantel. Clearing rubbish from dwellings and preventing rodent access into buildings will help to decrease the rodent population.
