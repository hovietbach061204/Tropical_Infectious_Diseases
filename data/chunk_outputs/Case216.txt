INTRODUCTION
Paragonimiasis  is the  infection caused by lung  flukes  of  the  genus Paragonimus. More than ten species of Paragonimus are infective to humans; the most commonly reported is P. westermani .  The disease is acquired through eating raw, or undercooked, freshwater crabs (Fig. 125.1) or crayfish containing the infective metacercaria stage of the fluke.

============================================================

============================================================
EPIDEMIOLOGY
There  are  more  than  22  million  people  infected  globally  [1]  and about 200 million people at risk. Paragonimiasis is prevalent in Asia - especially Southeast Asia, Africa, and Central and South America. Paragonimus westermani , or oriental lung fluke infection, is common

in Asia - especially in China, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam, whereas Paragonimus mexicanus causes infection in Central and South America, and Paragonimus africanus and Paragonimus uterobilateralis are the major causes of infection in Africa. Human infection with Paragonimus kellicotti has been reported in the USA.

============================================================
NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOLOGY, AND PATHOGENESIS
The wide variation in pathologic findings depends on the number of infecting worms, duration of infection and tissues affected. Toxic and allergic factors may be involved.
Infection with P. westermani is acquired though ingestion of metacerariae in undercooked, or raw, crab or crayfish. Ingestion of different snails  or  crustaceans  can  lead  to  infection  with  other Paragonimus species. The metacercariae excyst, penetrate the intestinal wall, enter the abdominal cavity and then cross the diaphragm into the lung, where they mature into adult worms over a period of approximately 2 months. Adults worms produce eggs that gain access to the tracheobronchial tree through fistulas from the parasitic lung cyst. Eggs are coughed up and shed into the environment through sputum or after swallowing  and  passage  in  the  feces.  Once  in  freshwater,  the  eggs hatch releasing miracidia that infect snail hosts where parasite amplification and development occurs. Cercariae are released from the snail and infect crustacean hosts. In some cases, infection can be from a paratenic host, such as wild boars [2].

============================================================
PULMONARY LESIONS
Migration of larval flukes in the lungs (and frequently in other tissues) induces local necrosis, hemorrhage and inflammatory exudate, which is followed by fibrous encapsulation into a worm cyst. In the lungs, initial  lesions  are  usually  located  a  few  centimeters  beneath  the pleural  surface,  near  bronchioles  or  bronchi.  Pathology  includes bronchopneumonia, interstitial pneumonia, bronchitis, bronchiectasis,  atelectasis,  fibrosis,  pleural  thickening,  pleural  effusion,  angiitis obliterans, and periphlebitis.
Macroscopically, the worm cysts are 1-4 cm, distended, grayish-white nodules.  In  cross  section  they  have  irregular  outlines  and  cavities, within which are 1-2 worms and, uncommonly, 3, 4 or 0. The total number of cysts in the lungs is usually < 20, with the larger proportion located in the right lung.
Microscopically,  the  cyst  wall  consists  of  granulation  tissue  with fibroblasts, lymphoid cells, mononuclear cells, plasma cells, and eosinophils.  Within  the  cavity  are  numerous  Charcot-Leyden  crystals, Paragonimus eggs, and necrotic material. In the vicinity of the cysts are tunnels, burrows, egg tubercles, and calcified eggs.

============================================================
CHUNK 7
============================================================
ECTOPIC LESIONS
Young, or even mature, flukes can migrate from the lungs and reach almost any organ, including the breast, psoas muscle, testes, scrotum, spermatic cord, liver, gut wall, other abdominal viscera, uterine and vaginal wall, spinal cord, and brain. In the ectopic site, the flukes reach
sexual maturity. Cysts, granulomas, or abscess can then form around the flukes or their eggs. Some immature flukes migrate from the lungs through the jugular or carotid foramen at the base of the skull to reach the temporal and occipital lobes of the brain, where they produce necrosis and eosinophilic granulomatous reactions. In China, migratory subcutaneous swellings are common with Pagumogonimus skrjabini infection,  and  ova  have  been  found  at  the  centers  of  small eosinophilic granulomas in the pericardium, meninges, and liver.

============================================================
CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
In light infections, the majority of patients are asymptomatic. Even in heavy infections, most patients have few symptoms and appear well, despite severe pathology. The disease can be classified into acute and chronic stages involving pulmonary or extrapulmonary sites.

============================================================
CHUNK 9
============================================================
ACUTE STAGE
This  stage  corresponds to  the  period  of  invasion  and  migration  of young flukes. Although this stage often passes undiagnosed, findings can include diarrhea, abdominal pain, urticaria, and eosinophilia, followed by fever, chest pain, cough, dyspnea, malaise, and night sweats. The symptoms usually spontaneously resolve after 1-2 months.

============================================================
CHUNK 10
============================================================
Pulmonary Paragonimiasis
The  incubation  period  is  about  6  months  (range:  1-27  months). Cough,  sputum  and  chest  discomfort  increase  gradually  and  are similar  to  those  in  chronic  bronchitis.  The  cough  is  spasmodic, usually occurs on walking or after exertion, and is productive. Sputum is characteristically gelatinous, tenacious and rusty-brown. Hemoptysis is common and can be aggravated by strenuous exertion. Pleuritic chest pain is also common. About half of the patients complain of breathlessness  on  exertion  and  some  complain  of  wheezing.  Mild fever may be present.
Physical signs in  the chest  are not  distinct; digital  clubbing  can  be seen. Secondary bronchopneumonia and lung abscess are complications. Pleural involvement includes unilateral or bilateral pleural effusion  or,  in  rare  instances,  pseudochylothorax.  In  endemic  areas, co-infection  of  pulmonary  paragonimiasis  and  tuberculosis  is  not uncommon.

============================================================
CHUNK 11
============================================================
Cerebral and spinal paragonimiasis
In endemic areas of Asia, 25% of hospitalized cases are as a result of brain invasion. Eighty percent of these patients are < 10 years old and most  are  males.  Cerebral  disease  is  particularly  prevalent  in  rural South Korea, where it is the most common cause of cerebral tumor. As many as 10 round or oval cysts, measuring a few millimeters to 10 cm in diameter, are found in the temporal and occipital lobes, near the jugular foramen.
In the acute phase, manifestations can resemble meningoencephalitis. Patients  suffer  headache,  vomiting,  fever,  and  visual  disturbances. With progression, patients can have papilledema, bitemporal hemianopsia, facial palsy, hemiplegia, paraplegia, Jacksonian seizures, and coma. Death during the acute phase is not uncommon. In nonfatal cases, spontaneous remission occurs in 1-2 months, but recurrence may follow. Pleocytosis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with a high eosinophil count is usually seen. Cysts can be demonstrated by computed tomography or angiography.
Rarely, spinal cord involvement presents as paraplegia or monoplegia, with weakness of the extremities and disturbance in sensation.

============================================================
CHUNK 12
============================================================
Abdominal paragonimiasis
Findings  can  include  abdominal  pain  and  tenderness,  bloody diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, palpable nodules, and abscess formation in the liver, spleen, or abdominal cavity. These may simulate a bacterial  infection.  In  some  instances,  cysts  rupture  into  the  intestinal lumen releasing Paragonimus eggs that can be recovered in the feces.

============================================================
CHUNK 13
============================================================
Migratory subcutaneous paragonimiasis
Migratory subcutaneous nodules occur in 20-60% of patients with P. skrjabini and 10% of those with P. westermani infections. They are firm, tender, slightly mobile, a few millimeters to 10 cm in diameter and are often mildly irritating. The most common sites are the lower abdomen, inguinal region, and thigh.
In China, P. skrjabini is  unable to develop to maturity in the lungs. Instead of findings of hemoptysis and ova in the sputum, the striking feature is trematode larva migrans associated with migratory subcutaneous nodules accompanied by marked eosinophilic leukocytosis and necrotic liver lesions. In many cases, the nodules contain juvenile flukes. Brain involvement with subarachnoid hemorrhage occurs.

CHUNK 14
============================================================
PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
A  presumptive diagnosis can be made in  a patient  who  has a history  of  chronic  bronchitis,  blood-streaked  sputum  and  occasional hemoptysis,  and  who  lives  in  an  endemic  area  and  has  eaten  raw crustaceans.
Laboratory  tests  show  an  eosinophilic  leukocytosis.  Chest  radiographs in the early stage show ill-defined opacities. Later radiographic findings include cavitary lesions, lung infiltration (nodular, patchy or linear  type)  (Fig.  125.2),  calcified  foci,  pleural  thickening,  pleural effusions,  and  hilar  enlargement  [3].  Pleural  fluid  can  be  serous, serosanguinous, or chylus.  It is  characteristically  an  exudate  with  a high amount of protein (6-7 g/dl), very low glucose level ( < 10 mg/ dl),  high lactate dehydrogenase (1000 u/dl), elevated percentage of eosinophils (12-75%), and low pH ( < 7.1) [4]. Occasionally, the fluid may be chylous [5].
Confirmation is made by finding characteristic eggs in sputum, stool, pleural effusion, or CSF , or adult flukes in subcutaneous nodules, in other surgical specimens or, rarely, in sputum.
Serologic  diagnosis  can  be  used  for  detection  of  antibody  of Paragonimus spp. via complement fixation, ELISA and immunoblot - they give high sensitivity and specificity [6]. Antigen detection using monoclonal antibody is useful for detecting active infection [7]. Immunodiagnosis  is  particularly  useful  for  diagnosis  of  extrapulmonary disease when paragonimus ova cannot be detected in sputum or stool

samples. Most treated patients become seronegative after about 6-12 months.

============================================================
CHUNK 15
============================================================
PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The differential diagnosis of pulmonary paragonimiasis includes pulmonary tuberculosis, lung abscess, chronic bronchitis or bronchiectasis, and primary and metastatic pulmonary carcinoma. In many areas where tuberculosis is common, the eating of raw freshwater crabs or pork  is  also  common.  Patients  presenting  with  chronic  cough  or hemoptysis with acid-fast bacilli-negative sputum should be investigated for paragonimiasis as the prevalence of paragonimiasis may be as high as 50% and patients can be cured with antihelminthic drugs within a few days. Cerebral and spinal paragonimiasis must be differentiated  from  abscess,  tuberculoma  and  other  helminthic  infections,  including  fascioliasis,  schistosomiasis,  cysticercosis,  hydatid disease, angiostrongyliasis, and gnathostomiasis.
Abdominal  symptoms  mimic  many  acute  conditions,  including appendicitis and amebic liver abscess. Subcutaneous paragonimiasis can be confused with gnathostomiasis, sparganosis, onchocerciasis, and cysticercosis.

============================================================
CHUNK 16
============================================================
TREATMENT
The drug of choice is praziquantel 25 mg/kg three times per day after meals for 3 days. The cure rate is almost 100% [8-10]; only a few patients with heavy infections require a second course of treatment. Symptoms improve rapidly and disappear within a few months. Eggs clear from the sputum in a few weeks, whereas the radiologic pulmonary lesions can take months to clear. The dosage in cerebral paragonimiasis  is  often  higher  and  must  be  adjusted  according  to  the clinical response. Because convulsions and coma have been observed, treatment should proceed in the hospital with corticosteroids administered  to  prevent  brain  edema.  A  randomized,  controlled  trial  in small numbers of patients showed that triclabendazole 5 mg/kg/day for 3 days or 10 mg/kg bid for 1 day orally gives the same cure rate as praziquantel but has a faster egg reduction rate [1 1]. The drug is not available as widely as praziquantel. Bithionol in a dose of 3050 mg/kg/d on alternate days for 10-15 days is also effective, although the drug has treatment-limiting side effects [12]. Surgical resection of ectopic paragonimiasis, such as subcutaneous nodules or masses can cure extrapulmonary paragonimiasis.
Pulmonary  paragonimiasis  is  rarely  fatal;  even  without  treatment, flukes die or disappear within 10-20 years. Pleural effusions can be protracted  and  recur  even  after  treatment.  Most  cases  of  cerebral disease are associated with chronic morbidity as a result of epilepsy and other neurologic sequelae. Five percent of the patients die as a result of hemorrhage - usually in the first 2 years of the disease.

============================================================
PREVENTION AND CONTROL
Health education, especially for young school-children, is needed to change the  dietary customs of eating raw, or undercooked, crab or crayfish.  Mass  treatment  with  bithionol  in  some  endemic  areas  in Korea proved effective in reducing the prevalence of paragonimiasis. Mollusciciding is impractical.
