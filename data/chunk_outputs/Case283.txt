Introduction
Historically,  cholera  is  one  of  the  great  scourges  of  mankind. Seven global pandemics have occurred since the early 19th century. 1 The current seventh global pandemic of cholera, caused by Vibrio cholerae O1 biotype El T or, began in Sulawesi, Indonesia, in 1961.
The history of cholera is closely tied to the history of medicine. In 1854 John Snow made the seminal observation that sewagecontaminated  municipal  water  was  the  source  of  cholera  in  a London community, introducing a concept in the germ theory of disease. Robert Koch isolated the causative bacterium during the {fth pandemic in 1883. Oral rehydration solution (ORS), originally developed for the treatment of cholera, has saved millions of lives and  is  one  of  the  landmark  medical  achievements  of  the  20th century.

============================================================
Epidemiology
Today, cholera remains a signi{cant health burden in the developing world. The disease is endemic in Africa, Asia, Central and South America, and now Haiti. 2 The Ganges River Delta is the ancestral epicenter of cholera ('Asiatic cholera'), and predictable seasonal outbreaks occur in this region. Explosive epidemics can occur in areas with limited access to clean drinking water. In Haiti in 2010, cholera  was  introduced  by  a  carrier  from  an  endemic  country, resulting in a deadly outbreak and establishment of endemic cholera on the island. 3
Precise  estimates  of  global  cholera  incidence  are  lacking; limitations in local surveillance and reporting systems and economic disincentives contribute to the global underreporting of cholera. Fig. 47.1 shows the global distribution of cholera based on cases reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2016.

Cholera and Other Vibrios

In endemic areas, cholera exhibits a seasonal pattern with periods of high and low incidence. Risk factors for severe disease (cholera gravis) include younger age, lack of pre-existing immunity, and blood group O status. 4

Natural History, Pathogenesis, and Pathology
Vibrios are  curved,  rod-shaped,  gram-negative  bacteria  that  are highly motile due to the presence of a single polar |agellum. They are found in brackish water environments around the world, often closely associated with zooplankton and other fauna with chitinous exoskeletons. 5 Humans become infected after drinking contaminated water (Fig. 47.2). An extremely high concentration of organisms (up to 100 million bacteria per milliliter) is found in cholera stool. Stool-shed  organisms  are  transiently  hyperinfectious,  and  this adaptation  may  contribute  to  the  explosive  nature  of  cholera epidemics. 6
Strains  of V.  cholerae are  differentiated  serologically  by  the lipopolysaccharide O antigen. T o date, more than 200 serogroups have been identi{ed. Historically, the O1 serogroup has caused the vast majority of disease and is divided into several phenotypically distinct biotypes: El T or and classical are the most common. Both biotypes can be further subdivided into two serotypes: Inaba and Ogawa. In the past 25 years, the El T or biotype has largely replaced the classical biotype and is the cause of the current seventh global pandemic. The O139 serogroup emerged as a cause of disease in 1992 but has remained limited to areas of Asia.
Pathogenic  strains  of V.  cholerae possess  two  key  virulence factors-cholera toxin  and  the  toxin  co-regulated  pilus  (TCP). TCP is a surface pilus that aggregates organisms together on the surface of the small intestine. Cholera toxin is a prototypical AB subunit  toxin. The  B  subunit binds  the  toxin  to  the  surface  of epithelial cells, while the enzymatically active A subunit is translocated into the cell. The A subunit increases cyclic AMP activity, leading  to  the  massive  |uid  and  electrolyte  ef|ux  resulting  in diarrhea that is the hallmark of the disease.

============================================================
Clinical Features
V.  cholerae incubation  period  varies  with  host  susceptibility  and inoculum size, and ranges from several hours to 3 to 5 days. Most cases are mild or asymptomatic, especially in endemic settings. In severe cholera, the characteristic symptom is the frequent passage of profuse 'rice-water' stool (Fig. 47.3)-a watery stool with |ecks of mucus and a typical {shy odor. Stool output can reach as high as 1 liter per hour in severe cases. Abdominal discomfort, lethargy, and vomiting are other common symptoms,  particularly in the early phases of disease; fever is rare.
Examination may reveal sunken eyes (Fig. 47.4), dry mouth, cold clammy skin, decreased skin turgor, or wrinkled hands and feet.  Dehydration  and  electrolyte  abnormalities  are  important complications  of  cholera.  Kussmaul  breathing  may  occur  as  a result of acidosis, and muscle cramping and weakness can occur due  to  loss  of  potassium  and  calcium.  The  peripheral  pulse  is rapid and initially thready; it may become dif{cult to palpate as blood pressure drops. Urine output decreases with time, and renal failure due to hypovolemia or acute tubular necrosis may occur. In children, depletion of glycogen stores and inadequate gluconeogenesis can lead to severe hypoglycemia and coma. Bloodstream invasion by the organism is extremely rare. Laboratory testing of

Patient Evaluation, Diagnosis, and Differential Diagnosis
Cholera often occurs in outbreaks, and the diagnosis should be quickly suspected in areas of poor sanitation when adults or children over  5  years  of  age  develop  acute  watery  diarrhea  resulting  in profound dehydration. Mild-to-moderate cases of V. cholerae may be indistinguishable from infection with other pathogens, such as enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Campylobacter spp., or Salmonella spp.
V. cholerae O1 or O139 infection is con{rmed by the isolation of the  organism in stool  culture, followed by biochemical tests and serogrouping with speci{c antisera. Thiosulfate citrate bile salts sucrose agar or tellurite taurocholate gelatin agar are used for the selective isolation. An immediate diagnosis of cholera can which has excellent sensitivity but a speci{city between 65% and 85% in  {eld  settings.  Cholera  can  be  rapidly  diagnosed  using direct dark-{eld microscopy of stool where motile Vibrio organisms appear like 'shooting stars.'

Treatment
Treatment of cholera is simple and inexpensive, and when appropriately  treated  the  case  fatality  rate  approaches  zero.  Most importantly,  the  |uid  de{cit  and  ongoing  |uid  loss  must  be corrected. Antibiotics can be administered to decrease the duration of  illness  and  bacterial  shedding,  thereby  reducing  health  care service utilization and potentially transmission of disease. Complications such as pneumonia and hypoglycemia in children must be recognized and addressed in a timely manner.

Correction of Fluid Loss
Correction of dehydration through |uid replacement and maintenance remains the cornerstone of cholera treatment.  A cholera patient can lose more than 5% to 10% of their body weight in |uid during the course of the illness. The amount of |uid therapy administered is determined by assessing the level of dehydration (T able 47.1 and Fig. 47.5). Fluid replacement occurs in two phases. In the rescue phase, aggressive |uid replacement is given to replenish the |uid de{cit in a period of 3 to 4 hours. 7 Intravenous |uids should be

used for rehydration in cases of severe dehydration, mental status changes with inability to drink, hypovolemic shock, and profuse vomiting. After resuscitation for |uid loss, ongoing assessment of |uid loss is necessary, and stool output should be measured every 4 to 6 hours. Such measurement can be facilitated using a cholera cot (a simple plastic cot with a central hole to facilitate collection of stool in a bucket). In the maintenance phase ,  intravenous |uid or ORS is given to  replenish ongoing |uid losses. Intravenous and oral rehydration |uids are designed to correct the water and electrolyte loss in cholera stool (T able 47.2). The most commonly used intravenous solution is commercially available Ringer's lactate, or locally prepared |uid which contains more potassium than Ringer' s lactate can be used in endemic countries.
The use of ORS, a readily prepared sugar and salt solution, has revolutionized the treatment of cholera and dehydration caused by other infections. 8 ORS takes advantage of the fact that glucosemediated co-transport of sodium and water across the mucosal surface  of  the  small  intestine  remains  intact  during  diarrhea. Hypo-osmolar  ORS  (Box  47.1)  is  currently  recommended  by the WHO.
Packets for the easy preparation of ORS are widely available in  developing  countries.  If  ORS  packets  are  not  available,

Apart from |uid replacement, the intake of freshly prepared food is encouraged when tolerated, and breastfeeding should be continued where appropriate. For children up to 5 years of age, supplementary administration of zinc (10 mg/day × 2  weeks in children < 6 months; 20 mg/day × 2 weeks in children 6 months to 5 years) has proven effective in reducing the duration of diarrhea, as well as reducing successive diarrhea episodes. 9

Antibiotics
Antimicrobial therapy is  an  adjunct  to  |uid therapy  in  cholera and has been shown to reduce the duration and volume of diarrheal stool and reduce bacterial shedding. 10  The WHO advocates the use of antibiotics for individuals with severe dehydration, basing choice  on  local  availability  and  susceptibility  pattern. 7 A  wide range of antibiotics, both in single- and multiple-dose regimens, is  used  for  the  treatment  of  cholera,  as  shown  in  T able  47.3.
Resistance of V. cholerae O1 and O139 to many commonly used antibiotics is an emerging problem, and thus knowledge of the local resistance pattern is  mandatory. Single-dose regimens are preferred  in  outbreak  settings  where  health  care  personnel  are scarce.

Prevention and Vaccines
A clean water supply is essential to the prevention of cholera, and breastfeeding is protective for young infants in endemic settings. Three oral, whole-cell, killed cholera vaccines are now pre-quali{ed by the WHO and are available in various countries. The WHO recommends use of cholera vaccines in areas of known cholera epidemics and areas at high risk of outbreaks, in conjunction with improved water supplies, adequate sanitation, and health education, 11 and observational data suggest vaccination in epidemic settings is also valuable. 12 Oral cholera vaccines have recently been deployed to prevent epidemics and are increasingly used for this purpose. 13 In 2017 the WHO introduced a global strategy to reduce cholera deaths by 90% by the year 2030. 14

Vibrio parahaemolyticus
V.  parahaemolyticus is  the  most  commonly  isolated  non-cholera Vibrio .  Like V.  cholerae, it  is  found  in  marine  environments. V. parahaemolyticus causes gastroenteritis as a result of consumption of raw or partially cooked food, particularly seafood. V. parahaemolyticus accounts for a large proportion of food-borne illness in Japan, where consumption of seafood is common. The incubation period for V. parahaemolyticus ranges from 4 to 48 hours. Clinical illness tends to be mild, with gastroenteritis symptoms including nausea,  vomiting,  abdominal pain,  and diarrhea. The disease is usually  self-limiting.  Oral  rehydration  is  typically  adequate  for
treatment, and tetracycline or cipro|oxacin can be administered in severe cases.

Vibrio vulnificus
Vibrio species have been isolated from wounds exposed to seawater. V. vulniScus is a particularly important pathogen in Vibrio -associated soft tissue infections and sepsis. Immunocompromised individuals and those  with underlying  liver  disease  are especially prone  to septicemia with V. vulniScus. Thrombocytopenia and disseminated intravascular coagulation are common, along with characteristic bullous skin lesions. The mortality rate is greater than 50% if the infection is not promptly treated. T etracycline appears to be effective in conjunction with other supportive treatments. In severe infection, tissue debridement and amputation of the affected limb may be required.
