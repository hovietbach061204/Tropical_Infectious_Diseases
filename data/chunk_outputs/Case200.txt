Hookworm and Infections 109
Peter J Hotez, Robert H Gilman estimates indicate that hookworm infection is one of the most important parasitic diseases. During the first few decades of the twentieth century hookworm infection was common in the rural southeastern US, but it has been eliminated as a public health problem following urbanization and economic development.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Approximately 600 million people are infected worldwide, with the largest  number  of  cases  in  sub-Saharan  Africa,  Asia,  and  tropical regions of the Americas [2]. Hookworm infection is soil-transmitted and acquired most commonly when infective larvae in the soil penetrate  exposed  human  skin  anywhere  on  the  body.  Environmental factors  favoring  hookworm  transmission  are  extreme  rural  poverty and poor sanitation, appropriate soil conditions, including sandy or loamy soils  that  facilitate  the  migration  of  hookworm  larvae,  high temperatures,  and  adequate  moisture,  rainfall  and  shade.  In  most endemic areas,  similar  to  other  soil-transmitted  helminthiases,  the prevalence of hookworm infection rises sharply in the first few years of  life  and  then  reaches  a  plateau.  However,  unlike  ascariasis  and trichuriasis, the intensity of hookworm infection often continues to rise in adulthood. These observations partly explain the high intensity of hookworm infection found among women of reproductive age and among some elderly populations [3].

NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
Hookworm ova are passed in the feces and develop in the soil (Fig. 109.1). Under optimal conditions, each egg liberates a rhabditiform larva, which gradually doubles in size, and molts twice to become a slender, non-feeding, infective third-stage larva (L3). L3 larvae live in the top one-half inch of soil, with their ends projecting upward from the surface. When contact is made with human skin, the larvae penetrate the skin (including feet, hands, buttocks, and legs) by releasing proteases and other hydrolytic enzymes. A.  duodenale L3  larvae  are also orally infective. Larval migration in the skin is associated with immediate  hypersensitivity.  Following  skin  penetration,  the  larvae gain  access  to  the  venous  circulation  and  are  carried  to  the  lungs, where they migrate through the respiratory tree to the pharynx. Larvae are swallowed, pass through the esophagus and stomach, and arrive in the small intestine before molting to become adults. Eosinophilia typically begins shortly after larvae first enter the gut. Eggs appear in the stool 5 weeks or more after invasion of the skin by infective larvae.
Almost all of the pathology is caused by the adult stages, which are small,  cylindrical, creamy-white nematodes roughly 1 cm in length (Figs  109.1  &  109.2).  At  the  site  of  parasite  attachment in the  gut, hookworms  lacerate  capillaries  in  the  mucosa  or  arterioles  in  the submucosa and  bleeding ensues following secretion  of  hookworm anticoagulants (Figs 109.2 & 109.3). Hookworms ingest host blood, lyse  the  red  cells,  and  then  degrade  host  hemoglobin  through  an ordered cascade of hemoglobin-digesting proteases. It has been estimated that, through this mechanism, 25 adult N. americanus hookworms will cause the loss of 1 mL of blood per day, which contains

Key features
- Hookworm and Strongyloides are intestinal nematodes that penetrate exposed skin, usually of the feet, hands, buttocks, and legs, to establish infection
- Hookworm infection leads to intestinal blood loss and iron-de%ciency anemia, especially in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Infection results in developmental and cognitive delays in children, as well as reductions in future wage earning
- Hookworm is common in pregnant women in low-income countries, resulting in poor birth outcome
- Deworming with benzimidazole anthelminthics is the major therapeutic approach to reduce the number of hookworms in the intestine and improve anemia. For severe anemia, especially for pregnant women, additional iron supplementation may be necessary
- Strongyloides stercoralis infection leads to diarrhea, and can cause chronic infection lasting decades without treatment
- Infection is di&cult to diagnose because of the paucity of larvae detected in feces
- Hyperinfection with Strongyloides is linked to exogenous steroid use or other immune dysregulation and is associated with high mortality
- Deworming with ivermectin is the major therapeutic approach for Strongyloides . In hyperinfection, prolonged treatments are sometimes required, along with management of secondary bacteremias and bacterial meningitis

INTRODUCTION
Human hookworm infection is a global cause of anemia and malnutrition [1]. Approximately 85% of cases are caused by Necator americanus ,  followed  by Ancylostoma  duodenale ; Ancylostoma  ceylanicum , which infects a number of animals, is occasionally found in humans in  restricted  geographic  areas; Ancylostoma  braziliense is  a  cause  of cutaneous larva migrans, and Ancylostoma caninum is a rare cause of eosinophilic enteritis.  The  hallmark of hookworm disease resulting from moderate and heavy infections is iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) due  to  parasite  blood  feeding  and  chronic  blood  loss  [1].  Because hookworms are responsible  for  a  significant  proportion  of  IDA  in low-  and  middle-income  countries,  some  global  disease  burden

Ground Itch and Cutaneous Larva Migrans
Associated  with  the  penetration  of  the  skin  by  L3  larvae,  there  is intense itching, and, in some instances, erythematous, pruritic papules at the site of penetration. Cutaneous larva migrans is a related condition caused by skin penetration of animal hookworms, classically A. braziliense ,  and  results  in  raised,  reddened,  serpiginous  tracks  that mark the migration of the worm. They are the most frequent on the lower  extremities,  followed  by  the  buttocks  and  anogenital  area, although both the trunk and upper extremities may also be affected.

Pulmonary Manifestations
As larvae pass through the lungs, patients may complain of cough and wheezing. In a small percentage of patients, eosinophilic infiltrates appear on chest film.

Gastrointestinal Manifestations
Epigastric  pain  and  tenderness  occur  early  in  the  intestinal  phase. Abdominal pain can be severe enough to suggest peptic ulcer disease.

============================================================
Iron De6ciency Anemia (IDA)
The hallmark of chronic hookworm disease is IDA, which manifests as a microcytic and hypochromic anemia. The development of IDA depends on the number and species of infecting hookworm, the iron reserves and requirements of the host, and the availability of iron in the diet. Lassitude, weakness, apathy, and depression are characteristic of anemia. On physical examination, the mucous membranes, conjunctivae, and skin appear pale. Iron deficiency has also been associated with koilonychia and angular stomatitis. A yellowish-green hue (chlorosis) that results in a sallow complexion can be seen in heavy infections.  Anemia  is  often  accompanied  by  eosinophilia,  and,  in severe cases, protein loss and hypoalbuminemia occur. In children, chronic hookworm infection and disease lead to deficits in growth and physical fitness as well as reductions in intelligence and cognition.  These  changes  can  lead  to  reduced  school  performance  and attendance. IDA from chronic hookworm infection in pregnancy is associated  with  increased maternal morbidity as well  as  low  birthweight  and  prematurity.  Severe  cases  of  hookworm  anemia  and hypoalbuminemia are accompanied by cardiovascular changes.

PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFRENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Hookworm  disease  should  be  considered  in  any  patient  from  an endemic area who presents with anemia, eosinophilia, or both. The diagnosis  is  confirmed  by  identifying  hookworm  ova  in  the  stool (Fig. 109.1). The eggs of N. americanus and A. duodenale are almost

indistinguishable, and both are eliminated in feces in two- to eightcelled stages of cleavage. A clear space is present between the cells and the shell (Fig. 109.1). Direct fecal examination in saline or an iodine solution is suitable  for  detection  of  clinically  significant  infections. This technique identifies persons with more than 1200 eggs per gram of stool. Zinc sulfate flotation or formalin-ether concentration techniques can be  used to  identify  persons  with  lighter  infections.  For purposes  of  epidemiologic  studies,  it  is  sometimes  necessary  to perform quantitative fecal egg counts, which roughly correlate with the number of hookworms in the intestine. The Kato-Katz quantitative method is used widely, but the method requires immediate evaluation as the technique can selectively destroy hookworm eggs over time, leaving only Ascaris , Trichuris , and schistosome eggs in areas of co-endemicity.

============================================================
CHUNK 12
============================================================
TREATMENT
The therapy of hookworm infection disease is treatment with an oral anthelminthic  agent.  In  resource-poor  countries  where  hookworm infection is  endemic,  the  drugs are usually administered  as part of mass  treatment  programs,  either  as  part  of  child  health  days  or through school-based deworming programs on an annual or more frequent  basis  [5].  For  hookworm  infection,  deworming  produces benefits  in  physical  and  intellectual  development  and  hemoglobin levels. For decades, single doses of either of two benzimidazole agents, albendazole or mebendazole, were considered first-line  treatments. However, in a systematic review and meta-analysis, the cure rate of single-dose oral albendazole (400 mg) was 72% and the cure rate of single-dose  mebendazole  (500 mg)  was  only  15%  [6].  Therefore,
FIGURE  109.3 Longitudinal  section  through  hookworm  attached  to intestinal  mucosa. (Courtesy  of  Dr  Pedro  Morera,  Facultad  de  Microbiologia, Universidad de Costa Rica.)
when used as a single dose in mass drug administration, albendazole may be the only acceptable agent. Outside of resource-poor settings, mebendazole when administered in a dose of 100 mg orally twice daily for three successive days may be as effective as albendazole, as well as pyrantel pamoate administered as a dose of 1 1 mg/kg (max. 1 g) for 3 days.

============================================================
CHUNK 13
============================================================
TREATMENT
Because of the teratogenicity and embryotoxicity of albendazole and other benzimidazoles when used in high doses in laboratory animals, two special circumstances warrant caution. In children greater than 1 year but less than 2 years of age, albendazole should be administered at one-half of the recommended dose (200 mg), weighing the effect of chronic  hookworm infection on development and growth, with the theoretical risks of treatment. Similarly, in women in their second and third trimesters of pregnancy, treatment has had proven benefits in terms of reduced maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality [3]. No anthelminthic treatment should be administered during the first  trimester,  but  subsequently  the  risks  of  treatment  need  to  be weighed against the high risk of hookworm infection on pregnancy outcome. During pregnancy, treating anemia of hookworm disease with both anthelminthic drugs and iron therapy is superior to either treatment alone An experimental vaccine to prevent hookworm infection and re-infection is under development [7,8].

INTRODUCTION
Strongyloidiasis,  threadworm  infection,  results  from  infection  by Strongyloides stercoralis ,  the  female of which is usually embedded in the  mucosa  of  the  small  intestine. S.  stercoralis is  unusual  among helminths  in  its  ability  to  multiply  within  the  host  and  maintain persisting infection for years. Recognized since 1876, when Normand described the larvae in stools of French soldiers in Southeast Asia with Cochin-China diarrhea, S. stercoralis has a complex life cycle of entering the skin, migrating through the lungs, and residing in the small bowel (Fig. 109.4).The capacity of S. stercoralis to overwhelm immunocompromised hosts with hyperinfection is well recognized. There is a link between strongyloidiasis and co-infection with human T-cell lymphotrophic  virus  type  1  (HTLV-1)  [9,  10].  Although  almost  all Strongyloides infections are with S.  stercoralis ,  the primate parasite S. fulleborni is recognized in humans in Africa and in Papua New Guinea, where it is a cause of 'swollen belly syndrome' particularly among infants and young children.

============================================================
CHUNK 15
============================================================
EPIDEMIOLOGY
Strongyloidiasis has a patchy, widespread distribution through warm, wet tropical and subtropical areas. In temperate regions, it is encountered  in  institutions  where  sanitary  facilities  are  poor  or  in  moist conditions such as mines or tunnels. Some have conservatively estimated that 30 to 100 million people are infected. The difficulties in diagnosing strongyloidiasis  have  contributed to  our  limited  understanding of the global prevalence and disease burden [9, 10]. Strongyloides infections  are  endemic  in  tropical  Asia,  Africa,  and  Latin America,  as  well  as  in  rural  Appalachia  in  the  US  and  in  parts  of southern and eastern Europe. Although infection is widespread, the prevalence is typically low ( < 10%). Prevalence is reportedly elevated in  older  HTLV-1-affected  patients  in  regions  where  this  virus  is endemic (e.g. Japan, Caribbean).
Immigrants, travelers, or military veterans from endemic areas, e.g., southern Asia, can have prolonged infections. The latter are usually older males, veterans who have lived in endemic tropical areas, and those  with  underlying  malignant,  metabolic,  pulmonary  or  renal disease. They have mild to moderate chronically relapsing symptoms. Because  infection  can  be  maintained  for  40  years  or  more,  and because effective therapy has been available only since 1967, many persons,  e.g.  military  personnel  who  were  in  the  South  Pacific  in World  War  II,  the  Korean  War,  or  the  Vietnam  War,  may  remain infected  and  at  risk  for  episodic  symptoms  of  chronic  infection  or overwhelming hyperinfection, especially if they receive corticosteroid therapy.

============================================================
CHUNK 16
============================================================
NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
The life cycle of S. stercoralis is complex (Fig. 109.4). Like other intestinal nematodes, it can involve host and soil stages. However, unlike most other helminths, the life cycle can also occur completely in the soil (free-living cycle) or completely in the host (internal or external autoinfection). Autoinfection is the basis of both persistence of infection, as  well  as  overwhelming hyperinfection syndrome in patients receiving corticosteroids.
Human infection begins with exposure of the skin to L3 larvae that reside in fecally contaminated, moist soil (Fig. 109.4). These larvae have  slender  bodies,  and  notched tails  that  distinguish  them  from hookworm larvae. The L3 migrate through the lungs and ascend the airways to the trachea and epiglottis before being swallowed to complete their life cycle in the small intestine. There, after two molts, adult females (2.2 mm long) emerge, penetrate and reside in the superficial mucosa of the duodenum and jejunum. The evidence for the existence of male worms is controversial. In the intestine, adult  female worms, eggs, and larvae are found in the superficial submucosa and in the mucosal crypts, causing mechanical trauma, mucous discharge and microscopic ulceration but usually minimal inflammation. Progressive involvement may lead to edema, flattened villi, malabsorption, and even ulceration, enteritis and secondary bacterial invasion.
Nearly  1  month  after  infection,  the  adult  female  lays  oval,  thinshelled, embryonated eggs that closely resemble hookworm eggs but are  usually  not  seen  because  they  rapidly  hatch  in  the  intestinal mucosa to produce first-stage, noninfectious rhabditiform larvae (Fig. 109.5).  It  is  this  rhabditiform  larval  stage  that  is  characteristically found in the stool or  the upper small bowel. Under favorable soil conditions, rhabditiform larvae transform into infective L3 within 24 hours after fecal passage, a process that may also occur in the perianal region after defecation. L3 larvae can also survive for several weeks under  moist  conditions,  and  develop  into  adult  male  and  female worms (Fig. 109.4).

NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY

the  lungs  to  maintain  infection  (Fig.109.4).  Under  selected  conditions, the autoinfective process may become dysregulated, leading to large number of L3 penetrating the gut, cycling through the lungs and re-entering the intestine. This process can lead to hyperinfection, associated secondary bacteremias and bacterial meningitis. Among conditions  associated  with  hyperinfection  are  immunosuppressive  drug therapies,  especially  corticosteroids.  Other  conditions  are  hematologic  malignancies,  solid  organ  transplantations,  and  autoimmune disorders, although in many of these conditions corticosteroids are used during treatment. Infection with HTLV-1 (as well as co-infections with tuberculosis, leprosy, syphilis) is another risk factor; however, the basis for this has not been established. In some patients with hyperinfection, the migrating larvae can develop to adult worms in ectopic sites,  e.g.  the  lung  and  central  nervous  system.  This  condition  is known as disseminated strongyloidiasis. In cases of external autoinfection, the L3 may also develop in the colorectal area and penetrate the  perianal  skin  with  resultant  pruritic  creeping  eruption  or larva currens and external autoinfection .

============================================================
CHUNK 18
============================================================
CLINICAL FEATURES
The clinical manifestations of S. stercoralis infection are acute infection, chronic persisting infection, and the hyperinfection syndrome. The latter two syndromes are the best characterized [9, 10].

============================================================
CHUNK 19
============================================================
Acute Infection
Although an estimated one-third or more of individuals are asymptomatic,  a  pruritic  maculopapular  rash  or  rapidly  migrating  linear urticaria called larva  currens ,  which  is  usually  seen  on  the  buttocks area  with  external  autoinfection,  can  occur.  Cough,  shortness  of breath,  wheezing,  fever,  transient  pulmonary  infiltrates,  and  eosinophilia are infrequent, but may be encountered with the migration of larvae through the lungs. When adult worms develop and penetrate the  mucosa  in  the  small  bowel,  nonspecific  aching  or  epigastric abdominal  pain  and  diarrhea  can  develop.  With  heavy  infections, vomiting, malabsorption, steatorrhea, weight loss, edema, or a paralytic ileus with edema in the small bowel wall are recognized.

============================================================
CHUNK 20
============================================================
Chronic, Persisting Infection
This condition probably occurs as a result of internal autoinfection and is best described in military veterans or in former prisoners of war who have returned from endemic tropical areas in Asia or in the South Pacific. The classically recognized triad  of symptoms is larva currens, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. An endemic focus also occurs in southeastern Kentucky and elsewhere in Appalachia, where most patients are usually white, male, older than 50 years, and from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Viral HTLV-1 infection is an important risk factor for chronic, persisting infection.

Hyperinfection Syndrome
Gastrointestinal  signs  and  symptoms  are  common  but  nonspecific and include crampy abdominal pain, bloating, watery diarrhea and constipation. Patients can develop an ileus and small bowel obstruction, with diffuse tenderness and hypoactive bowel sounds. Pulmonary  manifestations  are  variable,  and  larva  currens  is  common.  Of

special  concern is the high mortality, often with bacterial infection secondary to extensive larval spread from the intestine. Sepsis, meningitis, peritonitis and endocarditis are commonly documented, often with the microbiological recovery of Gram-negative enteric bacteria [9, 10].

============================================================
CHUNK 22
============================================================
PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFRENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Any  individual  from  a  strongyloidiasis-endemic  area  who  is  diagnosed with HTLV-1 infection or who is expected to undergo corticosteroid  therapy  (including  doses  as  low  as  1 mg  of  dexamethasone daily) should be screened for strongyloidiasis. The important aspects of diagnosing Strongyloides infections include a high index of suspicion in patients with histories of exposure and characteristic skin and intestinal  symptoms.  Second,  an  experienced  person  may  have  to diligently search in fecal specimens to find the characteristic rhabditiform  larvae  (Fig.  109.5).  Several  researchers  have  made  efforts  to improve the likelihood of finding Strongyloides larvae by amplifying the indirect life cycle in vitro . They have placed feces on nutrient agar and  looked  for  tracks  of  bacteria  from  migrating  larvae,  used  the Baermann funnel gauze concentration method, or used Harada Mori cultures  on  vertical  strips  of  damp  filter  paper  (where  the  larvae migrate down). Although previous serologic tests were complicated by  lack  of  sensitivity  and  specificity,  an  improved  immunofluorescence antibody assay using Strongyloides antigen has been described. Improved ELISA also gives high specificity and sensitivity, particularly if  combined with Western blot. All immunodiagnostic methods are complicated by cross-reactivity with other nematode helminth infections. Sensitivity may decrease in co-infection with HTLV-1. S. stercoralis antigen is not widely available for routine diagnostic use.

============================================================
CHUNK 23
============================================================
TREATMENT
Because of the potential for chronic symptomatic infection, autoinfection over many years, and the hyperinfection syndrome, all individuals who are infected with S. stercoralis should be treated. The first-line treatment  for  acute  or  chronic  infection  is  ivermectin,  at  a  recommended dose of 200 μ g/kg per day orally, on two successive days. The safety of ivermectin in young children ( < 15 kg) and in pregnancy has not been established. Albendazole at 400 mg orally twice a day for 7 days is an alternative. Albendazole should be taken with a fatty meal to  promote  absorption;  ivermectin  should  be  taken  on  an  empty stomach and with water. Patients with HTLV-1 should be treated until their stools are negative for larvae or until they become seronegative. Treatment of immunocompromised patients suspected of having a life-threatening, hyperinfection syndrome should be continued until the clinical signs resolve. Because the autoinfective life cycle requires at least 2 weeks, some investigators recommend that treatment and screening should continue at least until fecal cultures have been negative for this period of time. A veterinary parental formulation has been used in patients who are unable to take or reliably absorb oral medications. In disseminated strongyloidiasis, combination therapy with albendazole and ivermectin has been suggested, although there are no  carefully  controlled  clinical  trials  to  support  this.  In  patients with hyperinfection, co-infection with enteric bacteria is common, as well  as  bacteremia  and  bacterial  meningitis;  patients  may  require co-administration  of  oral  or  parenteral  antibiotics.  Patients  with Strongyloides hyperinfection are infectious and may require isolation. Following  treatment  for  hyperinfection,  some  clinicians  choose  to keep  patients  on  chronic  suppressive  therapy  with  anthelminthic agents.
