INTRODUCTION
Botulism is a rare, naturally occurring, neuroparalytic illness caused by  potent  neurotoxins  produced  by Clostridium  botulinum and, rarely,  other Clostridium species.  It  manifests  as  a  characteristic syndrome of symmetric cranial nerve palsies followed to a varying extent by symmetric descending paralysis of voluntary muscle that can  progress  to  respiratory  compromise  and  death.  Botulinum spores are ubiquitous in the natural environment, and cases occur worldwide, although are probably greatly under-reported.
The {rst complete clinical description of botulism was published by Kerner in 1822, who termed the disease sausage poisoning, having observed outbreaks associated with the consumption of spoiled meat. The early 20th century saw a massive rise in cases of botulism due  to  the  increasing  popularity  of  food  canning,  particularly home-made preparations in sealed glass jars. After the elucidation of its mechanism of action in the mid-20th century, the potential therapeutic use of botulinum toxin has been exploited. 1-3

NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
C. botulinum are anaerobic, gram-positive, spore-forming bacilli that are found in soils and aquatic sediments. Strains of C. botulinum are classi{ed into seven types, designated A to G, according to the  antigenic  properties  of  the  botulinum  toxin  they  produce. Human botulism is caused by types A, B, E, and rarely  type F. Some strains of C. baratii and C. butyricum can also produce botulinum neurotoxin and have been implicated in human disease.
The spores of C. botulinum are highly resistant. Under appropriate  conditions,  they  germinate  to  release  vegetative  organisms that  produce  neurotoxin.  After  absorption  and  hematogenous dissemination, botulinum toxin exerts its effects at the presynaptic terminals of cholinergic nerve junctions by blocking neurotransmitter release.
Several  naturally  occurring  forms  of  human  botulism  are recognized: food-borne botulism, wound botulism, infant botulism, and  adult  intestinal  toxemia  botulism.  Iatrogenic  botulism  has been reported after the direct inoculation of concentrated botulinum toxin preparations for cosmetic purposes. Intoxication after absorption of toxin across the respiratory mucosa, termed inhalational botulism, is also recognized.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Attempts  to  describe  the  global  epidemiology  of  botulism  are hampered by the lack of detailed incidence data. The necessary public health infrastructure to detect and report cases is lacking in many countries, and few case reports have been published. 4 In particular,  there  is  a  near-complete  absence  of  data  from  subSaharan Africa. 5 Because C. botulinum spores are ubiquitous in the environment, it is presumed that cases occur globally, although rates may vary with dietary customs and food handling practices.

Food-Borne Botulism
Food-borne botulism is caused by consumption of food contaminated with pre-formed botulinum toxin. It is usually associated with uncooked food products, as heating food to > 85°C for more than 5 minutes inactivates toxin. Although botulinum spores may potentially contaminate many foodstuffs, germination and toxin production only occur when spores are incubated in an anaerobic, low-salt milieu at greater than 4°C. The processes of canning and fermentation  of  foods  are  particularly  conducive  to  producing such conditions. Although effective methods of inactivating spores were introduced in the early 20th century, outbreaks of food-borne botulism attributable to commercially canned foods still account for  a  substantial  proportion  of  cases  in  Eastern  Europe,  and  a recent outbreak has been reported in the United States. 6  Homecanned foods remain a major source of intoxication, and food-borne botulism occurs with high incidence in areas where home preservation of food is popular, such as Eastern Europe and the Southern United States. 7 Several outbreaks in prisons due to illicit alcoholic brew containing fermented vegetables have recently been reported. 8 There is an exceptionally high incidence of food-borne botulism in Alaska and some areas of Canada attributable to the consumption of fermented aquatic mammal meat. 9

============================================================
Wound Botulism
Wound  botulism  follows  the  absorption  of  toxin  produced  by organisms  contaminating  a  wound  site,  so  clinical  incubation periods are longer than for botulism caused by food, which contains pre-formed toxin. Cases have increased in developed countries in recent years, driven by an epidemic among injecting drug users and  strongly  associated  with  the  practice  of  injecting  into  the subcutaneous tissues or muscle, known as skin or muscle popping . 10 Sporadic cases of botulism associated with contaminated compound fractures are occasionally reported.

============================================================
CHUNK 8
============================================================
Infant Botulism
Infant botulism is caused by the endogenous production of toxin by C. botulinum that has colonized the infant gastrointestinal tract after the germination of ingested spores. 11 Since its {rst description in 1976, infant botulism has been reported in all continents except Africa. Globally, most reported cases occur in the United States, where between 1976 and 2010, 2803 cases were reported. 12 Ingestion of honey, which is often contaminated by C. botulinum spores, was implicated in some cases, but in the majority a de{nitive source corn syrups have also been implicated, but again with no cases de{nitively attributed to this exposure. In the absence of a de{nitive source, acquisition is presumed to occur via ingestion of spores adherent to dust particles.

============================================================
Adult Intestinal Toxemia Botulism
Botulism  in  adults  resulting  from  in  vivo  toxin  production  by Clostridia colonizing the gastrointestinal tract was {rst demonstrated in the 1980s. In the few cases described, there is often a preceding history  of  gastrointestinal  surgery,  in|ammatory bowel disease, or antimicrobial use that presumably disrupts the normal microbial |ora, allowing colonization by Clostridia species. 13

============================================================
CLINICAL FEATURES
The clinical presentation of all forms of botulism is dominated by neurologic features resulting from the toxin-induced blockade of voluntary motor and autonomic cholinergic junctions. Symptoms usually appear between 1 and 5 days after ingestion of the toxin, although  very  high  doses  may  present  within  a  few  hours  and progress almost immediately to respiratory paralysis.
In  adults,  cranial  nerve  palsies  are  almost  always  the  initial presenting symptoms. Extraocular muscle paresis results in blurred or double vision. Marked ptosis is usually evident, and pupillary responses may also be depressed. The face may appear expressionless as a consequence of bilateral facial nerve dysfunction. Involvement of lower cranial nerves causes dysphonia, dysarthria, and dysphagia. Early autonomic involvement causes anhidrosis, leading affected individuals to complain of extremely dry and often painful, mouth, tongue, and throat.
Disease progression manifests as a symmetric, |accid, descending paralysis of voluntary muscles associated with loss of deep tendon re|exes.  Involvement  of  the  diaphragm  and  accessory  thoracic muscles may result in respiratory compromise and death unless supportive care is provided. Due to the generalized lack of motor function, respiratory failure often occurs without apparent features of respiratory distress and may be overlooked until very advanced. Signi{cant pharyngeal muscle weakness causing airway compromise may necessitate intubation and ventilation even in the absence of respiratory muscle weakness. Progressive autonomic involvement leads to constipation,  urinary  retention,  and  hemodynamic dysregulation.
Fever is usually absent, except in some cases of wound botulism, when it probably indicates concurrent wound infection with other bacteria.  Sensory  nerves  are  unaffected  by  botulinum  toxin. Similarly, there is no effect on level of consciousness or cognitive function, although the features of expressionless facies and dysarthria are often mistaken for alcohol or drug intoxication.

============================================================
CHUNK 11
============================================================
CLINICAL FEATURES
The extent, severity, and rate of progression of clinical features vary, and not all untreated cases progress to respiratory muscle paralysis.  Some  affected  individuals  only  develop  cranial  nerve palsies that gradually resolve without any other features of botulism becoming evident. Botulinum toxin binding is irreversible, and recovery  of  function  depends  on  nerve  terminal  regeneration. Individuals with respiratory compromise typically require ventilatory support for 2 to 8 weeks, although occasionally recovery is much more protracted.  Fatigue  and  generalized  weakness  may persist for many months after recovery, particularly in older patients and those who have been mechanically ventilated. 14
In food-borne disease, the neurologic features of botulism may be preceded by abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Such gastrointestinal disturbance has not been reported in wound botulism and probably represents the effect of other bacteria and their toxins co-contaminating the causative improperly preserved food. Clinical effects of botulinum toxin usually become evident 18 to 36 hours after consumption of the implicated foodstuff.

PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
In  the  context  of  a  large  outbreak,  in  which  multiple  patients present with combinations of cranial nerve palsies and subsequent development  of  descending  |accid  paralysis,  botulism  is  easily recognizable. However, it is a rare condition, and the majority of cases occur singularly, meaning that the diagnosis is often delayed or missed altogether.
Botulism should be suspected in any adult  with acute-onset gastrointestinal,  autonomic, and cranial nerve dysfunction. The four 'Ds' are the key clues: dysphonia, dysphagia, dysarthria, and descending  paralysis.  Demonstration  of  bilateral  cranial  nerve {ndings and evidence of neurologic progression increase the level or similar  illness  in  family  members  or  close  contacts  provides further supporting evidence for the diagnosis. Alternatively, features of injecting drug use are highly suggestive.
Important differential diagnoses to consider when botulism is suspected include alcohol or drug misuse, Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS),  myasthenia  gravis,  stroke  syndromes,  Eaton-Lambert syndrome, and tick paralysis. T able 60.1 includes other differential diagnoses with important distinguishing features.
GBS typically presents as an ascending paralysis, and there is often  a  history  of  antecedent  infection,  typically Campylobacter jejuni gastroenteritis. Distinguishing botulism from the triad of ophthalmoplegia,  ataxia,  and  are|exia  that  characterizes  the Miller-Fisher variant is often more dif{cult. However, in contrast to botulism, are|exia typically precedes the onset of signi{cant muscle weakness in GBS. Fatigable muscle weakness is the hallmark of myasthenia gravis. A marked improvement with administration of edrophonium is highly suggestive of myasthenia gravis, although about 25% of patients with botulism show some response. Patients with Eaton-Lambert syndrome usually have clinically apparent lung cancer, although electromyographic {ndings are indistinguishable from botulism. The asymmetric weakness and upper motor neuron signs caused by most stroke syndromes should be readily distinguishable from botulism on clinical examination. Tick paralysis causes paresthesia and ascending paralysis; the diagnosis is particularly apparent if the tick is still attached.

PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Cerebrospinal |uid analysis may be useful; protein levels are normal in botulism, compared with GBS where they are typically raised, although this may not be apparent until several days after symptom onset. Electromyography (EMG) may also be helpful. In  particular,  repetitive  stimulation  at  high  frequencies  shows facilitation  of  muscle  action  potentials  in  botulism  that  is  not evident in either GBS or myasthenia gravis. EMG is best performed and interpreted by an experienced operator, because results may vary among muscle groups. T o avoid false-negative results, it is essential that clinically affected muscle groups are tested.

De{nitive  laboratory  con{rmation  of  botulism  requires  the demonstration  of  toxin  in  specimens  of  patient  serum,  gastric secretions or stool or, in the case of food-borne botulism, a food sample. The standard method for determining botulinum toxin

is  the  mouse  lethality bioassay,  in  which mice are  observed  for the presence of botulism-speci{c symptoms after intraperitoneal injection  of  extracts  of  clinical  specimens.  However,  sensitivity and speci{city are not optimal: in one recent series of injecting drug users ful{lling a strict clinical diagnosis of wound botulism, the  mouse  bioassay  was  positive  in  only  68%. 15 Because  it  is performed in a limited number of laboratories and results may not be available for up to 4 days, it cannot be used as a basis for clinical management decisions. Several rapid in vitro assays that take  advantage  of  the  unique  endopeptidase  activity  of  each neurotoxin subtype have recently been developed and are currently undergoing clinical evaluation. The Endopep-MS assay that uses mass spectrometry to detect peptides cleaved by botulinum toxin reportedly has comparable sensitivity to the mouse lethality bioassay and  is  completed  within  8  hours. 16 Presumptive  diagnosis  of botulism can also be made by testing food or gastric contents for sensitive and rapid than conventional systems.

TREATMENT
The core principles of botulism management are the early administration of antitoxin and the prompt recognition of respiratory compromise, allowing the timely implementation of ventilatory support. Having been as high as 70%, the current mortality rate from botulism is less than 5% when adequate intensive care is available.
Most antitoxin preparations contain combinations of equinederived  antibodies  directed  against  speci{c  botulinum  toxin serotypes. A heptavalent botulinum antitoxin (H-BAT) that contains equine-derived antibody to the seven known botulinum toxin types intact  immunoglobulin,  H-BAT  is predominantly  composed of Fab  and  F(ab')2  immunoglobulin  fragments. 17 equine Fc fragments signi{cantly reduces the risk of anaphylaxis and serum sickness that complicated use of earlier formulations of  antitoxin.  F(ab') 2 fragments  derived  from  sheep  plasma  that have reportedly an even lower risk of toxicity have also been used in the UK and Southeast Asia. The only antitoxin preparation for which  there  is  prospective  comparative  trial-based  evidence  of effectiveness  is  the  use  of  human-derived  botulinum  immune globulin  for  the  treatment  of  infant  botulism. 3 An  alternative approach to producing well-tolerated botulinum antitoxin currently in development is germline humanization of antibodies derived from humans or non-human primates. 18
Systemic  administration  of  antitoxin  neutralizes  botulinum toxin that is not yet bound to nerve terminals  and thus arrests further disease progression. In a retrospective series of food-borne botulism, its early use is associated with a reduction in mortality and  shortening  of  the  duration  of  respiratory  failure  requiring ventilatory support. The use of Fab fragments allows the antiserum to reach the extravascular space more effectively and rapidly than whole antibodies.
The use of antitoxin is indicated on the basis of clinical suspicion of botulism, and treatment should not be delayed while waiting for the results of laboratory investigations. Botulinum antitoxins are generally given by slow intravenous infusion. Vital signs should be monitored carefully during administration, and medication for the  management  of  acute  allergic  reactions  should  be  readily available. Some national guidelines recommend repeat treatment within 24 hours if the patient continues to deteriorate.

============================================================
CHUNK 17
============================================================
TREATMENT
All  patients  with  botulism  should  be  managed  in  a  highdependency  setting  to  facilitate  close  monitoring.  Ventilatory support  should  be  promptly  instituted  upon  development  of respiratory compromise, indicated by diminishing vital capacity; up to 50% of patients with food-borne botulism require ventilatory support. Meticulous attention should be paid to the prevention and early treatment of nosocomial infection and to the maintenance of adequate nutritional status. Attendants should remember that, unlike many patients on ventilatory support, patients with botulism are  fully  awake  and  have  no  sensory  de{cits,  unless  they  have speci{cally received sedation.
In wound botulism, appropriate management of the wound is also  essential  in  order  to  prevent  relapse  due  to  ongoing  toxin production by persisting vegetative organisms after antitoxin has been  cleared  from  the  body.  All  wounds  should  be  surgically debrided  and  treated  with  antibiotics  until  completely  healed. of deep-seated abscesses should be always considered.
Upon suspicion  of  a  diagnosis  of  botulism  the  local  public health authorities should be contacted immediately. Investigations should be undertaken to rapidly identify other possible cases and suspected  food  exposures,  as  rapid  control  measures  such  as impounding  home-canned  foods  or  emergency  product  recalls may need to be instigated.
There  is  currently  no  licensed  prophylactic  vaccine  against botulism. A pentavalent botulinum toxoid vaccine previously used by the U.S. military was withdrawn in 2011 after the observation of  declining  immunogenicity.  A  recombinant  bivalent  vaccine against subtypes A and B entered phase II studies several years ago, but further development is awaited. 19

Clinical Features
Constipation is usually the {rst manifestation of infant botulism. -tions with a weakened cry, diminished feeding, and an increasingly '|oppy' infant as descending paresis occurs. Examination reveals hypotonia, loss of facial expression, extraocular muscle weakness, and dilated pupils. The extent and severity of clinical features is highly  variable,  ranging  from  mild  hypotonia  to  severe  |accid paralysis. Up to 70% of patients require intubation and ventilation, although mortality rates are < 1%.

CHUNK 19
============================================================
Treatment
Historically, equine-derived antitoxin has not been used to treat infant botulism because of concerns regarding serious hypersensitivity reactions and an inadequate duration of therapeutic effect. A human-derived antitoxin product, known as BabyBIG, has  been recently developed. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated that when administered early in the disease course, it signi{cantly reduces the duration of mechanical ventilation and length of hospital stay. 3
