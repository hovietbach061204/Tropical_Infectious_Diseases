- dangerous causes of viral hemorrhagic fever-an acute severe systemic illness that may rapidly evolve to severe multi-organ systemic disease, with a propensity for bleeding and shock.
- Africa, where bats are thought to be the natural reservoir.
- inadvertent exposure of mucous membranes or broken skin to infected excreta, blood, and other body |uids.
- the pathobiologic hallmarks, with death often resulting from an intense in|ammatory process akin to septic shock.
- non-speci{c clinical manifestations of {lovirus disease make diagnosis on clinical grounds dif{cult, especially early in the course of disease. Thus rapid laboratory con{rmation is imperative.
- for viral hemorrhagic fevers are required when {lovirus disease is suspected.
- supportive, a number of promising experimental therapies and vaccines are under investigation.
- 'immunologically privileged' tissue compartments and associated |uids, rarely resulting in sexual transmission and recrudescent disease.

INTRODUCTION
Viral hemorrhagic fever classically refers to an acute severe systemic illness presenting with fever and non-speci{c initial signs and symptoms that rapidly evolves to severe multi-organ systemic disease, with a propensity for bleeding and shock. Although over 30 viruses from four taxonomic families have been linked with the syndrome, historically the most notorious are members of the Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus genera in the family Filoviridae (T able 37.4.1), so-named for their unique {lamentous shape (Latin Slo = 'thread'). Filoviruses are composed of a single negative-sense strand of RNA (19 KB) encapsulated in a lipid envelope. Seven {loviruses have been identi{ed that infect humans but not all cause disease. 1-3 As has been the custom, the viruses are named after the site of the {rst recognized cases, although this practice has now fallen out of favor. The present evidence base is generally insuf{cient to practically distinguish Ebola and Marburg virus disease syndromes. Thus here we generally discuss them together as '{lovirus disease,' pointing out differences where the evidence allows.
The relative  ease of  {lovirus transmission between humans, high mortality, potential for major public health impact, including public panic and economic disruption seen so graphically during the 2013-2016  outbreak of Ebola virus  disease in West Africa, require special action for public health preparedness. 4-6 In addition to the danger posed in endemic areas, {loviruses are among the agents  of  highest  concern  with  regard  to  potential  use  as  bioweapons. Consequently, for reasons of both biosafety and biosecurity, research on {loviruses is highly regulated, with live virus manipulation restricted to high containment laboratories. 2,3

*Although human exposure to Reston virus has been documented through antibody studies, no disease has been noted. The virus does not appear to be a human pathogen, although it is highly pathogenic in non-human primates.

aegyptiacus ), including from caves and mines associated with human cases of Marburg virus disease. In contrast, ebolaviruses have yet to be isolated from a bat, although viral RNA and anti-ebolavirus immunoglobulin G (IgG) have been detected in a number of bat species. Evidence of ebolavirus infection has been noted in other wild animals, especially non-human primates, such as monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees, presumably through exposure to bats, but these animals are thought to be dead-end hosts, developing severe disease similar to that seen in humans and playing no role in natural virus maintenance. Animals sick with {lovirus infection may  be  easier  prey  for  hunters.  Reston  virus,  which  does  not appear to be pathogenic to humans, has been isolated from pigs in the Philippines, which were presumably infected from exposure to bats. 2,3
Both primary infection from animals and secondary infection between humans are thought to  be through direct and usually inadvertent  exposure  of  mucous  membranes  or  broken  skin  to infected excreta, blood, and other body |uids. The infectious dose appears  to  be  low,  perhaps  on  the  order  of  just  a  few  virions. Infection through fomites cannot be excluded. There is no evidence of aerosol transmission between humans, although transmission and disease via arti{cial aerosol generation have been shown in non-human primates, with implications for potential use as bioweapons. Because {loviruses are relatively unstable in the environment and are rapidly inactivated by heating, consumption of cooked or smoked animal meat poses little risk. Rather, infection likely occurs during hunting and butchering. 2,3

============================================================
Human-to-Human Transmission
Human-to-human infection occurs most often in the context of providing care to a sick family member (community transmission) or  patient  (nosocomial  transmission),  as  well  as  during  funeral rituals that entail direct exposure to the corpse. 2,3 Despite high infectivity, secondary attack rates for {loviruses are generally low, probably because transmission between humans requires direct contact  with  contaminated  blood  or  body  |uids.  During  the 2013-2016 West Africa Ebola virus disease outbreak, in households with an acutely infected person, the attack rate was less than 1% for persons not providing patient care, rising to 22.9% for those with direct patient contact and 47.9% for those providing direct care, and 83% for persons in direct contact with corpses. 5,7 The outbreak  served  as  a  poignant  illustration  of  how  the  risk  of transmission can increase signi{cantly when patient loads overwhelm fragile health systems and infection prevention and control measures break  down, often  pressing insuf{ciently  trained  and equipped health care workers into service. In some cases, highly infectious  'super  spreaders'  have  been  suspected. 4,6 Despite modern-day travel, imported cases of {loviral fever remain rare and usually  do  not result in secondary transmission due to the more  routinely  maintained  infection  prevention  and  control practices in resource-rich countries. 3
Infectivity parallels the clinical state, with risk of transmission low in the {rst few days of febrile symptoms but rising drastically as the disease progresses in severity and patients with high viral loads shed virus into the environment through vomiting, diarrhea, and when bleeding. 2,3 The risk of transmission during the incubation period or from asymptomatic or recovered persons is negligible, with  the  exception  of  sexual  transmission  related  to  {lovirus persistence in the semen of male survivors (see later).

Human-to-Human Transmission
Although a few apparently non-pathogenic {loviruses appear to  circulate  outside  Africa,  all  the  pathogenic  viruses  and  all recognized outbreaks to date have originated in sub-Saharan Africa (Fig. 37.4.1). Marburg virus was {rst isolated and named after an outbreak in West Germany and Yugoslavia in 1967 in workers harvesting tissues for vaccine production from monkeys imported from Uganda. Discovery of two Ebolaviruses followed in 1976, with outbreaks in Zaire (present-day Democratic Republic of the Congo) and Sudan. Periodic outbreaks continue to this day, with apparently  increasing  frequency  (T able  37.4.2). 2,3 Whether this re|ects a true increase in events, perhaps due to climatic factors in|uencing the abundance or proportion of infected bats or other unknown spillover reservoirs, changing human behaviors resulting in increased exposure to infected animals, enhanced surveillance and  detection,  or  a  combination  of  all  three  factors  remains unknown. Whereas once considered an 'exotic disease' posing limited risk albeit with devastating consequences, only to small numbers  of  people  in  remote  African  villages,  the  2013-2016 outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa with a reported 28,616 cases and 11,310 deaths, including over 500 health workers, imported cases to the United States and Europe, and billions of dollars  of  economic  loss,  awoke  the  world  to  the  potential  for {lovirus outbreaks to cause complex humanitarian crises and major global health threats. 4-6

NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
Microvascular instability and impaired hemostasis are the pathobiologic hallmarks of all viral hemorrhagic fevers, but much work remains to understand the precise pathogenetic mechanisms of disease and death. Severe disease is clearly associated with high levels  of  virus  in  blood  and  tissues,  aided  by  {lovirus-directed suppression of innate and adaptive immune responses. Most fatal cases die with high viral loads, having failed to mount a signi{cant antibody response. By comparison, infectious virus is cleared rapidly from the blood in survivors. 2,3,8
After  inoculation,  the  virus  {rst  replicates  in  dendritic  cells and macrophages in local tissues. Whereas infected macrophages produce  in|ammatory  cytokines,  infected  dendritic  cells  are dysfunctional  in  their  ability  to  present  viral  antigens  and  costimulate T cells. Infected cells migrate to regional lymph nodes, and the virus is then disseminated through the lymph and blood monocytes to a broad range of tissues and organs, including the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, adrenal glands, lungs, and endothelium. Migration of tissue  macrophages results in secondary infection of permissive parenchymal cells. 2,3,8
The interaction of virus with immune cells, especially macrophages and endothelial cells, results directly or indirectly (through soluble  mediators)  in  cell  activation  and  the  unleashing  of  an in|ammatory and vasoactive process in a 'cytokine storm' consistent with the systemic in|ammatory response syndrome. The synthesis of  cell  surface  tissue  factor  triggers  the  extrinsic  coagulation pathway. Impaired hemostasis may entail endothelial cell, platelet, or coagulation factor dysfunction. Macrophages over-express tissue factor, which is thought to contribute to vascular impairment and the  frequently  noted  disseminated  intravascular  coagulation. In|ammatory cell in{ltrates, which are usually mild, consist of a mix of mononuclear cells and neutrophils. In ebolavirus infection, replication  and  dissemination  are  facilitated  by  virus-induced suppression of the host adaptive immune response. 2,3,8

CHUNK 9
============================================================
NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
Tissue damage may be mediated through necrosis of infected cells or indirectly through apoptosis of immune cells, as seen in other forms of septic shock, and by immunopathology associated with dysregulated cellular immune responses. Precise mechanisms of death from {lovirus disease are not well understood but are thought  to  stem  from  multi-organ  system  dysfunction  due  to ineffective  circulatory  volume  due  to  capillary  instability,  compounded by volume loss from vomiting, diarrhea, and, less frequently,  bleeding.  Death  from  involvement  and  dysfunction  of speci{c organs, including the liver, spleen, brain, kidney, thymus, and adrenal gland, may occur in some cases. Hepatocellular necrosis is  often widespread and thought to play a major role. Inclusion bodies are often visible in intact cells. 2,3,8,9

============================================================
CLINICAL FEATURES
Filovirus disease is seen in both  sexes and  over all age groups, with a spectrum from relatively mild or even asymptomatic infection to  severe  vascular  permeability  resulting  in  shock,  multi-organ system  failure,  and  death.  After  a  typical  incubation  period  of about 7 days (range 2-21), patients typically present with nonspeci{c signs and symptoms dif{cult to distinguish from a host of  other  febrile  illnesses.  These  include  fever,  general  malaise, anorexia, headache, chest or retrosternal pain, sore throat, myalgia, arthralgia, and lumbosacral pain. Conjunctival injection or hemorrhage may be present but is not accompanied by itching, discharge, or rhinitis, which should suggest another diagnosis (Fig. 37.4.2). Other forms of hemorrhage are almost never present in the {rst few days of illness. Hiccups are occasionally noted and may be a more speci{c but  poorly sensitive indicator of {lovirus disease. Although seen  in  less  than  10%  of  patients,  a  morbilliform  or maculopapular  facial  or truncal  rash,  often  |eeting,  may  be  an early and relatively speci{c indicator of {lovirus disease. A dry cough, sometimes accompanied by a few scattered rales on auscultation, is common, but prominent pulmonary symptoms are uncommon early  in  the  course  of  the  disease.  Jaundice  is  not  typical except in patients with underlying Gilbert syndrome, drug reactions, or coinfection. 2,3,10
After  the  {rst  few  days,  gastrointestinal  signs  and  symptoms readily ensue, including nausea, vomiting, epigastric and  abdominal  pain,  abdominal  tenderness,  and  non-bloody diarrhea  or  constipation.  Gastrointestinal  |uid  losses  may  lead to  severe  volume  depletion  and  electrolyte  abnormalities;  in the  West  Africa  Ebola  virus  disease  outbreak,  patients  often required up to 5 liters of oral or intravenous |uid replacement daily.  A  misdiagnosis  of  appendicitis  or  other  acute  abdominal emergency  sometimes  prompts  potentially  hazardous  surgical interventions. 2,3,10

============================================================
CHUNK 26
============================================================
CLINICAL FEATURES
In severe cases, patients progress after 7 to 10 days of illness to vascular instability, which may be manifested by conjunctival injection and hemorrhage, facial |ushing, edema, bleeding, hypotension, shock, and proteinuria. Hemorrhage may be manifested as hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, metrorrhagia, petechiae, purpura, epistaxis, and bleeding from the gums and venipuncture sites (see Fig. 37.4.2). Hemoptysis and hematuria are infrequent. Acute renal insuf{ciency or failure is common. Central nervous system manifestations, including delirium, tremor, gait anomalies, convulsions,  and  hiccups,  may  be  noted  in  the  second  to  third week of illness and in end-stage disease. Cerebrospinal |uid (CSF) examination is uncommonly performed in these settings; however, ebolavirus RNA has been detected in the CSF of acutely ill patients with meningoencephalitis syndromes. 2,3,10
Although most pregnant women infected with {loviruses present with  severe  disease,  including  spontaneous  abortion  and  vaginal bleeding, atypical presentations were occasionally noted during the West Africa Ebola virus outbreak. These included mild and even afebrile presentations that may nevertheless progress to severe and fatal disease. It is hypothesized that in these cases the immune tolerance of pregnancy dampens the initial in|ammatory clinical manifestations. How frequently this occurs is unknown, although anecdotal reports exist of similar atypical presentations, with obvious challenging implications for case identi{cation and implementation of proper infection prevention and control, especially when emergency invasive obstetric procedures are indicated during an outbreak. 3,11

============================================================
CHUNK 27
============================================================
PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The nonspeci{c early presentation of {lovirus disease makes clinical diagnosis  extremely dif{cult,  especially  outside  the  setting  of  a recognized outbreak, which is usually detected when clusters of cases occur, especially when they involve health care workers. A
complete epidemiologic history (including details of travel, possible exposures,  and  occupational  risks),  details  of  disease  evolution, physical examination, and preliminary basic laboratory results are critical. 2,3,8 The diagnosis of {loviral fever should be considered in patients with a clinically compatible syndrome who within the last 21 days:
- is ongoing
- who was ill with acute {lovirus disease, including health care workers, persons caring for family members at home or preparing bodies for burial, and laboratory personnel
- non-human primates) in or recently arriving from an area where {lovirus disease is endemic (although direct contact with the animal reservoir is not usually reported even in con{rmed cases)
- handled
- fever in the previous eighteen months.

============================================================
CHUNK 28
============================================================
Diagnosis
Because {lovirus disease is often extremely dif{cult to de{nitively diagnose  on  clinical  grounds,  prompt  laboratory  con{rmation is  imperative.  Reverse  transcription  polymerase  chain  reaction (RT-PCR) testing for {lovirus RNA has become the test of choice because, once samples are inactivated, it can be performed outside of the high containment laboratory, with reagents that are generally commercially available and with {eld-deployable platforms providing results within hours. Blood and serum are the preferred samples. Sensitivity and speci{city of a variety of available RT-PCR assays are generally considered to be over 90%, though extensive evaluation of speci{c {eld testing characteristics is needed. 12,13 False-negative results may occur in patients very early in the course of the disease when virus levels may still be below the threshold of detection, although this can be overcome with highly sensitive assays. In a patient in whom RT-PCR results are negative but for whom {lovirus disease is still highly suspected, the patient should be monitored, treated empirically as needed, and retested a few days later when the viral load would normally have risen to a detectable level. Enzymelinked immunosorbent assays for viral antigen and IgM and IgG, virus culture, and immunohistochemistry on postmortem tissues are  also  variably  applied  for  laboratory  diagnosis. These  assays generally appear to have sensitivities and speci{cities above 90%. 12,13 Various rapid diagnostic tests have been developed but not fully {eld-evaluated, leaving questions about sensitivity and speci{city depending on sample type. Concerns over the rami{cations of both false-positive and -negative results have led to considerable reticence to embrace their use, and their place in surveillance and outbreak response remains to be de{ned. In the United States {loviral fever testing can be arranged through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (phone: 470-312-0094, email: spather@cdc.gov). All con{rmed cases should be immediately reported to local, state, and federal health authorities.

============================================================
CHUNK 29
============================================================
Differential Diagnosis
Filovirus disease is rare even in persons demonstrating the risk factors  cited  earlier,  so  alternative  diagnoses  should  always  be aggressively sought. The differential diagnosis includes a broad array of febrile illnesses that varies by geographic region, including malaria, typhoid fever, shigellosis, other viral hemorrhagic fevers, fulminant  viral  hepatitis,  rickettsial  disease,  leptospirosis,  and meningococcal septicemia. It is important to recognize that coinfections, especially with malaria, may be common and may affect disease severity. Acts of bioterrorism must be considered if {loviral
fever is strongly suspected in a patient without any of the aforementioned risk  factors,  especially  if  clusters  of  cases  occur. All cases should be immediately reported to local, state, and federal health authorities. 2

============================================================
CHUNK 30
============================================================
Supportive Care
Patients should be placed in isolation in an intensive care unit where close monitoring and critical supportive care can be provided. Evidence-based consensus guidelines for supportive care for Ebola virus disease have recently been published and include the use of oral and parenteral rehydration, analgesics, and empiric antibiotics; systematic monitoring of |uid and electrolyte status; staff-to-patient ratios; and patient communication with family and friends. 14 In African settings, either speci{c malarial testing or empiric antimalarial treatment should be employed. These approaches should be followed for Marburg virus disease as well. Most patients can be supported with oxygen administered by nasal cannula or face mask, although mechanical ventilation may be required in severe cases.  Renal  replacement  therapy  has  been  used  in  a  few  cases safely and with apparent success. 15 Blood products should not be given empirically but only to meet de{ned clinical and laboratory parameters in the face of clinically signi{cant hemorrhage, taking into  consideration  the  possibility  of  disseminated  intravascular coagulation.  Given  the  extremely  high  maternal  and  fetal  case fatality  associated  with  {lovirus  disease  in  pregnancy,  uterine evacuation may be considered. However, this procedure must be performed  with  extreme  caution  because  it  can  be  considered high risk with regard to potential nosocomial transmission. 2,3,10

============================================================
CHUNK 31
============================================================
Anti-Viral Therapy
A number of experimental antiviral drugs have shown promise in animal models and, to a limited degree, in human clinical trials of Ebola virus disease (T able 37.4.3). 3,10,16 At the time of this writing, a randomized clinical trial of four Ebola virus-speci{c therapeutics (the antiviral remdesivir and the monoclonal antibody formulations ZMapp, REGN, and mAb114) is being undertaken in an Ebola virus disease outbreak in the northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. In addition, the World Health Organization has led the development of the Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered  and  Investigational  Interventions  (MEURI)  protocol  to gather clinical data and provide ethical guidelines for the compassionate use of experimental compounds for Ebola virus disease in settings where a clinical trial cannot be implemented. 17 Hundreds of  patients  were  treated  under  the  MEURI  protocol  while the clinical trial was being set up.
Considerably less study has been devoted to therapeutics for Marburg  virus  disease;  while  promising  countermeasures  have been identi{ed in non-human primates, ef{cacy and safety data do not exist.

============================================================
CHUNK 32
============================================================
Discharge and Monitoring
Because the patient's clinical status and infectivity correlate with the level of viremia, recovered patients can safely be assumed to have cleared the virus and can be discharged from the hospital without concern of subsequent transmission, with the exception of the risk of sexual transmission (see later). Although undoubtedly a valuable tool, the routine use of PCR has created some confusion here 18 ; despite the lack of evidence, a requirement for patients to test PCR negative in blood, and sometimes urine, before discharge has  become  the  norm. The  absence  of  standardization  of  {eld PCR assays, as well as of direct evidence associating detectable RNA  levels  (usually  measured  by  PCR  cycle  threshold)  with infectious  virus  requires  some  caution  in  interpretation.  In  the worst cases, clinically  recovered patients have been con{ned in isolation units for prolonged periods waiting for very low levels of RNA to {nally clear, with potential detrimental effects with regard to both risk of secondary nosocomial infections and mental health. In the many years of clinical management of patients with {lovirus  disease  before  PCR  or  other  laboratory  testing  were routinely available in the {eld, patients were simply discharged when clinically  recovered  with  no  reported  cases  of  secondary transmission, with the exception of rare instances of sexual transmission and potential transmission to infants through breast milk in women infected during pregnancy. Even in these unusual cases, however,  a  negative  blood  PCR  would  not  have  detected  or prevented this event. 19

============================================================
CHUNK 33
============================================================
Prognosis
Death from {loviral disease usually occurs within 10 days after the onset of illness. Common indicators of a poor prognosis include shock, bleeding, neurologic manifestations, high viremia (or surrogate measurements of antigen or genome copies), renal dysfunction  (elevated  serum  creatinine),  elevated  levels  of  aspartate aminotransferase ( > 150 IU/L), and pregnancy, especially during the third trimester, in which maternal and fetal mortality may be above  90%.  However,  mild and  even  asymptomatic  cases  have been reported. Reasons for this heterogeneity are largely unknown, although differences in route and dose of infection, underlying comorbid  illness,  and  host  genetic  predisposition  have  been postulated. 3,10
Although more investigation is needed into the precise pathogenesis of fatal disease, most deaths are thought to result from a process akin to septic shock, when insuf{cient effective circulating intravascular volume leads to hypotension, cellular dysfunction, and multi-organ system failure. Meningoencephalitis (with evidence of microvesicular occlusion and ischemia on magnetic resonance imaging), renal and respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and cardiac arrhythmias have also been reported and inferred as the cause of death in some patients, but it is not clear whether these re|ect organ-speci{c pathogenesis or are secondary to electrolyte disturbances or systemic in|ammatory response syndrome. Another possible  cause  of  sudden  death  may  be  thrombotic  cardiac  or cerebrovascular accidents related to thrombocytosis and a hypercoaguable state that have been documented in early recovery from Ebola virus disease. 3,9,10

Prognosis
During the West Africa Ebola virus disease outbreak, the case fatality rate in the 27 patients who received care in the United States and Europe was only 18.5% compared with 31% to 76% reported from West Africa. 3,5,15 It  is  unknown whether this discrepancy relates to the use of experimental therapies (of which 85% of patients in high-resource settings received one or more but not in any controlled fashion allowing determination of safety or  ef{cacy),  better  |uid  and  electrolyte  monitoring  and  organ support (including mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy), genetic predisposition, and/or diminished co-morbidities relative to the West African population.

Sequelae
Observations  from  prior  {lovirus  disease  outbreaks,  recently augmented from the thousands of survivors in West Africa, make it  clear  that  convalescence from Ebola virus disease is dif{cult and  prolonged,  with  frequent  and  potentially  severe  sequelae lasting up to a year or more. Persistent arthralgia, extreme fatigue, ocular  complications  (including  potentially  sight-threatening uveitis that  may result in  early  cataract  formation),  headaches, abdominal pain, and anorexia are very frequent. Less common but  reported  sequelae  include  neurologic  de{cits  and  hearing loss.  Mental health sequelae include sleep and memory disturbances, anxiety disorders, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder,

and 'survivors' guilt' in not only survivors but also other family and community members. Characterization of the clinical phenotype, as well as the pathogenesis of these sequelae of {lovirus disease, is being studied. 2,3,10,20
The management of sequelae is generally supportive, with the exception of uveitis, for which timely diagnosis and urgent treatment with topical or oral corticosteroids  and atropine may be sight  saving.  The  World  Health  Organization  has  developed clinical  care  guidelines  for  management  of  survivors  of  Ebola virus disease. 20

============================================================
Virus Persistence and Recrudescence
Limited data from prior {lovirus outbreaks complemented by the large number of survivors from the West Africa Ebola virus outbreak shed light on the potential for {loviruses to persist for months or even years in certain 'immunologically privileged' tissue compartments and associated |uids, including the semen of male survivors; aqueous humor of the eye; cerebrospinal |uid of the central nervous system; and the fetus, placenta, and amniotic sac/|uid of women infected during pregnancy. Ebola virus RNA has frequently been detected
in the semen of male survivors during the {rst 3 to 6 months after recovery  and  in  a  few  men  for  more  than  2  years  after  acute disease. 3,10,20,21 The risks of sexual transmission around this persistence are yet to be characterized and appear to be extremely rare; however, male-to-female sexual transmission events associated with re-ignition of outbreaks have been clearly documented, with one outlier event occurring more than 400 days after acute disease. 22
A few cases have been noted in which women infected during pregnancy recovered and remained pregnant, only to spontaneously abort a macerated and non-viable fetus in subsequent weeks or months. Ebola virus RNA was found in the products of conception, although con{rming the presence of infectious virus by cell culture was generally not logistically possible. 3,10,11,20 Although no secondary transmission has been reported from these cases, proper infection prevention and control precautions should be taken when attending all  births  to  women  who  were  infected  with  {loviruses  during pregnancy. There is no evidence of virus persistence or transmission risk  from  deliveries  of  women  who  conceived  after  recovering from Ebola virus disease. Virus persistence has also been documented in Marburg virus disease. 2

============================================================
CHUNK 41
============================================================
Virus Persistence and Recrudescence
Two cases  of  {lovirus  recrudescence  associated  with  organthreatening in|ammation have been noted in persons cared for in high-resource settings with prolonged virus persistence-uveitis at 14 weeks and meningoencephalitis with seizures at 9 months after  recovery,  respectively.  Ebola  virus  was  isolated  from  the anterior chamber |uid of the eye and the CSF but not the blood. No obvious underlying immunosuppressive condition or trigger for virus reactivation could be identi{ed in these cases, and both eventually cleared the virus and recovered. It remains unknown whether recrudescent disease has also occurred in Africa but escaped detection, or rather re|ects rare events following the seeding of immune-privileged  sites  at  high  viremia  during  severe  disease (true  for  both  cases)  that  would  likely  have  been  fatal  in  most African settings without intensive medical care. Anecdotal reports exist  of  recrudescent  disease  and  viremia  in  West  Africa,  in some cases thought to be related to underlying HIV infection, although this association remains unpublished and has not been validated. 3,10,20
Despite evidence of {lovirus persistence in these selected sites, the only evidence of transmission from a survivor to date is through male-to-female sexual transmission. Consequently, abstinence or safe sex with condoms is recommended until viral RNA clearance from the semen can be con{rmed through laboratory testing or, in  the absence of available testing, for at least  18  months after recovery. Breastfeeding should be avoided during convalescence unless there is no other way to support the baby. 20

============================================================
CHUNK 42
============================================================
Infection Prevention and Control
Normal  barrier  nursing  precautions  to  prevent  parenteral  and droplet  exposure  to  blood  and  body  |uids  suf{ce  to  prevent infection in most instances, at least early in the course of disease when viremia and virus shedding are low, and should provide a measure of security and comfort to clinicians working in general medicine settings  and  examining  returning  travelers.  However, these may break down when case counts overwhelm health systems, as seen in the West Africa Ebola virus disease outbreak. Once the diagnosis of {lovirus disease is suspected, the patient should be placed in isolation and speci{c viral hemorrhagic fever precautions implemented. Despite the absence of evidence of aerosol transmission, patients are usually placed in negative-air|ow rooms when available,  but  hermetically  sealed  isolation  chambers  are  not required. Access to the patient should be limited to a small number of designated staff and family members with speci{c instructions and training on infection control guidelines and the use of personal protective equipment, including surgical masks, face shields, double gloves,  gowns,  head  and  shoe  covers,  and  protective  aprons. Although the focus is often on the personal protective equipment, the other essential components of infection prevention and control should not be overlooked, including proper staff-to-patient ratios, waste disposal, and disinfection procedures. Small-particle aerosol precautions should be used when procedures are performed that may generate aerosols, such as endotracheal intubation. 2,6,23

============================================================
CHUNK 43
============================================================
Contact Tracing
The early non-speci{c presentation of patients with {lovirus disease poses  a serious challenge to effective epidemiologic surveillance. Fortunately,  the  low  secondary  attack  rates  afford  a  measure  of reassurance, even when cases go unrecognized, as long as proper barrier  nursing  is  maintained.  Furthermore,  because  mild  cases, which may be still more dif{cult to recognize, are usually not very infectious, missed or delayed diagnosis of these patients is unlikely to pose a problem from an infection control standpoint. 2,6,23
Contact tracing is recommended only for close contacts, de{ned as persons with unprotected direct contact with a patient during the symptomatic phase of {lovirus disease. This group should be monitored daily for evidence of disease for 21 days after their last contact, checking their temperature daily and recording the results in a log. It is prudent to avoid contact with household members that might result in exposure to body |uids, such as sex, kissing, and sharing of utensils for this time. Con{nement or laboratory testing of asymptomatic persons, even if close contacts, is not recommended.

============================================================
CHUNK 44
============================================================
Vaccines
Numerous {lovirus vaccines are under development. 3,10,24 A phase III trial of a recombinant, replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus-based  vaccine  expressing  a  surface  glycoprotein  of  Ebola virus  (rVSV-EBOV)  showed  100%  vaccine  ef{cacy  in  a  trial deploying a ring vaccination strategy conducted during the West Africa Ebola virus disease outbreak 25 and has recently been used under expanded access protocols during outbreaks in the Democratic  Republic of  the  Congo. Adverse effects are  frequent  but mostly minor; transient fever, arthritis, dermatitis, and vasculitis have been reported. Another promising approach, now in phase II clinical trials, is a chimpanzee adenovirus 26 (cAd26) vaccine encoding the surface glycoprotein of Ebola virus, followed by the modi{ed vaccinia Ankara (MVA)-a multi-valent, live, recombinant, replication-incompetent adjuvant expressing antigens of multiple ebolaviruses. Although head-to-head trials have not been conducted, these  vaccine  approaches  are  thought  to  have  complementary pro{les, with rVSV-EBOV conferring rapid immunity after a single dose and cAd26/MVA providing a longer duration of immunity.

CHUNK 45
============================================================
Post-Exposure Prophylaxis
Post-exposure prophylaxis should be considered only in persons with distinct high-risk exposure, de{ned as follows: (1) penetration of skin by a contaminated sharp instrument (e.g., needlestick injury); (2)  exposure  of  mucous  membranes  or  broken  skin  to  blood  or body secretions (e.g., blood splashing in the eyes or mouth); (3) participation in emergency procedures without appropriate personal protective equipment (e.g., resuscitation after cardiac arrest, intubation, or suctioning); and (4) prolonged (i.e., hours) and continuous contact in an enclosed space without appropriate personal protective equipment. Guidance on options for post-exposure prophylaxis-all experimental and with varied availability on a compassionate use basis-have recently been published. 26 Fewer prophylactic options are  available  for  Marburg  virus  disease,  although  AVI-7288,  an experimental phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer with positive charges that targets the viral messenger RNA that encodes Marburg virus nucleoprotein, has proven ef{cacious in infected non-human primates and is safe in humans.

============================================================
CHUNK 46
============================================================
Reservoir Control
Avoiding contact with bats, primarily by avoiding entry into caves and  mines  in  endemic  areas,  is  a  key  prevention  measure  for {loviruses. Personal protective equipment may be indicated for miners and other persons who work in these environments. Humans should also avoid exposure to fresh blood, body |uids, or meat of wild animals, especially bats and non-human primates.
