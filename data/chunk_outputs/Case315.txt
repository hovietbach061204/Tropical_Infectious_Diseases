INTRODUCTION
Protothecosis is a rare infection in humans caused by achlorophyllic algae belonging to the genus Prototheca . 1,2 Infections have involved skin, subcutaneous tissue, olecranon bursa, and lymph nodes or deep organs 3-7 ; meningitis and algeamia are reported in severely immunocompromised individuals. 8-10 More than 160 3-5 cases have been reported in the world literature from temperate and tropical areas  of  all  continents,  with  no  clear  geographic  distribution. 2 Veterinary infections occur in several species of animals; bovine mastitis  has  the  most  signi{cant  economic  and  public  health importance. 11,12

EPIDEMIOLOGY, NATURAL HISTORY, AND PATHOGENESIS
The index case of  protothecosis  in  humans  occurred  in  a  rice farmer from Sierra Leone (Fig. 84.1) and was caused by Prototheca zopSi . 13 With  few  exceptions,  most  other  infections  in  humans where the species was determined have been caused by P. wickerhamii. 2,5 P. zopSi and P. wickerhamii are ubiquitous achloric algae usually found in soil and contaminated water. Both are unicellular organisms with hyaline walls and asexual reproduction by internal cleavage, forming endospores. Prototheca are thought to be mutant strains  of  chlorophyllic  (green)  algae  that  lack  chloroplasts. 1,2 Infections  by  both  organisms  have  been  reported  in  animals. P. zopSi causes endemic bovine mastitis 2,11 ; other animal pathogens, P.  stagnora, and P.  blaschkeae, are  not  known  to  cause  disease  in humans. 2
Chlorella spp. are similar to Prototheca spp. in size and staining characteristics,  expect  for  the  presence  of  bright  green chloroplasts  and  periodic  acid-Schiff  (PAS)-positive  intracytoplasmic granules. 1,2 Although infections by Chlorella have been described

Protothecosis

Very little is known about the pathogenesis of protothecosis. Prior  trauma  often  precedes  localized  infections  in  immunocompetent individuals. Immunosuppression with defects in cellmediated immunity, as well as neutrophil and natural killer cell dysfunction, probably facilitate severe and systemic infection. 4,5,9 There has been an apparent rise in the number of infections in individuals with compromised immune systems. Endemic bovine mastitis is hard to treat and eradicate due to bio{lm formation by the algae. 12

CLINICAL FEATURES AND HISTOPATHOLOGY
Three clinical syndromes are associated with Prototheca infection. One is a localized  infection  of  the  olecranon  bursa  in  patients with normal immunity, usually secondary to trauma and contact with contaminated water  or soil. The second  is an eczematoid dermatitis/soft tissue infection in immunosuppressed individuals, 4-6 also  associated  with  trauma  and/or  contact  with  contaminated water and soil; others are iatrogenic from contaminated catheters, peritoneal  dialysis,  or  after  orthopedic  procedures.  The  third syndrome comprises involvement of internal organs or systemic infection  in  patients  with  severe  immune  suppression  (AIDS, chemotherapy, and post-transplantation). 5,7-10
Protothecosis of the olecranon bursa develops several weeks after injury to the elbow. The lesions are localized to the bursa, but  there  may  be  epithelial  hyperplasia  and  underlying  sinus tracts.  The  bursa  is  thickened,  and  histopathologic  changes include  areas  of  caseation  necrosis  surrounded  by  epithelioid cells,  Langerhans  giant  cells,  and  {brosis. Prototheca organisms are scattered throughout the areas of necrosis and in the wall of the granuloma.
Cutaneous and subcutaneous forms present as single or multiple lesions on the skin or within the subcutaneous tissue, usually over an exposed portion of the body, such as a limb or the face. The lesions are maculopapular to plaque-like and may have an overlying crust or focal ulceration; they spread slowly, often in a centrifugal pattern,  and  do  not  resolve. The  in|ammatory  response  varies from minimal to necrotizing granulomatous reaction and appears related to the depth of the invasion. The organisms may be in any  or  all  layers  of  the  skin  and  may  be  single  or  in  clusters, extra-cellular or within giant cells. These lesions must be differentiated from other chronic granulomatous diseases of the skin and soft tissue.
In disseminated infections, there is a mixed in{ltrate composed of  acute  and  chronic  in|ammatory  cells,  including  giant  cells; organisms  are  usually  abundant  in  the  exudate.  Some  patients with protothecosis may develop a mild tissue eosinophilia.

PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Scrapings  of  the  skin,  biopsy  specimens,  and  aspirates  can  be cultured on Sabouraud's or other fungal medium and require 1 to 2 days for growth. 2 T ypical sporulating forms are identi{ed on stained wet-mounts. P. zopSi cells (Fig. 84.2A and B) are spherical

to  ovoid,  7  to  32 μ m  in  diameter,  and  rarely  form  morulae. P.  wickerhamii cells  are  spherical,  2  to  15 μ m in  diameter,  and frequently  form  morulae  (Fig.  84.2C) . They  both  stain  with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), but are better seen with Gomori methenamine silver (GMS), PAS, and the Gridley fungus (GF) stains and therefore can be easily mistaken for fungi. Prototheca and Chlorella spp. are identi{ed in culture by the type of division, sugar assimilation tests, immunoassays, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time  of  |ight  (MALDI-TOF)  and,  for Chlorella, the presence of bright green chloroplasts. 2,15,16 In tissue, the algae have similar size and staining characteristics as several fungi  but  can  be  differentiated  based  on  cleavage,  absence  of budding, and/or formation of morulae.

TREATMENT
Simple surgical excision cures protothecosis of the olecranon bursa and small skin lesions. The cutaneous lesions in immunosuppressed patients resist treatment and may persist for several years, eventually spreading to other sites. T opical treatments used in the past were not effective; oral therapy with azoles is the treatment of choice in early cutaneous disease, but unresponsive, severe, and systemic infection requires intravenous amphotericin B. 17
