EPIDEMIOLOGY
Campylobacter infection is a zoonotic disease, observed in most parts of  the  world.  Animals  (fowl,  swine,  cattle,  sheep,  dogs,  cats  and rodents)  are  the  major  reservoir  for  the  bacteria  and  are  usually asymptomatic. Campylobacter enteritis has no seasonal preference in developing  countries  in  contrast  with  developed  countries,  where epidemics occur in summer and early autumn.
In higher-income countries, acquisition of organisms results from the handling or consumption of poultry in about 50% of cases. Other causes include the consumption of beef, pork, raw milk and contaminated  water,  and  contact  with  pets  and  farm  animals.  In  the  USA, surveillance studies showed a 30% decrease in incidence of cultureconfirmed Campylobacter infections  from  1996  to  2006,  with  an average of 13.9 cases per 100,000 in 2006. In New Zealand, incidence has  been  increasing  since  the  1980s,  with  almost  400  cases  per 100,000 persons in 2003. Europe reported 45 per 100,000 persons in 2005 and in Canada the rate in 2004 was 30 cases per 100,000. The variations in incidence between countries may be caused, in part, by differences in surveillance systems [1, 4].
In studies from resource-poor countries in Latin America and Africa, Campylobacter is  the  most  commonly  isolated  bacterial  pathogen among children with diarrhea. The incidence of Campylobacter enteritis among children younger than 5 years old in these areas is as high as  40,000/100,000. Although these rates seem extraordinarily high, they are substantiated by Campylobacter diarrhea rates in travelers to these  countries  of  27,000-38,000/100,000  per  year.  In  developing parts of Asia, Africa and Latin America, Campylobacter isolation rates have  ranged  from  5-20%  in  surveys  performed  in  children  with diarrhea.  Older  children  and  adults  are  infected  less  frequently because  acquired  immunity  increases  with  age.  Healthy  children living in tropical countries frequently have asymptomatic infection. Infections caused by C. coli are more likely to be asymptomatic than ones caused by C. jejuni [1, 4].

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Well-documented  risk  factors  for Campylobacter infections  include drinking well-water, visiting or living on a farm, and having exposure to pets with diarrhea and exposure to chickens living in the household.  Studies  of  fecal  output  of  household  chickens  of  peri-urban shantytowns in Lima, Peru, demonstrated that up to 61% of chickens were  colonized  with Campylobacter .  Viable  bacteria  can  survive  in chicken droppings for about 4 days. Contact with cats and dogs is also significant. Secondary spread of infection from person to person has not been documented, although household contacts have higher rates of infection than persons living in houses without cases of infection.  This  increased  rate  of  infection  is  attributable  to  common sources of exposure [1, 5, 6].

TRAVELER'S DIARRHEA
Campylobacter species are important causes of diarrhea in travelers to the developing world. Isolation rates vary by geographic location but tend to be highest in travelers returning from South America, North and East Africa, the Middle East, and South and Southeast Asia. In a study in Sweden, researchers found that the highest risk was seen in

Key features
- Campylobacter species are microaerophilic, small, curved Gram-negative rods associated with diarrhea in both developed and developing countries
- Commonly colonizes gastrointestinal tract of chickens and other animals, which serve as reservoirs
- Major cause of pediatric diarrhea and traveler's diarrhea in resource-poor countries, presenting as dysentery or as watery diarrhea
- Usually presents as bloody diarrhea and dysentery in higher-income country populations
- Associated with post-infectious in+ammatory conditions, including post-infectious arthropathy, Reiter's sundrome and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS)
- Diagnosed by stool culture, using special techniques developed speci*cally for this organism
- Macrolide antibiotics or +uoroquinolones are usually used for cases requiring antibiotic therapy

INTRODUCTION
Campylobacter jejuni is currently the leading identified cause of bacterial  gastroenteritis  in the  developed world and of significant prevalence in developing countries. Young children are the most susceptible group, in both  the  developing  and  the  developed  world [1].  Most Campylobacter infections are caused by C. jejuni or Campylobacter coli . These organisms are motile, comma-shaped, microaerophilic, Gramnegative  rods  with  a  corkscrew-like  motion  produced  by  a  polar, unsheathed  flagellum.  They  commonly  occur  as  commensals  in warm-blooded  animals,  especially  poultry  [2]. Campylobacter  jejuni strains can be differentiated by using two different serotyping schemes, one based on heat-labile flagellar protein, referred to as Lior serotypes (there  are  over  100  Lior  serotypes),  the  other  based  on  heat-stable flagellar  proteins  referred  to  as  Penner  serotypes (there are over 60 Penner serotypes).
Campylobacter was first identified in 1916 when two British veterinary surgeons reported a peculiar organism in the uterine mucus of pregnant sheep. In 1947, Vincent et al. isolated the organism from the blood of three pregnant women with sepsis and spontaneous abortion. The organism was most probably Campylobacter fetus , a common cause  of  veterinary  disease  but  uncommon  in  humans.  Later, Campylobacterlike  organisms  were  associated with  other  infections, including  endocarditis,  meningitis  and  gastroenteritis.  The  association  between Campylobacter and  diarrhea  was  not  made  until  the 1970s; this link was challenging  to prove because of  the fastidious nature of the organism and because of the stringent culture conditions required to isolate the organism from stool [3].

INTRODUCTION
returning travelers from the Indian subcontinent (1253 cases/100,000 travelers) and the lowest in travelers from the other Nordic countries (3/100,000  travelers).  In  Africa,  there  are  large  differences  in  risk between regions (502/100,000 in travelers from East Africa compared with  76/100,000  from  West  Africa  and  50/100,000  from  Central Africa) (Fig. 46.1) [6, 7].
Guillain-Barré  syndrome (GBS). Post-infectious inflammatory complications usually present within 1-6 weeks after ingestion [3].

CHUNK 7
============================================================
NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS AND PATHOLOGY
Campylobacter infection  causes local acute inflammatory changes in both the small and large bowel. The organism is able to invade and replicate  in  gut  epithelia,  causing  interleukin-8  (IL  8)  production, activation of the innate immune system via Toll-like receptors (TLR)-2 and TLR-4, and disruption of the integrity of the epithelial barrier. The induction of IL-8 causes the recruitment of dendritic cells, macrophages and neutrophils that interact with C. jejuni . These interactions result in a massive pro-inflammatory response and increases in corresponding cytokines [8].
After  6  months  of  age,  baseline  levels  of  serum  antibody  increase. Higher antibody responses in older children correlate with excretion of  few  organisms  and  with  the  presence  of  milder,  non-bloody diarrhea-findings  consistent  with  the  development  of  immunity [9].

============================================================
BREASTFEEDING AND INFECTION
The protection in breast-fed infants against Campylobacter appears to occur through acquired and innate defense factors found in human milk, including antibodies, oligosaccharides and their glycolconjugates. Milk glycans prevent Campylobacter infections and decrease its disease severity [10].

============================================================
CLINICAL FEATURES
In humans, the infective dose for Campylobacter jejuni is between 500 and 10,000 organisms. Symptoms occur 1-7 days following ingestion. Disease usually manifests as self-limited gastroenteritis lasting up to 7 days. Excretion of Campylobacter organisms typically lasts 2-3 weeks without treatment [2].
The  clinical  spectrum  ranges  from  watery  diarrhea  to  dysentery and may include mesenteric adenitis-giving a clinical picture that mimics appendicitis. Post-infectious complications include irritable bowel syndrome, post-infectious arthropathy, Reiter's syndrome and
In  the  developed  world ,  Campylobacter  jejuni enteritis  can  be  quite severe in children and adults. The most prominent features among patients who seek medical attention are bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain and fever. Abdominal pain is the most characteristic manifestation of illness. In hospital surveys, bloody diarrhea occurs in about half of the patients [3, 6].
In developing countries, Campylobacter jejuni enteritis is milder than in patients in developed countries. In Thailand, about one-third of symptomatic  infections  are  bloody,  one-third  are  watery  and  onethird are mucoid. In the developing world, bloody diarrhea is most often seen with Shigella infections. In one study in Thailand, Shigella organisms were associated with  grossly bloody diarrhea in 37% of cases, whereas Campylobacter and Salmonella organisms were associated with bloody stools in 14% and 26%, respectively. More than 10 fecal  leukocytes  per  high-power  microscopic  field  (an  indicator  of invasive  diarrheal  disease)  were  present  in  24-36%  of  patients infected with Campylobacter species. The incidence of bloody diarrhea and the duration of illness decrease with age among children from most developing countries [6].

============================================================
TRAVELER'S DIARRHEA
Campylobacter species  is  an  important  cause  of  traveler's  diarrhea. Most Campylobacter infections in travelers cause symptoms, although frank dysentery is rare. In a study of Spanish travelers with Campylobacter enteritis acquired in developing countries, only 4% had dysentery. Abdominal cramps were present in 83% of cases, fever in 46%, nausea and vomiting in 42%, and grossly bloody diarrhea in only 3% of cases [6, 7].

============================================================
Guillain-Barré Syndrome
GBS is an acute, immune-mediated flaccid paralysis frequently associated with Campylobacter infection. GBS is the most serious complication of Campylobacter infection  and C. jejuni is  the  most frequently observed antecedent infection in cases of GBS. Its incidence is about 1/1000 infections, and 1 in 3 GBS cases is associated with a preceding C. jejuni infection. Symptoms of GBS usually occur 1-3 weeks after the onset of Campylobacter enteritis. GBS cases associated with Campylobacter infection  are  usually  more  severe  than  nonCampylobacter -associated cases. The association of GBS and Campylobacter infection
relates  to  immune  responses  that  target  surface  antigens  of  certain C. jejuni strains and cross-reactive human antigens on the surface of neuronal sheath cells [3, 1 1].

CHUNK 12
============================================================
Irritable Bowel Syndrome
Post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome can occur following Campylobacter enteritis  and usually manifests as persistent abdominal discomfort,  bloating  and  diarrhea,  alternating  with  constipation,  that continue even with clearance of the inciting pathogen [12].

============================================================
Reactive Arthritis
Reactive arthritis is a spondyloarthropathy-a group of diseases with a  strong  association  with  HLA-B27,  absence  of  rheumatoid  factor, family aggregation and frequent extra-articular symptoms. Acute reactive arthritis is characterized by sterile joint inflammation. It typically develops within 4 weeks following an intestinal or urogenital infection with obligate or facultative intracellular bacteria, such as Salmonella , Shigella , Yersinia and Campylobacter .  The  joint  symptoms  vary from mild mono- or oligo-arthralgia, to severely disabling polyarthritis.  The arthritis has a predilection for joints of the lower extremity, particularly knees and ankles [13].
Campylobacter infection can lead to reactive arthritis with conjunctivitis and urethritis (Reiter's syndrome).

DIAGNOSIS
Transport of stool samples from patients with diarrhea looking for Campylobacter can be done in conventional containers but if delay is anticipated, samples should be placed in transport medium, such as Cary-Blair medium and kept cool. Transport medium should also be used  to  transport  rectal  swabs.  Some  studies  suggest  that Campylobacter enteritis can be diagnosed by direct microscopic examination of fresh liquid feces, either with Gram stain or a phase-contrast optical system  by  observing  typical  curved  small  bacilli  in  the  stool  [3]. However, if available, confirmation by stool culture is advisable.
Stool culture is the primary method for diagnosis of Campylobacter -related diarrhea. Isolation of C. jejuni and C. coli requires specialized, enriched, selective media incubated at 42°C under microaerophilic conditions [3]. Selective media for Campylobacter can be divided into two main groups: blood-containing media (e.g. Preston agar, Skirrow agar, Butzler agar, Campy-cefex) and charcoal-containing media (e.g. modified charcoal cefoperazone deoxycholate agar, Karmali agar or charcoal-selective medium). Most selective media also include antibiotic mixtures to suppress the growth of other contaminating flora [14].
Passive  filtration  is  another  isolation  method-it  takes  advantage of Campylobacter 's  high  motility,  obviates  the  need  for  selective media and can be used in resource-limited settings. Use of both selective media and a filter method is associated with maximal sensitivity [15].
Campylobacter species can also be detected directly in stool specimens by commercially available enzyme immunoassay or in research laboratories by PCR. Serology may be used to assess previous exposure in individuals with reactive arthritis, or Guillain Barré  syndrome (GBS) [15].

TREATMENT
The most important treatment for a patient with diarrhea is rehydration  therapy, which can usually be accomplished by the oral route. Campylobacter enteritis is often a self-limited infection not requiring antimicrobials, although antibiotic therapy is indicated for pregnant women and for patients with Campylobacter infection who are acutely ill, have persistent fever, bloody diarrhea or are immune-compromised individuals, including those with HIV infection [3].
For confirmed C . jejuni infection, macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin, azithromycin or clarithromycin are the antibiotics of choice. Treatment courses are usually for 3-7 days [16, 17]. Unfortunately, resistance of C. jejuni to fluoroquinolones is now common, especially in  Southeast  Asia,  markedly  limiting  the  utility  of  these  agents  in treating  individuals  with  campylobacteriosis.  Owing  to  widespread resistance, tetracyclines should also not be used.
In patients with bacteremia, treatment should be based on the identity of the infecting species and susceptibilities when available. Campylobacter fetus is the most common species associated with bacteremia and it is generally susceptible to aminoglycosides, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, meropenem and imipenem [16, 17].

PREVENTION AND CONTROL
Appropriate precautions in the handling and preparation of foods of animal  origin  reduce  cross-contamination.  Raw  meat  and  poultry should be cooked adequately. Hands should be washed thoroughly with soap after handling raw foods of animal origin and before touching anything else. Chopping boards used for raw meats should not be used for preparing other foods and should be cleaned well with soap and hot water. No vaccine is commercially available to prevent disease in humans.
