Key features
- Dental caries is the most prevalent non-communicable disease worldwide and the most widespread childhood disease
- Late presentation of oral carcinoma, often the result of tobacco use (particularly chewing tobacco) and alcohol, is frequently lethal because of late presentation
- The highest prevalences of oral diseases are found in resource-poor tropical communities
- The majority of oral disease in resource-poor tropical countries remains untreated or is treated after a long delay, when treatment is more complex and resource-demanding, with poorer outcomes

INTRODUCTION
The most prevalent oral diseases in poor tropical communities are the result of poverty and institutional neglect combined with a lack of education. Dental caries ( = dental decay) particularly of the primary (or baby) teeth is the most common childhood disease and the most frequent  non-communicable disease worldwide. Most of the decay remains untreated and leads to infection of dental origin ( = odontogenic) with serious impacts on child health and development [1].
The  oral  conditions  with  the  most  serious  consequences  are:  oral cancer, the oral manifestations of HIV/AIDS, noma (or cancrum oris; = gangrene  of  the  facial  tissues),  and  trauma  to  the  face  and  oral tissues (Boxes 15.1 & 15.2).
Providing  dental  care  for  patients  in  resource-poor  communities poses the same problems as for other medical disciplines - limited equipment, materials and adequately trained personnel. This chapter presents simple frontline emergency care that can be provided using simple, but effective methods.
It is not exhaustive either in the provision of extensive clinical management details or in its presentation of detailed pathologic information on all oral diseases. It provides the basics necessary for a field officer to deal with the most commonly presenting oral conditions. Details  of  technical  procedures  can  be  found  online  at:  http:// www.hesperian.org/publications_download.php: look for ' Where there is no dentist' by Murray Dickson.

EXAMINING THE ORO6MAXILLO6 FACIAL COMPLEX
A thorough oral examination begins outside the mouth because often there are signs of intraoral disease displayed outside the mouth, such as  swelling,  redness, trauma to the face, or sinus openings. Careful visual examination is essential together with palpation of the facial skeleton  and  of  any  swellings,  which  can  reveal  the  nature  of  the swelling (hard, soft, fixed to underlying structures or free etc.). Like all clinical examinations it is best to develop a scheme that follows the same routine each time.
The  intraoral  examination  likewise  should  always  follow  a  fixed routine (Box 15.3). Begin by examining the lips and corners of the mouth for cuts, abrasions and/or ulcerations. In elderly edentulous patients, it is not uncommon to find signs of candida infection (cracks that are red and inflamed that may sometimes bleed when the patient stretches their mouth wide open).
Next, pull back the lips and examine their lining mucosa; then the cheeks, as far back as is possible, for ulceration or localized changes in color and/or texture. Ask the patient to open their mouth so that you can examine the hard and soft palate. Take a soft gauze and get the patient to protrude their tongue; grasp it gently with the gauze and  examine  the  dorsal  and  ventral  surfaces  -  again  looking  for ulceration or localized changes in color (be careful not to cut the soft ventral surface of the tongue on the incisal edges of the lower anterior teeth).  Then  examine  the  teeth  for  cavities  (see  section  on  dental caries) and how the teeth meet together. Check how the patient opens their mouth; is it smooth, without clicking, do the midlines of the jaws move parallel with each other?

DESCRIPTION
Dental caries most commonly presents as pain on eating or drinking, particularly of hot or cold foods. In its later stages, when pulpal infection has passed to the periapical tissues surrounding the root tip(s), there may be swelling, redness and heat of the infected area, and, if the infection has spread to the deeper tissues, trismus ( = in ability to open the mouth). Other systemic symptoms are those of an  acute infection: fever, malaise.

============================================================
CHUNK 7
============================================================
ETIOLOGY
The resting saliva of the mouth normally has a neutral or alkaline pH. This changes when the microorganisms attached to the surfaces of the teeth (or dental plaque) metabolize dietary sugars to produce acids. These acids, through chemical action, release calcium and phosphate ions  from  the  hydroxyapatite  crystallites  that  form  the  enamel

BOX 15.2  Pediatric Considerations of Oral Conditions and Diseases
- Noma occurs largely in children 3-7 years of age, is a lifethreatening  and  life-changing  disease  for  which,  if  the initial infection is survived and halted, many reconstructive surgeries are necessary. Prevention is paramount
- Dental caries of the primary dentition, stunting and underweight are very common in resource-poor tropical countries
- There  is  some  evidence  that  treatment  of  odontogenic infection in young undernourished stunted children increases their rate of growth and weight
- Oro-facial trauma in children is common in resource-poor tropical countries

============================================================
Basic instrumentation for simple dental treatment As above plus:
- Dental forceps for the extraction of upper and lower primary and permanent molars, bicuspids ( = premolars), cuspids ( = canines) and incisors
- Scalpel (for incisions needed for certain extractions and to achieve drainage of pus)
- Sutures (to close wounds - both surgical and traumatic)
- Needle holders
- Dental excavators (for preparing dental cavities for restoration)
- Dental  plastic  instruments  (for  manipulating  restorative materials into prepared cavities)
- Spatula (for mixing the glass ionomer cement)
covering of the crowns of the teeth. The calcium and phosphate ions remain in the saliva.
The  drop  in  the  pH  of  the  saliva  around  the  teeth  is  relatively rapid  -  some  few  minutes.  The  resting  neutral  pH  takes  much longer to  be re-established  -  around  40  minutes  to  1  hour, depending,  among  other  things,  on  the  amount  and  stickiness  of the  sugary  food  eaten.
The very small, decalcified areas on the enamel surface are the initial lesions of the carious process. However, they are reversible lesions; if the  salivary  pH  returns  to  neutral  for  a  long  enough  time  period, then  the  calcium  and  phosphate  ions  that  have  leeched  out  will re-mineralize  back  into  the  crystallite  lattice.  This  information  is important when preparing dietary and feeding information for young mothers  and  also  in  developing  sound  evidence-based  preventive strategies.

CHUNK 12
============================================================
Basic instrumentation for simple dental treatment As above plus:
If sugar is eaten frequently, then the pH of the saliva remains low and more enamel is dissolved; ultimately, a physical break in the integrity of the enamel surface results. This minute cavity is then colonized by microorganisms, which, in turn, produce acid from sugar, and so the process continues until a visible cavity results. Once the dentine of the tooth is infected, the process continues with other types of microorganisms becoming involved until the pulp cavity of the tooth is reached and infected - ultimately resulting in a dental abscess at the root(s) tip with the infection spreading to the surrounding periodontal  ligament,  bone.  If  this  is  neglected  for  long  enough  or  infected with  virulent  organisms,  infection  spreads  beyond  into  other  soft tissues and tissue spaces. The visible sign when this has occurred is what are commonly called 'gum boils' in young children. Sometimes the  spread  of  infection  to  the  surrounding  tissues  may  be  lifethreatening  if,  for  example,  the  infection  spreads  from  the  upper anterior region to the cavernous sinus or from a lower posterior tooth to the pharyngeal spaces.

============================================================
CHUNK 13
============================================================
CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT
- Initial white spot lesions : re-mineralize by coating the area with fluoridated toothpaste, varnish or gel repeatedly.
- Initial cavitation : small visible break in the surface enamel, in the enamel only, cover with fissure sealant.
- More extensive cavitation, but small :  clean  and  fill  with  glass ionomer cement, coat with fissure sealant.
- Cavitation  involving  outer  layer  of  dentine :  use  hand  instruments to remove undermined enamel; remove soft and decayed dentine; restore with glass ionomer cement.
- Cavitation with more extensive dentine involvement extending to  more than one surface of the tooth, but not entering the pulp cavity : refer for traditional restoration.
- Cavitation  with  pulpal  involvement :  treatment  of  choice  in resource-poor tropical  countries  is  tooth  extraction  under  local anesthesia.
- Management  of  infections  associated  with  pulpal  infections that  have  spread  to  surrounding  tissues :  spreading  infections from  periapical  abscesses  can  become  life-threatening.  Drain frank pus; prescribe wide-spectrum antibiotics. Once the infection is under control, extract the tooth under local anesthesia.

PREVENTION - INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS
- Dietary advice : limit dietary use of sugars, particularly by reducing sugared and high-energy drinks, sweets and snacks, between-meal eating. There is little evidence that this alone is sufficient. It needs to be linked with one of the programs listed below. For details of  the  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  the  preventive  measures listed below, go to: http://www.ohg.cochrane.org/reviews.html.
- Toothbrushing  with  fluoridated  toothpaste :  check  that  the toothpaste  has  fluoride  -  if  possible,  find  one  that  has  been approved by a dental organization like the American Dental Association or FDI World Dental Federation as not all toothpaste that states it contains fluoride has fluoride in it in many resource-poor tropical countries.
- Fluoride mouth rinsing.
- Fluoride varnish programs .
- Topically applied fluoride gels .

============================================================
GENERAL ETIOLOGY
In general, the known causes for oral mucosal problems and tumors range from infectious agents - bacterial, viral and fungal infections - to trauma sustained over a long period as occurs in tobacco users either from smoke inhalation, heat from burning tobacco, or from specific components of the tobacco and any other substances with which  it  has  been  mixed.  The  effects  of  tobacco  use  appear  to  be exacerbated when combined with alcohol use. The cause of a number of invasive tumors, such as ameloblastomas, is not understood at the present time. Systemic diseases may also play a part in oral mucosal diseases.

To be diKerentiated from a dislocated mandible where the patient cannot close their mouth normally there is no obvious break in the bone and the heads of the mandibular condyles are anterior to their normal resting position - your Hngers Ht into a deep dimple on each side of the patient's face when you try to palpate the mandibular condyles. Pain from lower jaw, inability to close teeth together normally, diJculty in opening and closing the mouth, blood in mouth. History of trauma, Possible diagnosis = Mandibular fracture Mandibular dislocation. Pain from lower jaw, inability to close teeth together normally, diJculty in opening and closing the mouth, blood in mouth. History of trauma, Actions = Urgent care. Position the patient comfortably - seated and leaning forward slightly and place a Hgure-of-eight bandage to hold the two fractured parts in a stable position. To reposition a recently dislocated mandible: stand in front of the seated patient. Place a thumb on the last molar, with your Hngers under the tip of the chin. Press down hard on your thumbs, at the same time rotate the chin upwards and push the

mandible backwards into the articular fossae. Instruct the patient to gently move their jaws but not to yawn or open widely for the next few days. Broken, displaced and mobile upper anterior teeth with broken alveolar bone, Appearance = This is usually the result of being hit in the face or a fall. A mobile section of bone containing a number of upper anterior teeth. Broken, displaced and mobile upper anterior teeth with broken alveolar bone, Possible diagnosis = Simple dento-alveolar fracture of the maxilla. Broken, displaced and mobile upper anterior teeth with broken alveolar bone, Actions = Managed by placing a splint attached to adjacent undamaged teeth either with eyelet wires and an arch bow or by splinting using composite resin. Major trauma involving the middle third of the face, from a hard direct impact often in a road traJc accident. Bleeding from the mouth, nose and possibly ears, Appearance = Patient may have diJculty on breathing or swallowing and be bleeding from the nose and mouth. The orbits may be involved and consciousness impaired. ConHrmation from posterior-anterior radiographs and other views, depending on the site of the major injuries. Major trauma involving the middle third of the face, from a hard direct impact often in a road traJc accident. Bleeding from the mouth, nose and possibly ears, Possible diagnosis = Simple or compound fractures of the maxilla. They may range from a fracture of the zygomatic arch to a complex fracture involving the base of the skull. Major trauma involving the middle third of the face, from a hard direct impact often in a road traJc accident. Bleeding from the mouth, nose and possibly ears, Actions = An urgent assessment should be made of the extent of the injuries and if there is a concomitant brain injury. If brain injury suspected, attention to this takes precedence over the maxillary injuries. These cases require referral to specialist care
situations where health and safety issues are not strong components of  industrial  regulations/laws.  To  these  have  to  be  added  motor vehicle accidents that occur in poor countries, caused by poor vehicle maintenance, poor driving and poor road conditions.
Less often seen are physical and chemical burns both to the face and inside the mouth. The flammable nature of housing and the use of kerosene lamps, heaters and cooking stoves make fire a frequent event in poor areas. Burns to the face and upper body occur often.

AETIOLOGY
Chemical  burns may  occur because patients  with  untreated  dental caries and toothache often resort to using aspirin or other substances. Believing  their  pain is associated with a particular tooth, they may place an aspirin in the buccal sulcus next to the painful tooth, not realizing of course that aspirin works systemically and not locally. If the aspirin remains in place for long, it will cause ulceration of the oral mucosa; a chemical burn. This ulcer is then painful itself and will take time to heal.
All  serious  trauma  cases  must  receive  emergency  care  promptly  to maintain the airway, stop hemorrhage and maintain the heart rate and then be referred to those capable of making a full assessment and providing treatment.
