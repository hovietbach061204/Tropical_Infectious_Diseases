pets. The Turkana of Kenya, who have the highest infection rate in the world, live very closely with dogs (Fig. 128.1A). In endemic regions, the practice of feeding raw infected viscera of slaughtered livestock to dogs facilitates transmission of E. granulosus.

CHUNK 1
============================================================
NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
The  adult  tapeworm  of E.  granulosus parasitizes  a  wide  variety  of canids (e.g. domestic dogs, foxes, wolves, and dingoes), which serve as final, definitive hosts. These adult worms are small, ranging in size 2-12 mm in length, with 3-6 segments. They typically localize in the lower duodenum and jejunum of the definitive host. Embryophores (eggs) containing infective embryos are expelled in large numbers in the feces of the final host. Intermediate hosts are usually farm animals (e.g. sheep, cattle, swine or horses), that acquire infection by ingestion of infectious eggs in the pasture (Fig. 128.2). The embryo or oncosphere  is  released  by  the  action  of  gastric  and  intestinal  enzymes, penetrates the intestinal wall and is transported by the blood stream to  the  liver  or  other  organs.  Once  the  oncosphere  reaches  its  final location,  it  develops  into  an  echinococcal  cyst  (metacestode).  The echinococcal cyst is a fluid-filled, spherical, unilocular cyst that consists  of  an  inner  germinal  layer  of  cells  supported  by  an  acellular, laminated membrane of variable thickness. Each cyst is surrounded by a host-produced layer of granulomatous adventitial reaction. Small vesicles called brood capsules bud internally from the germinal layer and produce multiple protoscolices by asexual division.
In humans, who are accidental hosts, the slowly growing hydatid cysts can attain a volume of several liters and contain many thousands of protoscolices. With time, internal septations and daughter cysts can form, disrupting the unilocular pattern typical of the young echinococcal cysts.

CLINICAL FEATURES
Signs and symptoms of hydatid disease depend on the organ involved and the size of the cyst. The onset of symptoms varies from months to several years and results from pressure exerted by the growing cyst. Cysts grow at varying rates.
Cysts occur more frequently in the liver (52-77%; Fig. 128.1A, B), followed by the lungs (9-44%; Fig. 128.3) and other locations (1319%). Most infections have a single cyst.

CHUNK 3
============================================================
LIVER CYSTS
Liver cysts occur more frequently in the right lobe-most individuals with hepatic hydatid cysts  are asymptomatic [9]. Physical examination may reveal abdominal distention (Fig. 128.1A) and a palpable mass in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen, with or without hepatomegaly. When the cyst has reached large dimensions, complications usually occur. Cysts sometimes become infected with bacteria and can clinically resemble a liver abscess. Acute signs and symptoms follow rupture of a cyst, which can occur spontaneously, secondary to a traumatic event or during surgery. Rupture may occur into a bile

Key features
- Zoonotic parasitic disease principally transmitted between dogs and domestic livestock, particularly sheep
- Human cystic echinococcosis occurs in parts of the world where sheep are raised and dogs are used to herd livestock
- The liver is the most common site of the echinococcal or hydatid cyst followed by lungs; cysts occur less frequently in the spleen, kidneys, heart, bone, and central nervous system
- New sensitive and speci,c diagnostic methods and e-ective therapeutic approaches against cystic hydatid disease (CHD) have been developed in the last 10 years
- Treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy with anthelminthic agents, or puncture-aspiration-injection-reaspiration (PAIR), the latter being restricted to the treatment of liver cysts
- Despite some progress in the control of echinococcosis, this zoonosis continues to be a major public health problem in several countries and in several others it constitutes an emerging and re-emerging disease

INTRODUCTION
Cystic echinococcosis is the infection of humans and mammals by the larval stage of the zoonotic cestode Echinococcus granulosus [1]. It is also known as cystic hydatid disease (CHD).

============================================================
CHUNK 6
============================================================
EPIDEMIOLOGY
Echinococcal  infection  is  widely  prevalent  in  regions  of  the  world where  dogs  are  used  to  care  for  large  flocks  of  sheep.  It  is  widely distributed in South America, the areas bordering the Mediterranean Sea,  southern  and  central  Russia,  central  Asia,  China,  Australia, and  Africa  [1-3].  In  South  America,  echinococcosis  is  endemic  in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, southern Brazil, Peru, and Uruguay [4].
Studies  using  portable  ultrasonography  and  chest  radiography  in endemic areas of Peru showed that 6% of the population had hydatid cysts [2, 5]. The infection rates were 32% in dogs and 89% in sheep in the same area [2]. In north-west Turkana, Kenya, ultrasonography demonstrated 5.6% of the tribe had hepatic hydatid cysts [6].
Autochthonous cases of human hydatid disease are rare in the USA; however, foci of endemic transmission in the sheep-dog cycle have been detected in recent years in Arizona and New Mexico [7]. Cystic echinococcosis  has  re-emerged  in  certain  areas  where  it  was  once believed to be controlled, such as in Bulgaria and Wales [8]. Populations at most risk use dogs to herd sheep but also keep them as house

EPIDEMIOLOGY
duct, resulting in obstructive jaundice and colic-like pain followed by bacterial overgrowth. Rupture into the peritoneal cavity usually leads to secondary formation of numerous peritoneal cysts from released protoscolices  and,  on  rare  occasions,  to  peritonitis.  Rupture  and leakage  of  cyst  fluid  may  also  lead  to  an  erythematous  rash  or  to anaphylaxis.

============================================================
CHUNK 8
============================================================
LUNG CYSTS
Non-complicated lung cysts rarely produce symptoms and are usually found incidentally after a routine chest radiograph (Fig. 128.3)[10]. In  patients  who  are  symptomatic,  chest  pain  with  fever,  cough, dyspnea  and  hemoptysis  are  often  the  presenting  symptoms;  the illness  can  be  confused with pulmonary tuberculosis.

partial rupture of a cyst often leads to expectoration of hydatid fluid and/or  membranes,  followed  by  bacterial  overgrowth  and  a  lung abscess.  Physical  examination  may  reveal  dullness  with  absence  of breath sounds. Rupture into the lung may cause pneumothorax and empyema, allergic reactions (e.g. pruritus, urticaria) and, rarely, anaphylactic shock. Rupture into the pleural space with secondary formation of hydatid occurs rarely.

============================================================
CHUNK 9
============================================================
OTHER SITES
Hydatid cysts have been reported in almost any organ. The spleen is the  next  most  common  abdominal  organ  affected,  accounting  for 3-5% of all abdominal cysts. Heart or intracerebral cysts each have been reported in 1-1.5% of patients.

============================================================
CHUNK 10
============================================================
PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The presence of an enlarged liver and/or palpable mass in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, or a cannon ball-appearing lesion on chest radiographs suggests the clinical diagnosis of hydatid disease. A patient coming from an endemic area who gives a history of expectoration of a salty-tasting fluid with hemoptysis has a high probability of having a pulmonary hydatid cyst.
Hepatic  hydatid  cysts  can  be  confused  with  any  space-occupying lesion, including congenital liver cysts, choledochal cysts, amebic or bacterial  liver  abscess,  and  primary  and  secondary  hepatic  tumors. Symptoms caused by lung cysts may be similar to those of pulmonary tuberculosis. Congenital cysts, bronchogenic cysts, and lung abscesses may also be confused with pulmonary hydatid cysts.
Abdominal  ultrasonography  and  computed  tomography  (CT)  are the  methods  of  choice  for  detecting  abdominal  cysts  (Fig.  128.4) [1 1].  In  1995,  the  World  Health  Organization-informal  Working Group on Echinococcosis (WHO-IWGE) developed a standardized classification  that  could  be  applied  in  all  settings  to  allow  for  a natural grouping of the cysts into three relevant groups: active cystic echinococcosis (CE) 1 and 2, transitional (CE3) and inactive (CE4 and  5).  The  WHO-IWGE  classification  differs  from  the  previous Gharbi's classification introduced in 1981 by adding a 'cystic lesion' (CL) stage (undifferentiated). CE3 transitional cysts are differentiated into CE3a (with detached endocyst) and CE3b (predominantly solid with daughter vesicles). CE1 and CE3a are early stages and CE4 and CE5 late stages.
A posteroanterior chest radiograph is the method of choice for diagnosis of lung cysts (Fig. 128.3).
A wide variety of serologic assays have been developed with varying sensitivities and specificities (Chapter 152). However, a considerable number  of  patients,  particularly  those  with  lung  cysts,  may  not develop a detectable immune response [12]. Parasitologic examination of expectorated or aspirated fluid may reveal protoscolices and/ or hooklets (Fig. 128.5).

============================================================
CHUNK 11
============================================================
TREATMENT
Treatment  indications  for  cystic  echinococcoses  are  complex  and should  be  based  on  cyst  characteristics,  available  medical/surgical expertise  and  equipment,  and  adherence  of  patients  to  long-term monitoring.  No  clinical  trial  has  compared  different  treatment modalities;  therefore,  there  is  no  single  best  treatment  option  for cystic echinococcosis.

============================================================
CHUNK 12
============================================================
'WATCH AND WAIT'
Ultrasound  surveys  have  revealed the presence of cysts  which have  consolidated  and  calcified  and  have  become  inactive.  If  such lesions  do  not  compromise  organ  functions  or  cause  symptoms then a 'Watch and wait' approach  may be taken leaving the  cysts untreated. Careful ultrasound monitoring should be done in these situations [13].

============================================================
CHUNK 13
============================================================
CHEMOTHERAPY
Benzimidazole therapy can cure, or partially improve, two-thirds of cysts  [14].  The  efficacy  of  benzimidazoles  depend  on  a  variety  of factors such as the size, type and location of the cysts. For example, bone cysts respond very poorly to benzimidazoles as a result of poor diffusion of the drug to the site of the parasitic lesion.
Benzimidazoles are also indicated in patients with multiple cysts in one or more organs or with peritoneal hydatidosis. Perioperative use

of  benzimidazoles can reduce the risk of secondary echinococcosis following surgery.  Albendazole should also be used in prophylaxis before and after puncture-aspiration-injection-re-aspiration (PAIR).

============================================================
CHUNK 14
============================================================
CHEMOTHERAPY
Both albendazole (10-15 mg/kg/day) and mebendazole (40-50 mg/ kg/day)  have  demonstrated  efficacy  against  cystic  echinococcosis [15-17].  However,  the  results  for  albendazole  have  been  superior, probably because of its pharmacokinetic profile, which favors intestinal absorption and penetration into the cyst. An intermittent treatment  schedule  with  cycles  of  28  days  with  14-day  periods  of  rest has been recommended in the past, but evidence suggests that continuous  treatment  with  no  monthly  interruptions  may  be  equally effective  [13].  Administration  of  albendazole  with  fat-rich  meals facilitates absorption and bioavailability. Adverse reactions (neutropenia, liver toxicity, alopecia and others), reversible upon cessation of treatment, have been noted in a few patients. Examination for adverse reactions (aminotransferases and blood-count) should be performed regularly: every 2 weeks during the first 3 months and then monthly for  1  year.  Contraindications  to  chemotherapy  include  pregnancy, chronic hepatic diseases and bone marrow depression. The combination of praziquantel and albendazole has been used successfully in the treatment of hydatid disease. Nitazoxanide does not appear to be effective.

============================================================
CHUNK 15
============================================================
PERCUTANEOUS ASPIRATION OF HEPATIC CYSTS UNDER ULTRASONOGRAPHIC GUIDANCE (PAIR)
PAIR is a technique for the treatment of cysts in the liver and other abdominal  locations.  PAIR  consists  of:  (i)  percutaneous  puncture using sonographic guidance; (ii) aspiration of substantial amounts of the liquid contents; (iii) injection of a protoscolicidal agent (e.g. 95% ethanol  or  hypertonic  saline)  for  at  least  15  minutes;  and  (iv) re-aspiration.  PAIR  is  usually  indicated  for  patients  who  cannot undergo surgery, for those who refuse surgery or for cases of relapse after  surgery,  or failure to  respond  to  benzimidazoles. PAIR is contraindicated for inaccessible or superficially located liver cysts, for CE2 and CE3b cysts, for inactive or calcified cystic lesions (CE4, CE5) and for lung cysts. The presence of biliary fistulae is also a contraindication for protoscolicide use.
Recent application of PAIR in conjunction with albendazole has been used  with  good  results  and  offers  an  alternative  to  surgery.  Some studies  have  shown  that  PAIR  has  a  lower  rate  of  complications, shorter  (or  no)  hospitalization  and  lower  costs  than  does  surgical removal, and is the method of  choice for the  treatment of hepatic cysts in centers having experience with this technique. PAIR should be  performed  with  monitoring  so  that  potential  complications  of anaphylaxis, asthma or laryngeal edema can be adequately treated. Combined use of albendazole (10 mg/kg/day for 8 weeks) and PAIR has  been  shown  to  be  more  effective  than  either  treatment  alone [18-20].

============================================================
CHUNK 16
============================================================
SURGERY
Surgery remains the treatment of choice when cysts are large ( > 10 cm diameter), secondarily infected or located in certain organs (i.e. brain, heart). The main objective of surgery is total removal of the cyst while avoiding the adverse consequences of spilling its contents. Pericystectomy, is the usual procedure, but simple drainage, capitonage, marsupialization  and  resection  of  the  involved  organ  may  be  used depending on the location and condition of the cyst(s). Preoperative albendazole  or  mebendazole  is  indicated  to  prevent  secondary recurrences  following  leakage  or  rupture  of  cyst  and  spillage  of  its contents [21].

============================================================
CHUNK 17
============================================================
PREVENTION
Periodic  mass  treatment  of  dogs  with  praziquantel,  prohibition  of giving raw infected viscera to dogs and adequate inspection of abattoirs, as well as educational measures to change human practices that facilitate hydatid disease transmission, have been effective in controlling echinococcosis [22, 23].
