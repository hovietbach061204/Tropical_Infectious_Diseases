Key features
- Brucellosis is a common zoonotic infection worldwide with signi(cant medical, veterinary, and economic consequences
- The disease is transmitted by direct contact with, or consumption of, products of a variety of domestic and wild animals
- Human disease can manifest in myriad ways, including prolonged fever, granulomatous hepatitis, uveitis, endocarditis, and osteoarticular or genitourinary involvement
- Infection is often characterized by its chronicity
- Treatment involves combination antimicrobial therapy and should be administered for a minimum of 6 weeks
- There is no vaccine commercially available for use in humans. Prevention is usually targeted to risk factor reduction and behavioral modi(cations, for example avoidance of consumption of unpasteurized dairy products
- Synonyms: Malta fever, Undulant fever, Bang's disease

INTRODUCTION
Brucellosis is a zoonotic infection with worldwide distribution that is caused by species of the genus Brucella including Brucella melitensis, Brucella  abortus,  Brucella  suis ,  and Brucella  canis .  Brucellosis  is  an ancient disease with lesions attributed to possible brucellosis recently recognized in a 2.4-2.8-million-year-old hominid [1]. In the late 19th century, the pathogen was implicated in human disease and isolated from goat milk by Sir David Bruce (hence the name Brucella) and his colleagues in Malta.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
An estimated half a million new cases of brucellosis occur each year worldwide, with four major high-risk zones delineated by recent epidemiologic  data  [2]:  the  Middle  East,  Central  Asia,  parts  of  Latin America, and the Mediterranean, with particularly increasing trends observed in the Balkan Peninsula (Fig. 70.1). There is limited information about the extent of disease prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa because of limited veterinary surveillance and diagnostic facilities for the detection of human disease. In India, the disease remains endemic; in Southeast Asia known burden is unknown, with confirmed cases being limited to case reports. Disease distribution strongly correlates with  general  socioeconomic  status  and  exposure  to  animals  and animal products [2].

NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
Brucella  species  are,  in  general,  host-specific.  The  vast  majority  of human disease is attributed to B. melitensis , the natural reservoirs of which are sheep and goats. Brucella abortus (bovine brucellosis) causes a significant percentage of cases, particularly in countries with a tradition  in  cow-raising.  Both  these  species  can  also  reside  in  camels. Brucella suis (swine brucellosis) and B. canis (canine brucellosis) are rare  causes  of  human  disease,  although  there  is  concern  about  the former's presence in wild boars and the subsequent risk for hunters [3]. Brucella ovis (also found in sheep) and Brucella neotomae (found in rodents) are not human pathogens. Additional species have also been recently identified, including Brucella ceti and Brucella pinnipedialis (causing  brucellosis  in  marine  mammals)  [4], Brucella  microti (found in wild foxes of Central Europe) and Brucella inopinata , a novel species recently isolated from a human case [5].
Humans are infected through direct contact with infected animals or animal products. Shepherds and abattoir workers are at occupational risk of infection. Humans also become infected through the ingestion of contaminated animal products, such as unpasteurized dairy products, or through the inhalation of aerosolized particles [6]. The latter mode of transmission, often overlooked, lies behind the potential use of Brucella spp. in biological warfare (although its significance in such settings  is  largely  historical)  [7],  but  also  explains  why  brucellosis remains a common laboratory-acquired infection in microbiologists and laboratory technicians [8].
Brucella reside within  infected macrophages and, potentially, other phagocytes and establish latent and chronic infection [9]. The components of protective immunity are poorly understood [10].

CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSIS
Clinical brucellosis can present in myriad ways. The commonest presentation is nonspecific, with fever and malaise. Typically, symptoms are  mild  and  are  often  reported  from  patients  for  weeks  prior  to diagnosis.  Physical  examination  can  reveal  lymphadenopathy  and hepatosplenomegaly in a minority of patients. Focal disease involving osteoarticular structures is common, including peripheral arthritis or sacroiliitis (the latter predominantly in younger patients), or spondylitis.  Epididymo-orchitis  is  common  in  male  patients.  Table  70-1 lists other clinical characteristics of uncomplicated, or focal, brucellosis.
Involvement of the bone marrow can lead to mild pancytopenia; relative lymphocytosis is common. Liver function tests are often moderately abnormal. Lactic acid levels may be increased in joint fluid of affected joints [1 1] and radiographic evidence of spondylitis is highly suggestive of brucellosis [12].
Definitive diagnosis rests on isolation of the pathogen, but diagnosis usually rests on serologic analysis. Blood cultures should be incubated for up to 4 weeks. Serologic analysis usually involves the use of serum agglutination  tests  (SAT),  with  a  titer  equal  to  or  above  1  :  320

TREATMENT
Antibiotic  regimens  to  treat  individuals  with  brucellosis  usually contain at least two agents and treatment should be continued for weeks.  Consensus recommendations for uncomplicated disease are summarized in Table 70-3 [15]. Doxycycline and streptomycin may be  microbiologically  optimal  but,  because  of  convenience, doxycycline and rifampin are usually the drugs of choice for treating individuals with non-spondylitic brucellosis. Doxycycline and gentamycin are also being used.
There  is  evidence  to  suggest  that  doxycycline-streptomycin  is  the combination of choice for patients with brucellosis complicated by

TREATMENT
spondylitis  (but  not  other  osteoarticular  complications)  and  that treatment in such patients should be extended possibly to 12 weeks [16]. Many clinicians use at least three drugs to treat individuals with brucellosis involving the central nervous system and individuals with brucella-associated endocarditis usually require surgical intervention. Young children with brucellosis are usually treated with rifampin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
Even  with  effective  drug  treatment,  relapses  occur  in  5-10%  of patients, usually in the early post-treatment period. Relapses tend to be  mild and  can  be  re-treated  with  the  same,  or  another,  first-line regimen.
A minority of patients complain of malaise and nonspecific depressive symptoms following completion of effective drug regimens. Brucella have occasionally been isolated from such patients years after treatment, underscoring the potential chronicity of brucellosis [9, 17]. Currently,  there  is  no  vaccine  commercially  available  for  use  in humans. Prevention is usually targeted to risk factor reduction and behavioral modifications, for example avoidance of the consumption of unpasteurized dairy products.
