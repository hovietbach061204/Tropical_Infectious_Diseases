============================================================
KEY FEATURES
- Yersinia enterocolitica encompasses a heterogeneous collection of facultatively anaerobic gram-negative rods that belong to the family Enterobacteriaceae . Y. enterocolitica is found in dairy products, meats (e.g., pork and poultry), and vegetables.
- Y. enterocolitica infection is complex and remains poorly understood because most cases of yersiniosis are sporadic without an apparent source.
- Y. enterocolitica is primarily associated with gastrointestinal disease but can cause extraintestinal infections in immunocompromised hosts, especially in conditions of iron overload.
- mimicking appendicitis (pseudo-appendicitis), and surgery may be inadvertently performed for suspected appendicitis.
- glomerulonephritis, myocarditis, Reiter's syndrome, and erythema nodosum, can occur after Y. enterocolitica infection in individuals.
- isolation from biological specimens.
- with severe enteritis. Cefotaxime and ceftriaxone alone, or in combination with aminoglycosides, are effective in the treatment of individuals with Y. enterocolitica bacteremia.
- after exposure to pigs or raw pork products, as well as avoiding consumption of raw pork, are important preventive measures.

INTRODUCTION
Yersinia  enterocolitica is  an  important  foodborne  organism  with worldwide distribution. It is a facultative, non-lactose-fermenting, gram-negative  rod  belonging  to  the  family  Enterobacteriaceae and is a member of the genus Yersinia . Within this genus, there are total of 11 species and only 3 ( Y. pestis, Y . pseudotuberculosis, and Y.  enterocolitica )  are  regarded  as  pathogenic  for  humans. 1 The pathogen has the capacity to grow in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. As Y.  enterocolitica has  the  ability  to  multiply  under extreme environmental conditions, it is well adapted to survival in cooler temperate zones as well as in microaerophilic environments, including aquatic environments. It is motile at 25°C but non-motile at 37°C. 2,3 Y. enterocolitica is not able to grow at pH
< 4.2 or > 9.0, or at salt concentrations  greater than  7%. 4 Y. enterocolitica lacks a siderophore, and growth is enhanced in the presence of a heme-rich environment with high concentrations of  iron. The  organism  primarily  causes  gastrointestinal  disease but can cause extraintestinal infections, particularly in immunocompromised  hosts  and  in  conditions  associated  with  iron overload.

============================================================
EPIDEMIOLOGY
Y.  enterocolitica was  discovered  more than 60 years ago  but was not  considered  a  human  or  veterinary  pathogen  until  the  late 1960s  when  it  became  progressively  recognized  in  foodborne gastrointestinal infections. 2 The epidemiology of Y. enterocolitica infections is complex and remains poorly understood because most cases are sporadic without an apparent source. The incidence of Y. enterocolitica foodborne infection varies according to geography and climate. Chakraborty et al. analyzed the surveillance data from nine U.S. states during the period of 2005-2011 and found differences in the epidemiology of yersiniosis by race and also reported seasonality  among  African  Americans  and  white  populations. 5 Y.  enterocolitica -associated gastroenteritis is reported worldwide, most commonly from northern European countries. The infection is rarely reported from tropical regions. 3 The natural reservoir of Y. enterocolitica is  the intestinal tracts of farm animals, especially pigs, cows, and goats. The bacteria can also be isolated from the feces of dogs and cats. There are over 60 serogroups of Y. enterocolitica but only 11 are implicated in human disease.
A major source of infection in humans is ingestion of raw or improperly  cooked  swine  products,  such  as  chitterlings  (pig intestines).  Person-to-person  transmission  is  rare.  However, contamination of food by infected food handlers has been reported. Nosocomial and foodborne outbreaks have also been described. 3,6 In 1980s, two large foodborne outbreaks were reported in China; one was caused by beef contamination in 1986 in Lanzhou, Gansu Province and was caused by Y. enterocolitica O:3; the second occurred in a school in Shenyang, Liaoning Province and was caused by Y. enterocolitica O:8. 7,8 In recent times McDonald et al. investigated one of the largest foodborne outbreaks in Norway in 2014, which was caused by consumption of mixed salad in the military  and civilian populations. 9

============================================================
NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
Infection with Y. enterocolitica occurs after ingestion of contaminated food or water. Yersinia species have a marked tropism for lymphoid tissue,  and  bacteria  migrate  to  the  terminal  ileum,  where  they adhere to M cells in the Peyer's patches and penetrate through these cells to colonize lymphoid follicles. Continued proliferation of bacteria in the lamina propria enables the bacteria to survive and spread to other organs, such as the liver, spleen, and mesenteric
lymph nodes. Virulence is associated with three chromosomally to block various steps in the phagocytic pathway. Non-pathogenic strains of Yersinia 10 pCD)  that  is  absent  in  avirulent  strains,  and  by  production  of heat-stable enterotoxin  controlled  by  chromosomal  genes ystA, ystB, and ystC . 11
An association of Y. enterolitica sepsis in patients with hematologic dyscrasias, such as thalassemia or aplastic anemia requiring frequent transfusions and deferoxamine as an iron-chelating agent, is well established. This propensity is related to the ability of Y. enterocolitica to use ferrioxamine as a growth factor. 12

============================================================
CHUNK 6
============================================================
Gastroenteritis
Y. enterocolitica can cause illness ranging from acute watery diarrhea or dysentery to fatal necrotizing enterocolitis. Infection is more common in children and often associated with fever and vomiting. 13 The illness may last for 3 to 28 days. Exposure to the small intestines of pigs, especially when steamed or fried for food (also known as chitterlings or chitlins ),  has  been  associated  with  a  high  risk  of Y. enterocolitica enteritis in children. Infants younger than 3 months old are at risk of developing bacteremia and sepsis. Infections with serogroup O:8 may be severe and can cause extensive ulceration of the gastrointestinal tract and death. In young adults, Y. enterolitica infection can present with acute terminal ileitis and mesenteric lymphadenitis  mimicking  other  diseases  such  as  appendicitis (pseudo-appendicitis) or in|ammatory bowel disease (IBD), often delaying diagnosis and treatment. 14,15 Surgery may be inadvertently performed for  suspected  appendicitis.  Infected  individuals  may shed Y. enterocolitica in stools for weeks after resolution of symptoms. Treatment  with  antibiotics  shortens  the  duration  of  bacterial shedding. 16

============================================================
CHUNK 7
============================================================
Septicemia
Septicemia is reported in patients with predisposing conditions, such as alcoholism, diabetes mellitus, immune de{ciency, and iron overload. Invasion of the bloodstream may result in abscess formation in the liver or spleen, pneumonia, septic arthritis, meningitis, panophthalmitis, osteomyelitis, and endocarditis, or localize in a major blood vessel leading to a mycotic aneurysm. Occasionally, sepsis may be acquired through transfusion of contaminated blood that has been stored for long periods. 17-19

============================================================
CHUNK 8
============================================================
Post-Infectious Sequelae
Y. enterocolitica can cause post-infectious in|ammatory conditions, such as reactive arthritis. Individuals with the HLA-B27 haplotype are  particularly  susceptible  and  can  develop  arthritis,  Reiter's syndrome, glomerulonephritis, myocarditis, and erythema nodosum after Y. enterocolitica infection. Joint symptoms occur in up to 2% of patients, usually 1 to 2 weeks after gastrointestinal illness. The large joints of the lower extremities are most commonly involved, and symptoms usually persist for 1 to 4 months, although prolonged syndromes can occur.  Erythema nodosum manifests  as painful, raised,  red  or  purple  lesions  on  the  lower  extremities  within  3 weeks of infection and usually resolves spontaneously. 19-21

============================================================
CHUNK 9
============================================================
MISCELLANEOUS INFECTIONS
Y.  enterocolitica has  rarely  been  reported  to  cause  urinary  tract infections, conjunctivitis, localized skin abscess, intussusception, and appendicitis. Pharyngitis after oral ingestion of the organism has also been reported.

============================================================
CHUNK 10
============================================================
DIAGNOSIS
De{nitive diagnosis usually rests on isolating the organism from stool, blood, or other specimens, including mesenteric lymph nodes, pharyngeal exudates, peritoneal |uid, synovial |uid, urine, or bile. 21 It is important to notify laboratory personnel when yersiniosis is suspected  because  many  laboratories  do  not  routinely  test  for Yersinia . Y.  enterocolitica grow  as  small,  non-lactose-fermenting colonies on MacConkey agar kept at 25°C for 48 hours. Growth can be enhanced by use of differential agar such as cefsulodinirgasan novobiocin (CIN) agar, as well as cold enrichment techniques. High levels of antibodies to Yersinia may be helpful in the diagnosis of post-infectious complications. In regions where the background seroprevalence to Yersinia antigens is high, serologic {ndings  must  be  interpreted  with  caution. 22 Ultrasound  or computed tomography (CT) scanning may be useful in differentiating Yersinia mesenteric adenitis from acute appendicitis. 21

============================================================
CHUNK 11
============================================================
TREATMENT
Y.  enterocolitica are  usually  susceptible  to  cotrimoxazole,  |uoroquinolone,  aminoglycosides,  chloramphenicol,  third-generation cephalosporins, aztreonam, and imipenem. Cefotaxime and ceftriaxone are the most active third-generation cephalosporins against Y. enterocolitica.
Use of antibiotics in uncomplicated enteritis is controversial; hydration is the mainstay of therapy. Antibiotics are indicated in immunocompromised individuals to prevent or mitigate bacteremia aminoglycoside (in combination) or |uoroquinolone therapy is indicated. Antimotility agents are contraindicated in the treatment of Y. enterocolitica enteritis. Cefotaxime and ceftriaxone, alone or in combination with aminoglycosides, are effective in the treatment of Y.  enterocolitica bacteremia.  Deferoxamine  therapy  should  be discontinued during treatment of Yersinia bacteremia. 23-25

============================================================
CHUNK 12
============================================================
PREVENTION AND CONTROL
Avoidance  of  contact  with  excreta  from  pigs  or  domestic  pets, well-controlled pasteurization of milk, provision of safe drinking water, and good hygiene practices at all stages of food production and processing may reduce the risk of Y. enterocolitica infection. 4

KEY FEATURES
- Clostridium spp. are ubiquitous, gram-positive, spore-forming bacteria that cause a wide range of diseases, including botulism, tetanus, soft tissue infections, neonatal sepsis, and enteric infections.
- C. perfringens causes gas gangrene and self-limited food poisoning syndrome associated with eating contaminated beef, poultry, and precooked foods that undergo slow cooling.
- C. botulinum causes botulism, a cause of |accid paralysis (see Chapter 60).
- C. tetani causes tetanus, a cause of rigid paralysis (see Chapter 59).
- C. difScile is a frequent cause of hospital-associated diarrhea or diarrhea that develops after receiving antibiotics ( C. difScile -associated diarrhea [CDAD]).
- possible and clinically indicated if a patient develops C. difScile -associated illness. Patients with CDAD should be treated with oral vancomycin or oral or intravenous metronidazole; additional agents may also be effective.

and  their  associated  syndromes  have  worldwide  distribution. C. perfringens is frequently present in contaminated raw meat and poultry. C. difScile is commonly present in soil and in the hospital environment.  In  many  hospitals  in  industrialized  countries, C. difScile gastroenteritis  has  become  a  major  infection  control challenge. 1

============================================================
CHUNK 19
============================================================
NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
C. perfringens -associated enteritis occurs when foods (usually beef, poultry, gravy, or dried or precooked foods) heavily contaminated with C. perfringens type A are ingested. Spores of C. perfringens can survive cooking; these spores germinate and multiply during slow  cooling  and  storage  at  temperatures  from  20°C  to  60°C. Infection  is  usually  acquired  at  banquets  or  institutions  where food is prepared in large quantities and kept warm for prolonged periods. The organism produces an enterotoxin in the colon, which causes crampy abdominal pain and diarrhea. Illness is not transmitted from person to person.
C. difScile is often present in hospitals and children's facilities, largely because of its ability to form spores that are resistant to many common disinfectants. It does not usually affect healthy individuals unless the normal intestinal |ora is disrupted by the use of antibiotics. C. difScile produces two primary toxins-A and B-which produce enterotoxic and cytotoxic effects, respectively. 2

============================================================
CHUNK 20
============================================================
CLINICAL FEATURES
C. perfringens -associated food poisoning usually occurs as part of an outbreak. The incubation period ranges from 6 to 24 hoursusually 8 to 12 hours. Major symptoms are crampy, mid-epigastric pain,  nausea,  and  non-bloody  diarrhea. Vomiting  and  fever are generally absent. In rare instances, a more severe form of enteritis occurs called enteritis necroticans . It is caused by C. perfringens type C that produces a beta toxin. Enteritis necroticans is characterized by abdominal cramps, vomiting, diarrhea (which may be bloody), shock, and acute in|ammation of the small intestine with areas of necrosis and gangrene. This condition is seen more often after
consumption of large quantities of contaminated meat by people who  generally  consume  low-protein  diets  and  hence  produce limited  amounts  of  digestive  proteases.  In  New  Guinea,  this condition  is  called pigbel  enteritis ,  where  it  is  associated  with traditional pig feasting activities in which large quantities of pork are consumed. 3
C. difScile causes a wide variety of gastrointestinal symptoms ranging  from  asymptomatic  colonization  or  mild  diarrhea  to pseudomembranous colitis, or even illness resembling an intraabdominal catastrophe. Pseudomembranous colitis is characterized by profuse watery diarrhea; abdominal cramps; fever; and small (2-5 mm), raised, yellowish plaques on the colonic mucosa.

============================================================
CHUNK 21
============================================================
PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
C. perfringens food poisoning is usually seen in the setting of an outbreak. The shorter incubation period (usually 8-12 hours) of C.  perfringens -associated  food  poisoning  and  complete  resolution of symptoms, usually by 24 hours, and absence of fever in most patients differentiates  this  syndrome  from  shigellosis  and salmonellosis. On the other hand, this incubation period is longer compared with some other causes of food-borne illnesses, such as heavy metal poisoning, Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin-associated food poisoning, and shell{sh toxins. The diarrheal illness caused by Bacillus  cereus enterotoxin  is  quite  similar  to  that  caused  by C. perfringens. Because the fecal |ora of healthy individuals often includes C. perfringens, counts of C. perfringens spores > 10 6 feces obtained within 48 hours of illness in acutely ill patients are required to presumptively con{rm the diagnosis. Enterotoxins can also be detected in the stool of affected individuals. In order to con{rm C. perfringens as a  cause of an outbreak, demonstration of large numbers of C. perfringens ( > 10 5 C. perfringens in the implicated food and the stools of affected individuals may be used.
C. difScile should be suspected in patients with diarrhea who have  received  antibiotics  in  the  previous  2  months  or  whose diarrhea  starts  72  hours  after  hospitalization.  T ypically,  toxin

KEY FEATURES
- Aeromonas spp. are gram-negative rods that can cause infections in healthy and immunocompromised hosts.
- Aeromonas hydrophila, A. caviae, and A. veronii ) are of clinical signi{cance.
- Aeromonas spp . are commonly distributed in animals and environmental sources. They favor aquatic environments, which probably are the main transmission source of human gastrointestinal infection.
- Aeromonas species, although causation and estimates of disease burden are controversial.
- Aeromonas spp. is usually self-limited, but cases of dysentery, cholera-like illness, and chronic diarrhea have also been associated.
testing  of  a  single  stool  specimen by  enzyme  immunoassay  or tissue  culture  assay  establishes  the  diagnosis.  However,  repeat testing may be required. Although C. difScile can be easily isolated from the stools by the use of selective media, distinction between toxigenic  and  non-pathogenic  strains  cannot  be  made,  and C. difScile can be isolated in the stool of many asymptomatic individuals.  Neonates,  young infants,  and  toddlers  are  very  commonly colonized with C. difScile, which may or may not produce toxins; however, C. difScile -associated diarrhea is rarely seen in this age group.

============================================================
CHUNK 24
============================================================
TREATMENT
C. perfringens is self-limited and does not require any speci{c therapy beyond oral rehydration or, in some cases, intravenous |uid and electrolyte replacement. Antispeci{c antitoxin to the beta toxin produced by C. perfringens type C offers signi{cant bene{t.
Treatment for C. difScile -associated disease requires discontinuation of the causative antibiotic regimen when feasible. Antibiotics against C. difScile are also indicated. Oral or intravenous metronidazole is the drug of choice for initial treatment of mild disease. Oral  vancomycin  has  been  shown  to  be  more  effective  than metronidazole but should be reserved for more severe or refractory cases,  as  it  may  increase  the  recovery  of  vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Intravenous vancomycin is not effective, as it does not enter the colonic lumen.

INTRODUCTION
Aeromonas are ubiquitous water-borne pathogens accountable for a wide spectrum of diseases. Aeromonas are commonly isolated in diarrheal specimens in tropical countries, but causation is controversial. Aeromonas species  can  cause  wound  infections  and septicemia.  They  exist  in  aquatic  environments  and  can  cause disease in amphibians, reptiles, and {sh. 1,2

============================================================
MICROBIOLOGY
Aeromonas are |agellated, facultative, anaerobic, non-spore-forming, catalase- and oxidase-positive, gram-negative rods in the family Aeromonadaceae.  Within  the  genus Aeromonas, there  are  two well-known phenotypically discrete groups: (1) non-motile and psychrophilic A. salmonicida and (2) mesophilic and motile aeromonads. 3 They grow optimally at temperature ranges of between 22°C and 35°C, but growth can also occur at 0°C to 45°C in a few species. 1 There are currently 17 recognized species of Aeromonas. Only three are of major clinical importance: A. hydrophila, A. caviae, and A. veronii. The other species are predominantly found in the environment. 4,5

============================================================
CHUNK 28
============================================================
EPIDEMIOLOGY
In 1961, Aeromonas spp. were {rst recognized as a cause of gastroenteritis in neonates during an outbreak of diarrhea in Colombia. 6 Cases of Aeromonasassociated diarrhea have since been described from many countries. 7,8 Historically the Aeromonas genus had been placed in the family Vibrionaceae , but now has been placed in its own family, the Aeromonadaceae. 9
A. hydrophila has been recognized as a pathogen of amphibians, reptiles, snails, cows, and humans. It has been found in soil, as well as a variety of aquatic environments, including lakes, rivers, streams, springs, rainwater, swimming pools, seawater, and tap water. Relative resistance to chlorine, unlike many other enteropathogens, is a potential public health hazard. Aeromonas have been isolated from a wide variety of foods, such as vegetables, raw milk, ice cream, meat, and seafood. Despite being prevalent in the environment, reported outbreaks of gastroenteritis caused by this organism are rare. There has been only one major outbreak in which Aeromonas has been implicated as the etiologic agent of disease. 10
Aeromonas are isolated with increased frequency during warmer months. Illness can occur in healthy and in immunocompromised hosts,  especially those with hematologic malignancies  and liver cirrhosis. Infections in immunocompromised individuals may be severe and associated with a high case fatality rate. 2,11

============================================================
CHUNK 29
============================================================
NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
Aeromonas can  form  bio{lms,  which  can  assist  in  adherence  in pipes  and  can  help  the  organism  survive  exposure  to  chlorine. Aeromonas secrete  at  least  two  hemolysins:  an  alpha  hemolysin causes hemorrhagic enteritis and increased |uid secretion in the rabbit ileum and is lethal if injected intraperitoneally in experimental animals; and a beta hemolysin, also known as aerolysin or cytotoxic toxin, encoded by the Act gene, has both hemolytic and cytotoxic activity. Both the alpha and beta hemolysins cause dermonecrosis if injected into animal skin. The enterotoxins secreted by Aeromonas have  been  broadly  divided  into  cytotonic  and  cytotoxic  types. Cytotonic enterotoxins are encoded by two genes, Ast (thermostable)  and Alt (thermo-labile),  which  are  genetically  different from cholera toxin but function by increasing secretion of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).
The cytotonic enterotoxin genes encoding Alt and Ast were found in 16% of isolates from diarrheal stools from Bangladeshi children, whereas the cytotoxic gene encoding Act was not identi{ed in any of the isolates. The presence of all three genes in clinical isolates may be associated with dysentery. 12-14

CHUNK 30
============================================================
CLINICAL FEATURES
Aeromonas species  have  been  associated  with  a  wide  variety  of intestinal as well as extraintestinal infections, although the burden of  diarrheal  illness  that  can  be  ascribed  to Aeromonas spp.  is controversial. Asymptomatic carriage, as well as failure to produce disease in healthy volunteers, has raised questions regarding its enteropathogenicity. 15
When Aeromonas spp . are  detected  in  diarrheal  stools,  the diarrhea is usually acute and watery, with patients having vomiting and abdominal pain. Aeromonas spp. may also be associated with dysentery, especially in children. 16,17 Cases with severe dehydrating cholera-like illness and rice-water stools associated with A. veroni biovar sobria and A. caviae have also been reported. These organisms have also been associated with traveler's diarrhea. In most cases, Aeromonas -associated diarrhea is self-limiting, but cases of chronic diarrhea have been reported. 18

============================================================
CHUNK 31
============================================================
CLINICAL FEATURES
Aeromonas have been implicated as causative agents in wound infections  and  can  cause  bacteremia  and  sepsis.  Pneumonia, meningitis, urinary tract infections, endocarditis, endophthalmitis, and bone and joint infections have also been reported. Wound infections  caused  by Aeromonas usually  occur  in  healthy  young individuals, typically on the extremities after trauma or abrasions. Infections  result  from  exposure  to  contaminated  water  or  soil. Cellulitis is the most common presentation of soft tissue infections caused  by Aeromonas, although  myonecrosis  (with  and  without gas production), rhabdomyolysis, and lesions mimicking ecthyma gangrenosum  have  been  reported. 19,20 Aeromonas species  were among the most commonly isolated organisms from tsunami victims with skin and soft tissue infections in southern Thailand in 2004. Many of these infections were polymicrobial. 21 Cases have also been reported after bites of snakes and reptiles, in burn patients, and after pelvic and abdominal surgeries. A. veronii biovar sobria is  a  normal  component of leech |ora, and wound infections in both adult and pediatric patients have been described after leech therapy. Aeromonads reside in the gut of the leech Hirudo medicinalis, where they contribute  in the enzymatic digestion of the blood ingested by the leech. Aeromonas septicemia mainly occurs in older males with underlying liver cirrhosis, malignancies, diabetes, or other underlying chronic infections. Mortality during Aeromonas -associated septicemia ranges from 24% to 68%. 22-24

PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Diagnosis can be made by isolation of Aeromonas spp. from clinical specimens in culture. Aeromonas spp. are oxidase-positive, glucosefermenting, gram-negative rods that are resistant to the vibriostatic NaCl broth concentrations help in identifying them from other oxidase-positive organisms like Vibrio and Plesiomonas. 25 They grow well on blood agar; MacConkey; and xylose, lysine, deoxycholate (XLD) agar.  Selective  media  incorporating  ampicillin  in  blood agar  (ABA)  can  be  used  to  aid  isolation  of Aeromonas species. index (API) 20E system or more sophisticated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. 11 Aeromonads are not routinely isolated in most microbiology laboratories as part of the normal protocol for isolating stool pathogens. Therefore it is important to notify the laboratory personnel when Aeromonas is suspected.
Aeromonas infection should be suspected in any patient with injuries and exposure to water, as well as in immunocompromised individuals with gram-negative shock, especially those with underlying liver disease.

TREATMENT
Aeromonas species are sensitive to tetracycline, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides (except streptomycin), and |uoroquinolones. Most species are resistant to ampicillin, ticarcillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and  {rst-generation  cephalosporins.  Increasing  antimicrobial resistance among Aeromonas species has been observed worldwide. The increasing resistance is not only caused by increased use of antibiotics in the clinical setting but also increasing use of antibiotics in animal husbandry and {sh farming. Chromosomally encoded, inducible β -lactamase  production  has  been  observed  among Aeromonas species. 26
Most diarrhea associated with Aeromonas species is self-limited be used in chronic diarrhea, dysentery, or diarrhea in travelers. Immunocompromised patients with Aeromonas diarrhea may be at increased risk of complications and may bene{t from treatment. |uoroquinolones can be used for empiric therapy, and antimicrobial susceptibility can guide further treatment decisions. 27,28 There are no clinical trial data to guide the duration of therapy; therefore treatment should be guided by clinical response.

PREVENTION AND CONTROL
Avoidance of raw and undercooked seafood consumption, provision of safe water supply for drinking, and good hygiene practices are essential preventive control measures to decrease the likelihood of Aeromonas infection. 29
