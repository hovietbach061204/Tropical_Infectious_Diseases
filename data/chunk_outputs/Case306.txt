INTRODUCTION
South American bartonellosis, or Carrion's disease, is a bi-phasic infection  caused  by Bartonella  bacilliformis and  transmitted  by sand|ies.  It  is  named  in  memory  of  Daniel  Alcides  Carrion,  a Peruvian medical student who self-inoculated the discharge from a patient with verruga peruana; Carrion subsequently died after developing the acute febrile-hemolytic phase of the illness. This act  demonstrated that  both  entities  were  manifestations  of  the same disease. 1

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Carrion's disease is endemic in the inter-Andean valleys (between 500  and  3200  meters  above  sea  level)  of  Peru,  Ecuador,  and Colombia. The disease has emerged in new areas in Ecuador and the high forests of Peru between the jungle margins and Altiplano. The expanding distribution is thought to re|ect changing weather and climate patterns (Fig. 73.1). 2 Serologic  studies suggest that about 60% of people in endemic areas have been infected and 0.5% may have asymptomatic bacteremia. 1 Bartonellosis affects males  and  females  equally  and  is  more  common  in  children. Pregnant  patients  can  develop  severe  complications;  vertical transmission from mother to fetus has been reported. 3

MICROBIOLOGY
B.  bacilliformis is  a  fastidious  intracellular,  pleomorphic,  gramnegative  bacterium.  Other Bartonella species, B.  rochalimae and B. ancashensis, may cause comparable illnesses. B. rochalimae was

Subsequently, it was isolated in domestic animals, supporting its potential zoonotic transmission. B. ancashensis was identi{ed by molecular testing in two patients with clinical verruga peruana who were enrolled in a clinical trial. 4,5

NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
Humans are the only known reservoir of B. bacilliformis. B. bacilliformis is transmitted by the bite of female New World sand|ies, Lutzomyia spp. The most effective vector in Peru is L. verrucarum that lives in high-altitude river valleys. After inoculation, B. bacilliformis infects the endothelium of multiple capillary vessels and then is released to the blood where it invades erythrocytes. This process  activates reticular-endothelial cells causing systemic symptoms and hemolysis. If the patient survives, approximately 5% develop the chronic phase of illness. In this stage, the bacterium invades the endothelial cells forming Rocha-Lima inclusion bodies, stimulating endothelial proliferation and  angiogenesis.  This response leads to formation of hyper-vascular nodules, similar to hemangiomas, called Peruvian warts . 6

CLINICAL FEATURES
Carrion's disease is characterized by two sequential clinical stages: a febrile-hemolytic illness (Oroya fever), followed by a verrucous phase (verruga peruana). However, infected individuals may manifest one of these two phases or have other clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic bacteremia to recurrent verrucous presentations. 7
The incubation period for Oroya fever is around 8 weeks, but may range from 10 days to months. Individuals present with fever, myalgia, headaches, and hepatomegaly. Severe pallor and jaundice secondary to hemolytic anemia are common. Pericarditis, encephalopathy, seizures, multi-organ failure, and death can occur. Also, B. bacilliformis infection has been described as a trigger for developing systemic vasculitis. Concomitant infectious complications are common, including salmonellosis, toxoplasmosis, histoplasmosis, tuberculosis, leptospirosis, and pneumocystosis. Oroya fever can last  for  1  to  4  weeks,  and  mortality  can  be  as  high  as  90%  in untreated patients and up to 10% in treated patients. 2,8,9
Verruga peruana occurs several weeks or months after the acute illness; patients present with arthralgia, fever, and painless eruptive lesions that  are  commonly  located on the face and  extremities. There are three types of lesions: miliary (multiple small, reddish papules  of  3 mm  or  less;  Fig.  73.2);  mular  (ulcerative  or  nonulcerative angioma-like tumors of more than 5 mm; Fig. 73.3); and a nodular or sub-dermic form (Fig. 73.4). Uncommonly, verruga can involve the oral, conjunctival, or nasal mucosa. Dermal verrugal lesions  usually  last  from  3  to  6  months  and  can  heal  without therapy. 7,10

PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Diagnosis  of  Oroya  fever  is  con{rmed  by  visualization  of  the intra-erythrocyte bacteria that may appear bacillary or coccoid in

peripheral blood Giemsa-Wright smear, or by isolation in blood cultures.  Peripheral  smear  is  frequently  used  in  endemic  areas due to its low cost, but it is insensitive (36%) and may be associated with misdiagnosis. Reliability of the test depends on the ability of the laboratory technician to distinguish the bacteria from artifacts, basophilic stippling, and Howell-Jolly bodies. Blood cultures should be held for up to 6 weeks, and recovery is highest using supplemented Columbia agar incubated at 28°C. 2,10,11
Diagnosis of verruga peruana is based on clinical features and con{rmed  by  histopathologic  analysis  of  tissue.  Microbiologic testing is insensitive in this stage. Proliferation of endothelial cells, macrophages,  and  angioblastic  proliferation  is  the  hallmark. Warthin-Starry and Giemsa staining permit visualization of the organism dispersed in tissue. Speci{c immunohistochemical staining has been developed. 12
Serologic tests (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA], sonicate immunoblot, and indirect |uorescence assay [IFA]) have shown high sensitivity in acute and  chronic disease.  Molecular techniques for diagnosis of Oroya fever can improve the diagnosis of  patients  with  low-level  bacteremia;  however,  assay  cost  and lack of molecular laboratories in endemic areas in Latin America limit its use. 2,13

PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The differential diagnosis of Oroya fever is broad, as individuals usually present with a non-speci{c febrile illness. Epidemiologic history and analysis of the potential incubation period are critical, as Carrion's disease is a geographically restricted infection. The presence of hemolytic anemia assists in considering the diagnosis, as well as malaria. The differential diagnosis of verruga peruana usually  involves  consideration  of  other  nodular  skin  lesions, although the hyper-vascular nature of verruga peruana assists in establishing the diagnosis (T able 73.1).

TREATMENT
In vitro studies have shown that B. bacilliformis is more susceptible to  penicillins,  cephalosporins,  tetracyclines,  |uoroquinolones, macrolides, rifampin, and chloramphenicol compared with aminoglycosides and carbapenems. 1,14
Because of the high rate of co-infection with Salmonella spp. during  the  acute  phase,  experts  recommended  cipro|oxacin  or chloramphenicol as a front-line therapy (T able 73.2). Cipro|oxacin became the therapy of choice as treatment failure and relapses were  observed  among  patients  treated  with  chloramphenicol. Limited observational and in vitro data have suggested intrinsic

resistance and reduced susceptibility to cipro|oxacin among some isolates; therefore for treatment of severe or persistent disease, a combination regimen of ceftriaxone and cipro|oxacin should be considered. Amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid may be used in pregnant women. Blood transfusions are indicated for patients with severe anemia; pericardial effusions may require drainage. 15,16
Azithromycin and rifampicin are equally effective for treating patients with verruga peruana, but azithromycin is favored due to  its  safer  side  effect  pro{le.  Cipro|oxacin  and  streptomycin are  alternatives.  Chloramphenicol  and β -lactam  penicillins  are ineffective. 1,17

Other Bartonella Infections
Beyond B.  bacilliformis, over  a  dozen Bartonella spp.  have  been identi{ed as causing diseases in humans,  including trench fever  (discussed  in  Chapter  72),  cat  scratch  disease  (CSD), bacillary  angiomatosis  (BA),  and  blood  culture-negative  endocarditis (BCNE).
CSD  is  considered  the  most  common Bartonella infection worldwide, affecting more children than adults. B. henselae is the main  etiologic  agent,  with  felines  being  its  principal  reservoir. B. henselae is transmitted to cats through |eas ( Ctenocephalides felis ). Human infection occurs after scratches, bites, or licks from infected cats or from the bite of an arthropod vector. CSD may present as a chronic papular, pustular, or ulcerative lesion that precedes a  painful, regional lymphadenopathy that usually is self-limited (Fig. 73.5), but 30% of cases present with systemic manifestations, including fever of unknown origin, lymphadenopathy, encephalitis, osteomyelitis,  hepatosplenic  abscesses,  retinitis,  and  Parinaud's oculoglandular syndrome. Diagnosis is con{rmed by IFA; cultures in  special  medium  and  histopathology  with  Warthin-Starry stain  can  be  used.  CSD  can  be  treated  with  azithromycin  or doxycycline. 12,18,19
BA  is  a  disorder  of  vascular  hyper-proliferation  caused  by B. henselae and B. quintana. The typical lesion is a reddish-purple papule,  but  may  be  a  hyperkeratotic  plaque  or  hyper-vascular nodule.  BA  is  seen  in  severely  immunocompromised  patients, especially in patients with AIDS. It can be con{ned to the skin or involve deep organs such as the liver, causing peliosis hepatis. Diagnosis is con{rmed by histopathology using Warthin-Starry or Giemsa stain. T reatment requires prolonged use of a macrolide, either alone or combined with doxycycline. 12,14,20
