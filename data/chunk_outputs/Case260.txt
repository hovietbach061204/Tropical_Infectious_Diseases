INTRODUCTION
Globally,  the  burden  of  acute  gastroenteritis  (AGE)  has  been decreasing steadily over the last two decades; from being the {fth most important cause of mortality across all age  groups in the year  2000,  AGE  ranked  eighth  in  2015,  with  the  number  of attributable deaths decreasing from 2.18 million to 1.39 million. However,  diarrhea  remains  the  second  most  common  cause  of death in low-income economies, responsible for 10% of the overall mortality and claiming 57.2 lives per 100,000 of the population each year (Fig. 34.1). Viruses account for the major proportion of causative agents responsible for AGE in both developing and developed countries. Acute diarrhea is the cardinal symptom of viral  gastrointestinal  infection  and  is  de{ned  as  the  passage  of three or more watery or looser-than-usual stools within the preceding 24 hours for less than 2 weeks' duration.
Viral  gastroenteritis  generally  presents  a  common  clinical picture,  requiring  laboratory  investigation  for  establishment  of

Signs and symptoms of typical acute viral gastroenteritis include acute onset of diarrhea, often with preceding vomiting, and sometimes with fever and abdominal pain. The most important complication is dehydration, and this requires oral or intravenous |uid replacement therapy, depending on the degree of dehydration. The disease typically lasts 3 to 5 days and is self-limiting. The viruses are transmitted feco-orally and infect the epithelial cells of the small intestine.  Damage to the villous epithelium of the small intestine affects the absorption of |uid and causes watery diarrhea. No in|ammation occurs, as the viruses multiply only within  the  enterocytes  in  the  intestinal  epithelium  and  do  not spread into the submucosa.
There are  currently  four  genera  and  one  species  of  viruses recognized as the main causes of viral gastroenteritis in humans: rotavirus, norovirus, sapovirus, astrovirus, and human adenovirus F (to which serotypes 40 and 41 belong and which are also referred to as enteric adenoviruses ). As these viruses are often shed in large numbers  into  stool  of  symptomatic  patients,  early  diagnostic approaches relied on the use of electron microscopy. However, molecular methods based on ampli{cation of the virus's nucleic acid that provide both high sensitivity and speci{city have now become the gold standard for virus detection. The major features of these gastroenteritis viruses are summarized in T able 34.1.

INTRODUCTION
Rotavirus  is  recognized  as  the  single  most  important  agent  of diarrhea  in  infants.  Before  the  rollout  of  vaccination,  rotavirus caused 37% ( ≈ 450,000) of diarrheal deaths and 5% of all deaths among children younger than 5 years of age. 1 Although a child will experience at least one rotavirus infection by 3 to 5 years of age in all settings, the consequence of infection is strikingly different between high- and low-income countries: {ve countries account for more than half of all deaths attributable to rotavirus infection, and India alone accounts for 22% of all deaths. 1
The recognition of this huge burden of rotavirus disease led to the development of rotavirus vaccines soon after its discovery in 1973 on thin-section electron microscopy of duodenal biopsies from a child with acute gastroenteritis (AGE). 2 The name rotavirus was coined due to its characteristic wheel-shaped ( rota is  Latin for wheel) morphology on electron microscopy (Fig. 34.1.1). The virus  is  a  double-stranded  RNA  virus:  genus Rotavirus, family Reoviridae. 3

The introduction of rotavirus vaccination programs has resulted in a signi{cant reduction in the global burden of diarrhea; it has been estimated that among children younger than 5 years of age, vaccination has resulted in a 67% and 38% reduction in rotavirus diarrhea and all-cause AGE hospitalizations, respectively. 4 Notably, rotavirus vaccine introduction has led to a halving of rotavirusattributable deaths in less than a decade. 5

============================================================
EPIDEMIOLOGY
Rotavirus infections occur worldwide. Most symptomatic infections occur in children between 3 months and 2 years of age. In temperate countries,  rotavirus infections  show winter seasonality, whereas infections occur year-round in most tropical countries. 6
Rotavirus spreads via the fecal-oral route, primarily through person-to-person  transmission.  Only  a  few  virus  particles  are required to infect the susceptible host.
Species A  rotaviruses  are  classi{ed  into  G  and  P  genotypes based on the sequence diversity of the RNA segments encoding the outer capsid proteins VP7 and VP4, respectively. 7 T o date, 32 G  genotypes  and  47  P  genotypes  have  been  described  among species A rotaviruses, and these can be found in different combinations. 3 Globally, G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8], G4P[8], G9P[8], and G12 in combination with P[6] or P[8] typically account for > 90% of  the  genotypes  that  infect  humans,  although  geographic  and temporal  differences  in  the  distribution  of  genotypes  are  well documented. 8-11 Immunization with the currently licensed vaccines provides cross-protection against commonly circulating strains, and  there  is  no  evidence  that  vaccination  has  resulted  in  the emergence of vaccine-escape strains. However, evidence suggests that vaccine ef{cacy is higher against vaccine-containing (homotypic) strains, and in the context of a highly reduced incidence of rotavirus diarrhea, strain distribution post-vaccine introduction may shift. 12-17

============================================================
CHUNK 9
============================================================
NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
Rotavirus infection occurs throughout life, and successive rotavirus infections commonly occur during infancy and early childhood. The {rst rotavirus infection typically results in the most severe disease outcome, although infection in the neonatal period often tends to be asymptomatic. 18 Subsequent rotavirus infections, irrespective of strain type, are associated with milder disease or may even be asymptomatic, although differences in the age of {rst infection and  number  of  infections  required  to  acquire  protection  from symptomatic disease vary according to population. T ypically, infants in low-income countries experience earlier infection and a larger number of symptomatic episodes. 19-21 Although severe disease is less common, rotavirus infection may nevertheless cause gastroenteritis in older children and adults, and the elderly appear to become more susceptible as their immunity wanes. 22-25 Since the introduction of rotavirus vaccines, there is evidence that rotavirus disease may be shifting to older ages. 26,27
Rotaviruses infect the duodenal mucosa and replicate in the mature enterocytes. The infection causes shortening and atrophy of the intestinal villi and enterocyte vacuolization and death that leads to impairment of the absorption of water and electrolytes from the lumen, contributing to osmotic diarrhea, which is followed by dehydration. 28 Additional mechanisms have also been proposed, such as expression of the rotavirus non-structural protein NSP4, which acts as an enterotoxin, and secretion mediated by the enteric nervous system 29,30 ; in addition, secretion of serotonin can activate signaling pathways that induce diarrhea and vomiting. 31,32

============================================================
CHUNK 10
============================================================
NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
Susceptibility  to  rotavirus  infection  is  determined  by  nonimmunologic factors such as the differential expression of genetically determined rotavirus receptors, histo-blood group antigens, 33-35 and immunologic factors. Antibodies and T cells play a critical role in protection against recurrent infection and virus clearance. This is clearly  demonstrated  by  the  failure  to resolve rotavirus infection, including infection with live-attenuated vaccine strains, in children with severe combined immunode{ciency. 36-38  Serum rotavirus-speci{c  immunoglobulin  A  (IgA)  antibody  levels  are currently the best marker of protection against rotavirus disease, and  the  presence  of  anti-rotavirus  IgA  antibodies  in  serum  is widely used as a marker of vaccine take, although the validity of this measure across populations remains to be demonstrated. 39-41

============================================================
CHUNK 11
============================================================
CLINICAL FEATURES
The onset of symptoms is abrupt after a short incubation period of 1 to 2 days. Fever, vomiting, and non-bloody watery diarrhea are seen in the majority of infected children and last for 2 to 6 days. The major complication is dehydration that appears shortly after the onset of disease and varies in severity. The cause of death after  rotavirus  infection  is  dehydration,  leading  to  metabolic disturbances and shock.
Rotavirus can enter the bloodstream, and both antigenemia and viremia have been described. 42-45 Despite the detection of rotavirus RNA in cerebrospinal |uid of infected children presenting with neurologic symptoms 46,47 and  the  association  of  neurologic  symptoms with rotavirus diarrhea, 48-50 direct evidence or speci{c pathologic {ndings of extra-intestinal disease caused by rotavirus are lacking.

============================================================
CHUNK 12
============================================================
PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The patient with AGE should {rst be evaluated for the presence and the degree of dehydration before seeking the etiology of the disease. It is not possible to distinguish rotavirus gastroenteritis from other viral or bacterial causes of non-in|ammatory diarrhea solely  on  clinical  grounds.  T o  establish  an  etiologic  diagnosis, stool specimens from the patient in the acute phase of the disease can  be  examined  by  a  variety  of  methods  for  the  presence  of rotavirus.  Antigen  detection  is  currently  the  most  widely  used method; immuno-chromatographic assays have been developed that  can be  used at the point of  care. However, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  (ELISA) offers  a  low-cost,  sensitive,  and speci{c  approach  for  the  diagnosis  of  acute  rotavirus  diarrhea, and is the most commonly used method for rotavirus detection in routine clinical practice.
Molecular methods that rely on the detection of rotavirus RNA in stool samples are also widely available, often as part of a multipathogen syndromic diagnostic approach. 51,52 Reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) offers both high sensitivity and  speci{city;  however,  RT-PCR  can  detect  the  presence  of rotavirus  in  asymptomatically  infected  individuals,  as  rotavirus can be shed for prolonged periods after acute infection. Because rotavirus load in stool correlates with disease severity, the use of a  viral  load  cut-off  is  advisable  when  applying  quantitative  or semi-quantitative RT-PCR for rotavirus diagnosis. 53,54

CHUNK 13
============================================================
TREATMENT AND PREVENTION
The mainstay of therapy for dehydration associated with rotavirus gastroenteritis consists of oral rehydration with |uids of speci{ed electrolyte  and  glucose  composition. 55 Intravenous  rehydration therapy is indicated for the patient with severe dehydration, shock, or reduced level of consciousness.
Dietary management is important in the care of children with acute diarrhea, and breastfeeding as well as the maintenance of adequate protein-calorie intake using age-appropriate foods should be encouraged. 56 Zinc supplementation can improve the outcome of acute diarrhea in populations in which malnutrition is common, and the  World Health Organization (WHO) recommends daily zinc supplementation for infants starting as soon as the diarrhea episode

Some studies have suggested modest bene{ts associated with the  use  of  probiotics,  reducing  the  duration  of  rotavirus  diarrhea  by  1  to  2  days. 57-62 Use  of  anti-emetics  (metoclopramide, dimenhydrinate, and ondansetron) for the treatment of rotavirus disease  is  not  widely  recommended  despite  a  small  number  of studies suggesting a reduction in the number of vomiting episodes and a reduced need for intravenous rehydration and hospitalization. 62 Other  potential  therapies  for  rotavirus  gastroenteritis, including racecadotril, octreotide, 63 or broad-spectrum antivirals such  as  nitazoxanide  have  reported  mixed  results  and  do  not substantiate  their  use  for  the  routine  treatment  of  rotavirus diarrhea. 64-69
Personal hygiene measures, such as handwashing, safe disposal of feces, and disinfection of contaminated surfaces, are important in reducing the risk of transmission.
Two rotavirus vaccines are used worldwide: RotaT eq (Merck, USA), and  Rotarix (GlaxoSmithKline,  Belgium)  (T able  34.1.1). Both vaccines are live attenuated and are highly ( > 90%) effective in preventing severe rotavirus disease in high-income countries, 70,71 but ef{cacy is reduced in low-income countries to ≈ 50% to 60%. 72-74 Although factors that determine this difference in ef{cacy are not fully understood, the impact of rotavirus vaccination is greater in low-income countries, saving more infant lives due to the higher rotavirus diarrhea burden in these countries.
Other live  attenuated  rotavirus  vaccines  are  in  use  in  some countries,  and  various  others  are  in  development,  including  a non-replicating  parenteral  vaccine.  Current  data  suggest  that live  attenuated  vaccines,  regardless  of  strain  composition,  have similar  ef{cacy  and  effectiveness  and  confer  comparable  levels of  cross-protection  against  a  variety  of  rotavirus  genotypes (Box 34.1.1).
