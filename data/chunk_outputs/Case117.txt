Key features
- Heat-associated illnesses are a spectrum of clinical syndromes ranging from minor heat exhaustion to life-threatening conditions characterized by rhabdomyolysis, renal failure and encephalopathy
- In the tropics, loss of shade trees, droughts, intense solar exposure and high humidity increase the incidence and severity of heat illness
- Hydration status, extremes of age, comorbidities and the use of certain traditional remedies, pharmaceuticals and alcohol can all impair physiologic cooling mechanisms, leading to heat illness
- Heat waves, or the combined e ects of high heat, high humidity and lack of potable water and cool havens, may cause mass-casualty incidents that may overwhelm local medical resources
- Treatment of heat illness in the tropics requires an understanding of the physiology of heat load and heat loss, heightened clinical vigilance and prompt, e ective use of cooling therapies

DEFINITION
Heat illnesses result from an imbalance of metabolic heat production or  environmental  heat  loading  and  inadequate  heat  dissipation [1].  In  healthy  adults,  thermoregulation  dissipates  metabolic  and exogenous heat to maintain core body temperatures between 36°C and  37.8°C.  Extreme  heat  loads  can  overwhelm  thermoregulatory responses, resulting in heat illness. Heat illness syndromes should not be confused with fever, which is a physiologic increase in the temperature set point of the body, or with malignant hyperthermia - a hereditary metabolic hyperthermic response to certain pharmaceuticals or anesthetic gases. If overheating continues and the patient is left untreated,  milder  forms  of  heat  illness,  such  as  heat  edema,  may progress to more severe manifestations of heat illness, such as heat stroke, which, if untreated, can have a case fatality rate of 63%. The key  syndromes associated  with different  heat  illnesses  are  listed  in Table 24-1.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Heat  illness  is  common  among  athletes,  soldiers,  foundry  workers and in the general population during mass gatherings in hot environments such as the annual Hajj pilgrimage [2, 3]. Among young athletes, the most severe form of heat illness - heat stroke - is the second leading  cause  of  death  [4].  In  tropical  regions,  heat  casualties  are common and may be increasing in developing economies as more workers are required to work under sweltering conditions. In many settings, inadequate access to cool havens or to cold, potable water increase the risk of heat illness. Epidemiologic studies on heat illness conducted in the USA and Europe [5, 6]indicate the groups at highest risk of heat illness are children under four years of age, the elderly, those with renal and endocrine disorders, and institutionalized and hospitalized patients [7, 8]. In particular, the  importance of sweatbased evaporative cooling is demonstrated by the higher incidence of heat  illness  in  the  elderly  and  in  patients  being  treated  with  anticholinergic medication [9, 10]. At this time, there are no convincing studies  demonstrating  differences  in  risk  of  heat  illness  between genders. Acclimatization to heat can reduce the risk of heat illness. Acclimatization involves near- and long-term physiologic adaptation; key  findings  include:  rapid  correction  of  water  loss  and  improved sodium preservation and gradual normalization of plasma electrolytes, altered blood perfusion to the skin, and reduced sodium concentrations in sweat and urine. New arrivals to tropical climes undergo limited acclimatization over a 2-4-week period; subsequent advances in acclimatization are both limited and not definitively proven by the current literature.

CHUNK 3
============================================================
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Heat illnesses are the result of excessive heat loads from the environment, the body's inability to dissipate heat or a combination of the two. In healthy individuals, the body compensates for heat stress by thermoregulatory  processes  and,  less  effectively,  through  adaptive processes. As total body heat load rises, a sensitive thermoregulatory system responds by stimulating the pre-optic nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus, which causes the dilation of cutaneous blood vessels and an increase in sweat production [1 1]. Familiarity with the mechanisms  of  heat  loss  allows  the  clinician  to  diagnose  impaired  thermoregulation and select the optimum cooling strategy for different patients and different treatment settings. There are four primary strategies that humans use to dissipate heat to the surrounding environment:  evaporation,  radiation,  convection  and  conduction.  Care providers  who  understand  these  mechanisms  of  heat  loss  are  well positioned to exploit these mechanisms to greater effect using focal cold  therapy.  The  major  form  of  heat  loss  in  hot,  dry  climates  is evaporation of sweat  or surface water from the skin or pulmonary system. Each of the four physical methods of heat loss is enhanced by compensatory physiologic processes such as increased sweat production, respiration and cardiac output, alterations in cutaneous and splanchnic blood flow, and reduction in physical activity. The physical mechanisms of heat loss are summarized in Table 24-2.
Physiologic thermoregulation expands upon physical mechanisms of heat loss through a combination of cutaneous vasodilation, increased sweat-based and  respiratory evaporative cooling, and  increased cardiac output. Environmental conditions greatly influence the efficiency of thermoregulation. For example, large temperature gradients between the body and surrounding air, convective loss from increased air movement, and low humidity all favor efficient cooling. Evaporative heat loss is limited by humidity greater than 75% and by impaired physiologic  responses  such  as  anhidrosis,  perfusion  abnormalities, low cardiac output and the effect of certain medications or ingested

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
TABLE 24-1, 1 = Clinical Spectrum of Heat Illness. Syndromes, 1 = Clinical features. Heat Edema, 1 = Self-limiting swelling of hands and feet resulting from cutaneous vasodilation and dependent pooling of interstitial Cuid; resolves with early acclimatization.. Heat Rash (miliaria), 1 = Pruritic, red vesicles found on skin covered by non-breathable clothing or sleeping pads. Occlusion of eccrine sweat ducts by keratinocytes leads to dilation and rupture. Secondary infection with bacteria including (in recent years) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is common. Repeated occlusion of sweat ducts results in progression of inCammation and if untreated, chronic dermatitis.. Heat Cramps, 1 = Cramping of large muscle groups following exercise; common in un-acclimatized individuals and those unaccustomed to physical exercise in hot conditions. The syndrome is attributed to ineDcient sodium recovery and hypernatremic sweat; resolves with acclimatization.. Heat Tetany, 1 = Hyperthermia-associated hyperventilation causes a primary respiratory alkalosis which in turn can cause perioral paresthesia, carpopedal or laryngeal spasm and Chvostek's sign.. Heat Exhaustion, 1 = Danger: symptoms include nausea, vomiting, fatigue, weakness and occasionally, diarrhea; clinical Endings include orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, syncope, hyperthermia (core temperature < 40 °C; 104 °F) and minor mental status changes such as poor attention span. Caution: Heat exhaustion and heat stroke have overlapping symptoms; the primary diFerentiating criterion is that heat stroke is associated with more severe CNS disturbances and core body temperatures above 40 °C.. Heat Stroke, 1 = Life-threatening: heat stroke is a medical emergency characterized by core temperature > 40 °C (105 °F) and CNS disturbances in patients with a history of heat exposure. Anhidrosis (absence of sweating) is often present but is no longer a criteria for diagnosis. Heat stroke occurs when thermoregulation fails completely leading to organ dysfunction and death. Caution: heat stroke is often missed in patients who may not have been physically active.

toxins. Other major methods of heat loss, such as radiation of infrared energy from the skin, conduction of heat through contact with surrounding materials and convective heat loss, are less efficient when environmental temperatures are higher than skin temperatures. The body also has a limited ability to acclimatize to heat stress through increased shunting of blood to the skin, improved water preservation and increased aldosterone production to retain sodium. Unacclimatized individuals exposed to heat stress initially have high urine and sweat  sodium  content  which  reduces  circulating  plasma  volume. Reduced  renal  blood  flow  from  sodium  and  water  loss  stimulates aldosterone secretion which increases plasma sodium levels which,
TABLE 24-2, 1 = Physical Heat Loss. Evaporation, 1 = Evaporative cooling aids the eDciency of cutaneous heat transfer to the environment and is the primary mechanism of heat loss in healthy individuals. Evaporative cooling through respiration is critical for dogs upon which many classic heat stroke studies are based, but appear to be much less signiEcant in humans compared to evaporation from the skin.. Conduction, 1 = Conduction is heat transfer through contact with a cooler material; the eDciency of conductive heat transfer varies with the properties of the conductive material, the temperature diFerential between surfaces and surface area. Conductive heat loss is improved when contact surfaces are of dense composition, contiguous or wet.. Radiation, 1 = Radiation is the loss of heat energy as electromagnetic waves, and accounts for up to 65% of total heat loss for temperatures < 37 °C. When environmental temperatures are higher than body temperatures, the direction of heat exchange is reversed, resulting in a net heat gain. Convection, 1 = Convection is the loss of heat to surrounding air; as with radiation, the direction of heat transfer reverses when the air temperature is higher than the skin temperature.

in  turn,  increases  intravascular  fluid  volume  [12].  Under  extreme physiologic conditions and high heat stress, vasodilation can be significant, leading to peripheral venous pooling, extravasation of fluids and reduced cardiac output. At temperatures above 42°C (~108°F), mitochondrial  enzymes  are  inactivated,  oxidative  phosphorylation becomes uncoupled and ischemia of hepatocytes and renal parenchymal cells occurs. Heat damage to hepatorenal vascular beds results in microthrombi formation and prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial  thromboplastin time  (PTT); if cooling is  not  instituted, disseminated intravascular coagulation can occur, leading to multi-organ system failure and death [1, 13].

CHUNK 7
============================================================
ASSESSMENT AND INVESTIGATIONS
The first priority in patient assessment is to confirm airway, breathing and circulation. Care providers should ensure that the patient is protected  from  further  heat  exposure.  While  assessment  is  underway, equipment and personnel should be recruited to assist with cooling. Appropriate initial steps include removal of clothing and preparation of  cold  water  baths,  water  mist-convection  systems  and  venous cooling  dressings.  Critically  overheated  patients  may  require  more aggressive procedures, such as peritoneal lavage. If initial assessment suggests either heat exhaustion or heat stroke, peripheral intravenous access should be established and normal saline or lactated Ringers should be initiated at  200 ml/h.  If  available,  unhumidified  oxygen should be delivered by nasal cannula.
Initial work-up starts with a detailed history and thorough physical exam. If the patient is critically overheated, baseline vital signs should be obtained and re-assessed at 15-minute intervals; sphygmomanometer  sites  should  be  marked  with  indelible  ink  to  ensure  accurate measurements are obtained between  care  providers.  Baseline  body temperature needs to be established using a quality non-glass medical thermometer. Temperature measurements from axillary and inguinal sites are unreliable; however, they can be used to monitor trends in body  temperature  if  rectal  measurements  are  unsafe.  If  prolonged resuscitation is anticipated, a medical thermo-resistor probe should be placed in the rectum or esophagus. If none is available and the situation is dire, an inexpensive outdoor thermometer can be adapted

ASSESSMENT AND INVESTIGATIONS
for  invasive  monitoring  by  covering  the  probe  with  a  prophylactic condom or glove and inserting the lead immediately beyond the anal verge. Continuous core temperature monitoring offers advantages in austere environments as monitoring will dictate triage  priority and can  be  maintained  during  all  phases  of  prehospital  and  hospital management.  Mental  status  and  the  presence  of  focal  neurologic problems should be assessed next. The cerebellum is highly sensitive to  heat  stroke  and  therefore  finger-nose-finger  or  other  exam  to assess  dysdiadochokinesia  and  cerebellar  function  should  be  performed. The oral cavity should be examined for evidence of gingival bleeding and the stool assessed for hemoglobin-positive results which may herald early coagulopathy. Pulmonary exam should assess for rales. Skin exam will help determine the patient's hydration status and the  presence  of  miliaria.  Muscle  exams  should  include  active  and passive flexion of shoulders, thighs and calves; the presence of localized pain may indicate muscle breakdown. Urine should be collected by  a  Foley  if  necessary  and  inspected  for  evidence  of  myoglobin, hemoglobin and sediment. Disposable urine analysis 'dip-sticks' are useful in the field as results guide rehydration and may aid detection of hemoglobinuria or myoglobinuria. In recent years, the proliferation of cartridge-based handheld blood chemistry units in field clinics increases the probability that basic blood chemistry may be obtained. The  current-generation  cartridges for  these  hand-held  units  require refrigeration; if test results are inconsistent with the clinical picture, the provider should suspect that the cartridges are outdated. If conventional coagulation studies are not possible, a whole-blood clotting assay can be used to assess for coagulopathy and a Weintraub sedimentation tube can be used  to  assess for  hemoconcentration.  The improvised coagulopathy and hemoconcentration tests discussed are most accurate when conducted with 'controls' provided by a healthy bystander. Table 24-3 summarizes laboratory tests that are helpful in assessing heat illness casualties.

DIAGNOSIS
The  differential  diagnosis  of  heat  illness  requires  a  history  of  heat exposure,  a  detailed  physical  exam  and  bedside  studies.  Infectious etiologies and rare causes of hyperthermia need to be ruled out. The differential diagnosis should include malignant hyperthermia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, endocrine and hypothalamic disorders, and fictitious hyperthermia. Heat edema and heat syncope are suggested by advanced patient age, deconditioning, low cardiac reserve and recent arrival in the tropics from cooler regions. Miliaria, a distinct heat dermatosis, is differentiated from other tropical skin maladies  by  the  timing,  distribution  and  physical  appearance  of  skin vesicles.  Miliaria  responds  promptly  to  antihistamines  or  dilute topical chlorhexidine. Heat cramps are a second common malady in unacclimatized individuals;  diagnosis  is  suggested  by  resolution  of cramps with rest and cool treatment, stretching and fluids, and electrolyte  repletion.  The  two  most  dangerous  heat  illnesses  -  heat exhaustion and heat stroke - have overlapping clinical features and are discussed in greater detail below.

Heat exhaustion is an imprecise clinical syndrome characterized by nonspecific findings unified under a history of heat exposure. Core body temperature for heat exhaustion is < 40°C. Common symptoms include  nausea  and  vomiting,  headache  and weakness.  Respiratory rate  may  be  elevated.  The  cardiac  and  pulmonary  exam  may  be normal; however, tachycardia may be present from concomitant dehydration. The presence of sweating in heat exhaustion patients is an important finding as it is frequently  absent in heat stroke patients. The  patient's  mental  status  may  suggest  mild  confusion  and  complaints may include dizziness. Symptoms of heat exhaustion tend to resolve with any modest interventions that lower body temperature.
Heat  stroke  is  a  life-threatening  condition  defined  by  a  core  body temperature > 40°C and mental status or neurologic symptoms that do not respond to initial therapy (rest, cold treatment and hydration) [13]. Patients may be combative, with delirium, seizure, obtundation or coma. Clues to differentiate early heat stroke from heat exhaustion include significant  mental  status  changes,  diarrhea  and  dry  skin  in heat  stroke.  A  minority  of  heat  stroke  casualties  may  present  with sweating; however, this usually stops as thermoregulation continues to fail. Complications of heat stroke include acute renal failure from rhabdomyolysis, liver failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), seizure, coma and death [1].

CHUNK 14
============================================================
MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOMES
Treatment  of  heat  illness  is  provided  in  Table  24-5.  Management strategies exploit all four principal mechanisms of heat loss and cold therapy targeted to specific body locations (see Fig. 24.1). Minor heat illnesses  are  self-limiting  if  the  patient  is  provided  with  fluids,  rest and access to a cool environment. The majority of cases require only fluids  and  electrolytes  for  resolution  of  symptoms.  Heat  edema  is prevented by exercise programs prior to travel to the tropics, optimization of diuretics and beta-blockers, and use of supportive compressive stockings.
Heat exhaustion is a more serious form of hyperthermia that requires close evaluation. Initial treatment of patients includes documentation of core temperature, assessment of blood chemistries, and treatment using  hydration,  moisture  to  the  skin-preferably  with  convective cooling and oral electrolyte solutions. If symptoms are more severe or mental status changes are noted, the patient should be treated with intravenous normal saline. Both normal and abnormal serum chemistries  should  be  rechecked  after  hydration  and  urine  output  is restored. Patients should be monitored until core body temperature has  normalized.  Heat  exhaustion  patients  who  have  persistent  or worsening  mental  status  changes  should  have  core  temperature rechecked to confirm the diagnosis, and should receive more aggressive and prolonged cold treatment.
The  treatment  for  heat  stroke  requires  prompt,  aggressive  physical cooling.  All  measures  for  dissipating  heat  should  be  maximized: evaporation,  radiation,  convection  and  conductive  cooling.  Treatment of heat stroke in the tropics may be limited by inadequate water for  cooling  baths,  unavailability  of  air-conditioning  and  unreliable electricity to power fans. Patient monitoring during treatment may be

complicated by lack of quality thermometers or supportive laboratory tests.  One  frequently  overlooked  issue  is  that  the  conditions  that caused one heat casualty are very likely to cause a large number of casualties. Initial assessment of a solitary heat illness casualty should therefore consider how local medical resources may efficiently scale to treat a large number of patients.

============================================================
CHUNK 15
============================================================
MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOMES
Of the available methods, evaporative cooling is the most available and scalable treatment for field management. Unlike water immersion and invasive techniques such as peritoneal lavage, evaporative cooling allows for constant patient monitoring, the use of additional cooling strategies and the scalability to treat multiple patients at one station. Evaporative cooling requires water to apply to the skin and an  air  movement  source,  such  as  an  electric  fan.  The  patient  is undressed and placed supine close to the fan. The skin is moistened with water using a sponge or mist bottle. If local cultures, mores or religious beliefs prevent disrobing, the patient may be covered with a thin sheet that is kept wet; however, this dramatically reduces evaporative heat loss. Patients cooled with convective mist water systems need to  be re-assessed regularly to ensure stable correction of body temperatures. Alcohol and other low vapor pressure fluids should not be applied to the skin as dilated cutaneous blood vessels may increase absorption, leading to intoxication. In many tropical clinics the only resources available for cooling the patient are ice packs: if supplies are limited, cold packs should be applied directly to large superficial veins on flexor surfaces such as the anticubital and popliteal fossa, axilla and inguinal region. If ice is used, it should be wrapped in a damp cloth and applied to superficial veins using non-compressive pressure (see Fig. 24.1). Current-generation chemical cold packs lack adequate cold capacity to treat heat casualties; however, they should be used if nothing else is available.
Cold (ice) water immersion is the most effective method for rapid cooling.  Clinical  experience  indicates  ice  water  immersion  lowers

MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOMES
body  core  temperature  at  twice  the  rate  of  convective  mist-water cooling  (mist  water  and  electric  fan).  The  advantage  of  cold  water baths is  that  the rate of cooling can be controlled by changing the water temperature or the amount of body surface area in the water. In immersion cooling, the patient is undressed and placed in a tub of suitable depth to allow water to cover the extremities; cold immersion should only be used on alert patients. Heat stroke patients and those with comorbidities, such as underlying cardiac disease, should be monitored for arrhythmias or syncope and, if the situation is not critical, cooled using less aggressive methods. In developed regions, immersion cooling has fallen out of favor because of difficulties with patient telemetry.  In  refugee camps, however,  a  water bath is often constantly in use to treat heat illnesses.

============================================================
CHUNK 17
============================================================
MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOMES
Invasive  cooling  techniques  are  only  to  be  used  when  cold  water misting, evaporative cooling and cool water immersion are ineffective and the patient is critically overheated. Invasive cooling may correct temperature unevenly and result in unpredictable cooling rates, overcooling and possibly death. Current invasive cooling methods include gastric  and  peritoneal  lavage  with  cold  fluids,  cooled  intravenous fluids and cooled inhalational gas. The use of ice water gastric lavage is contraindicated in patients who have altered mental status or who are unable to protect their airway. Heat casualties with life-threatening elevated core temperatures and for whom gastric lavage is attempted should be  intubated to protect  the  airway.  Cold  intravenous  fluids require careful control, as proximal access  and rapid infusion  rates can induce cardiac arrhythmias. Cold peritoneal lavage is an invasive technique  that  requires  sterile  access  and  should  not  be  used  in patients suspected of having abdominal adhesions or who are pregnant. Cooled oxygen and oral hydration fluids lack the cold capacity necessary to justify use in emergency treatment. One new technology that has proven valuable to soldiers and athletes in hot climates is a small,  portable  vacuum  cooling system known  as 'cooling gloves' . This device consists of a negative pressure chamber for the hand and a  small  pump  that  circulates  cold  water  to  a  handle.  The  hand  is inserted into the chamber and grabs the handle. Air is then pumped out of the chamber, causing the vascular beds of the palm of the hand to be splinted open. Heat from the core is transmitted through the enlarged vascular bed to the cold conductive surface of the handle, resulting in rapid cooling of the body. A commercial vacuum cooling glove is illustrated in Figure 24.2.

============================================================
CHUNK 18
============================================================
MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOMES
Regardless of the cooling method used, care providers should continuously monitor core temperature to ensure cooling does not overshoot the desired temperature [16]. In cases involving rapid cooling of the core, treatment should be interrupted when core temperature drops below 40°C. The objective is to drop core temperature into a range where normal thermoregulation can again take control. Adjunct treatments that complement therapeutic cooling are limited. Dehydration  is  treated  quickly  with  intravenous  fluids  or,  in  conscious patients, with water or sports drinks. Sports drinks should be diluted before  use  to  prevent  osmotic  loading  of  the  gastrointestinal  (GI) tract,  which, in turn, can cause GI distress. Antipyretic medications and drugs used to treat malignant hyperthermia have no value in the treatment of heat illnesses and should not be used [14]. One common complication  of  effective  cooling  with  ice  packs  or  immersion  is shivering, which generates more body heat. In these situations, the careful use of short-acting benzodiazepines is reasonable. Although chlorpromazine is also used to treat shivering, the secondary alpha-1 blocking activity may make hypotension worse and therefore should not be used.
FIGURE 24.2 Commercial vacuum cooling glove.
Successful management of heat illness requires prompt recognition, triage,  identification of exacerbating factors such as drug or alcohol ingestion, and efficient use of limited therapeutic cooling resources.
