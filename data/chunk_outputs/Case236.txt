INTRODUCTION
Dermatoses are a leading cause of health problems in returning travelers,  being  reported  in approximately 20% of ill patients. The most common dermatologic problems are skin and soft tissue infections (pyoderma,  cellulitis),  hookworm-related  cutaneous  larva  migrans (HrCLM), and reactions to arthropod bite or sting (with or without secondary infection) [1-3]. Amongst skin disease in returned travelers,  imported  disease  accounts  for  24%  to  54%  of  cases.  Approximately 10% of the patients are ill enough to be hospitalized [1].

APPROACH TO A TRAVELER WITH A SKIN LESION
The patient's history should systematically evaluate the type of travel, use of preventive measures, risk exposure, and history of similar signs and symptoms in fellow travelers. The dermatologic history will focus on the initial presentation and onset relative to potential exposures, the progression of lesions, and their duration.
Clinical examination will focus on the morphologic characteristics of the lesions (papule, nodule, vesicle, bullous, plaque, ulcer, creeping dermatitis) (Fig. 147.1) together with their anatomic distribution (i.e. localized, generalized or limited to a specific anatomic location) and the presence of pruritus. Any associated local and systemic signs and symptoms  will  need  to  be  taken  into  account.  Further  diagnostic procedures may be warranted according to the findings of the clinical examination.

============================================================
SKIN AND SOFT TISSUE INFECTION
Bacterial skin infections are the most common skin diseases observed in returned travelers [4]. The clinical spectrum ranges from impetigo and abscess to erysipelas and necrotizing cellulitis [1,3,5]. Infections are usually due to Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) and/or Staphylococcus aureus . Arthropod bites or stings can become superinfected with the bite  acting  as  a  portal  of  entry  (Fig.  147.2)  or  becoming  infected secondary to scratching.
The clinical presentation provides clues toward a specific microbial agent. Impetigo (Fig. 147.3) (presenting as bullae, pustules or postbullous erosions) is more often due to S. aureus than to Streptococcus spp.  [1,5].  Ecthyma  (Fig.  147.4)  (presenting  as  a  crusted  lesion)  is more likely secondary to S. pyogenes [5]. Folliculitis, carbuncles, and abscesses  (Fig.  147.5)  are  almost  exclusively  due  to S.  aureus [5]. Erysipelas and cellulitis (Fig. 147.6) are more likely due to S. pyogenes but other bacteria ( S. aureus , anaerobes, Aeromonas hydrophila , Vibrio vulnificus,  Pasteurella spp.)  should  be  considered in  the  case  of dog bite or marine envenomation, for example.
S. aureus may be either methicillin-resistant (MRSA) or methicillinsensitive  (MSSA).  Both can  carry the  gene  of  the  Panton-Valentine leukocidin  (PVL),  a  cytotoxin  that  confers  higher  morbidity.  PVLpositive S.  aureus strains  acquired  abroad  can  be  transmitted  after arrival home [4]. S. pyogenes remains sensitive to penicillins [5].

CREEPING DERMATITIS
Creeping  eruption  is  defined  as  a  linear  or  serpiginous  cutaneous track that is slightly elevated, erythematous and migrating (Fig. 147.7). The clinical characteristics of the cutaneous trail (length, width, speed of migration, location, duration) help to differentiate between causes. Hookworm-related cutaneous larva migrans (HrCLM) caused by penetration of the skin by nonhuman (cat, dog) hookworm larvae is the most common cause of creeping dermatitis [6]. HrCLM is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical countries worldwide and is usually acquired while lying or walking on the beaches in hot seaside  areas,  particularly  in  Southeast  Asia  or  the  Caribbean.  The striking symptom of  HrCLM is pruritus localized at the site  of  the eruption and the clinical sign is creeping dermatitis. Edema or local swelling and vesiculobullous lesions along the course of the larva are reported in approximately 10% of the patients. Hookworm folliculitis is a particular form of HrCLM (Fig. 147.8).
The most frequent anatomic locations of HrCLM are the feet followed by  the  buttocks  and  thighs.  Without  any  treatment,  the  eruption usually lasts weeks. Creeping eruptions may also be seen in diseases involving  non-hookworm larvae (e.g. 'larva currens' of strongyloidiasis),  maggots,  adult  nematodes,  trematode  larvae,  and  mites (Box 147.1).
Oral  ivermectin  (200 μ g/kg,  single  dose)  and  albendazole  (400  to 800 mg per  day,  according  to  weight,  for  3  days)  are  the  first-line

treatments of HrCLM. Taken in a single dose, ivermectin is well tolerated and highly efficacious with cure rates of 94-100% in all but one of the largest series [6].

============================================================
CUTANEOUS ULCER
Beside pyodermas, the main cause of cutaneous ulcer  is cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) (Fig. 147.9). Old World CL (caused primarily by Leishmania  major and L.  tropica )  usually  occurs  in  travelers  to  subSaharan and North Africa, the Mediterranean basin, and the Middle East. New World CL (caused primarily by species of L. braziliensis and L. mexicana complexes) usually occurs in travelers to the forested areas of South and Central America. The clinical forms of CL also include papules, nodules, plaques and nodular lymphangitis [4]. The average number  of  cutaneous  lesions  varies  from  one  to  three  and  rarely exceeds ten per patient. Usual features of CL include return from an endemic country in  the New  or Old  World,  anatomic  location  on exposed skin (face, arms, legs), absence of pain, chronicity (more than
1 month duration), and failure of antibiotic treatment (which is often prescribed to treat 'pyoderma').
Other causes of cutaneous ulcer in returned travelers include inoculation eschars seen during rickettsioses (e.g. African tick bite fever) (Fig. 147.10),  the  early  stage  of  African  trypanosomiasis  (trypanosomal chancre) (Fig. 147.1 1), and less commonly, cutaneous anthrax. Sporotrichosis and Buruli ulcer (cutaneous manifestation of Mycobacterium  ulcerans infection)  more often present  as chronic lesions (Box 147.2).

============================================================
FIXED LOCALIZED PAPULES AND NODULES
There are several causes of fixed papules and nodules (Box 147.3). Myiasis  and  tungiasis  are  among  the  most  common.  Myiasis  is infestation of human tissue by larvae or maggots of flies ( Diptera ). Furuncular  myiasis  (caused  by Cordylobia  anthropophaga in  subSaharan Africa and Dermatobia hominis in Central and South America)

gives rise to a papule then a nodule with a central punctum, and the patient typically complains of a crawling sensation inside the lesion. Cases due to Cochliomyia hominivorax , Oestrus ovis , C. ruandae and C. rodhani have been seen [4].
Tungiasis is caused by penetration of the gravid female sand flea Tunga penetrans , which burrows into the skin of its host, usually on the feet or a toe, where it appears as a slowly growing nodule. The infection is acquired via direct contact (e.g. bare feet) with infested soil or beach sand. Tungiasis (also called chigoe flea, jigger flea) is widely distributed throughout Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa and Asia up to the west coast of India [4].

============================================================
CHUNK 11
============================================================
Arthropod-Related Dermatitis
Arthropod-related dermatitis is caused by fleas, sand flies, chiggers, bedbugs, and less commonly mosquitoes, and mites. The bites can result in vesiculobullous lesions, cellulitis-like reactions, papular urticaria and prurigo. Identification of the implicated arthropod can be difficult but is without significant consequence as the treatment is the same. Corticosteroid-based ointments are indicated in mild to moderate cases, whereas systemic corticosteroids can be discussed in more severe  cases.  Oral  antihistamines  may  improve  the  symptoms.  An antibiotic is usually indicated if secondarily infected.

============================================================
CHUNK 12
============================================================
Contact Dermatitis
Allergic  contact  dermatitis  has  been  widely  reported  after  contacts with plants such as cashew nut tree, poison ivy/oak (poison ivy dermatitis), mango and pistachio. Irritant  contact dermatitis  has  been described after contacts with moths as well as nocturnal beetles of the genus Paederus . Paederus dermatitis, also called blister beetle dermatitis,  occurs  when  nocturnal  beetles  of  the  genus Paederus (rove beetles)  are  crushed  on  the  skin.  One  or  2  days  after  crushing  the insect and release of paederin, linear, erythematous plaques with a 'burnt' aspect, and the appearance of vesicles or pustules occurs [7]. The lesions are usually on the neck, face or arms. Contact with the conjunctiva and/or  cornea can induce  severe eye  disease  ('Nairobi eye'). In the case of irritant dermatitis, the irritant should be removed by washing.
Phytophotodermatitis is a cutaneous phototoxic reaction that occurs after contact with a variety of plant substances (e.g. limes, lemons) followed by sunlight exposure. The acute presentation is similar to sunburn  but  with  well-delimited  and  circumcised  erythema  and vesicles.  Secondarily  the  involved  skin  has  marked  hyperpigmentation [8].

============================================================
Dermatophytosis
Dermatophytes  are  distributed  worldwide  but  their  incidence  is higher in the tropics. They rank among the most common skin diseases  observed  after  travel  abroad  [2-4].  They  can  present  as  tinea corporis  (infection  of  the  non-hairy  glabrous  skin),  tinea  cruris and axillaris (infection of the groin or axillae), tinea of the feet (the most common dermatophytic infection) and tinea capitis (often in children returning from visiting friends and relatives or adopted in Africa) [4].

============================================================
CHUNK 14
============================================================
OTHER LOCALIZED DERMATOLOGIC SYNDROMES
The  most  frequent  cause  of  nodular  lymphangitis  (defined  by  the presence of  nodular and/or ulcerative lesions  distributed along the line of lymphatic drainage ) is leishmaniasis and bacterial lymphangitis. Localized erythematous edema can be due to a cellulitis-like reaction after an insect bite or a bacterial cellulitis [4]. Marine dermatitis or  envenomation can be traced to contact with jellyfish,  fire  coral, stone fish, sea anemones, urchins, or other sea creatures.

============================================================
CHUNK 15
============================================================
FEBRILE EXANTHEM
A febrile exanthem deserves particular attention because it can reveal potentially life-threatening disease (Box 147.4). The main etiologies are arboviruses, usually dengue fever, and rickettsioses, often African tick bite fever [9].
Chikungunya and dengue  rashes are difficult  to  differentiate;  both have  diffuse  (potentially  pruritic)  macular  or  maculopapular  exanthems in which small islands of skin are spared. Arthralgia is more frequent with chikungunya, and leukopenia and thrombocytopenia is more frequent in dengue [9]. Other less common arboviral diseases presenting with fever and rash (e.g. West Nile and O'Nyong Nyong) could be involved.
African  tick  bite  fever  (ATBF)  is  the  most  commonly  encountered rickettsiosis  in  travelers,  mostly  in  those  returning  from  rural  subequatorial Africa [4]. ATBF can occur in clusters of travelers exposed to Amblyomma ticks during game hunting, safaris, adventure races, and military exercises. Clinical presentation includes fever, headache, neck myalgia, one to several inoculation eschars (see Fig. 147.10), maculopapular or vesicular cutaneous rash, and regional adenopathy. It is usually a mild disease. Other rickettsioses that may be observed in travelers are Rocky Mountain spotted fever (in Americas), Mediterranean spotted fever (in Mediterranean Europe, Africa and Asia), scrub typhus (in rural south and southeastern Asia and the western Pacific), and murine typhus (in tropical and subtropical regions).
Other life-threatening infections include meningococcal disease, toxic staphylococcal  and  streptococcal  infection,  leptospirosis  and  other rickettsioses  [4,9].  Although  rare,  viral  hemorrhagic  fevers  (VHFs) such  as  Lassa,  Marburg  and  Ebola,  Rift  Valley  fever,  and  CrimeanCongo  hemorrhagic  fever,  have  been  reported  in  travelers  [4,10]. Yellow  fever  should  also  be  suspected  in  non-vaccinated  travelers returning from areas of endemicity.
Hypersensitivity reaction to drugs must always be considered in the diagnosis of fever and exanthem (see Fig. 147.9).

============================================================
CHUNK 16
============================================================
URTICARIA
Acute schistosomiasis (Katayama fever) is a leading cause of urticaria in a traveler [4]. Acute urticaria can also be seen during the invasive phase of other helminth infections such as ascariasis, strongyloidiasis or fascioliasis, whereas chronic urticaria is more often related to toxocariasis  and  trichinosis  (Box  147.5).  Hypersensitivity  reaction  to drugs and, less commonly, viral hepatitis A can be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute urticaria.

CHUNK 17
============================================================
BOX 147.5  Causes of Urticaria in Travelers
- Noninfectious causes: adverse drug reaction*
- Viral infection: hepatitis A infection
- Parasitic  infection:  invasive  phase  of  helminthic  diseases (ascariasis, hookworm, strongyloidiasis, anisakiasis, gnathostomiasis,  schistosomiasis*,  fascioliasis),  chronic  helminthic infections where humans are dead end host (trichinellosis,  toxocariasis)  and  rupture  of  cyst  during hydatid disease
*Common cause.

============================================================
CHUNK 18
============================================================
DISSEMINATED PRURITUS WITH OR WITHOUT RASH
Scabies is the most common cause of diffuse pruritic skin disease [4]. The patient complains of generalized and intense itching, worsening at  night,  usually  sparing  the  face  and  head.  Specific  skin  findings include 5- to 10-mm burrows, and papulonodular genital lesions. The classic  distribution of lesions are the interdigital web spaces, flexor surfaces of the wrists, the elbows, the axillae, the buttocks and genitalia, and on the breasts of women. Other skin changes are secondary to pruritus and include excoriation and lichenification.
Ciguatera is a cause of localized pruritic neurosensory manifestations (perioral and distal extremity paresthesias) without cutaneous manifestations. There should be a history of fish consumption, other cases among travelers sharing the  same  meal,  a  short  incubation  period
(2-30 hours), and the association of gastrointestinal and neurological signs. The latter can last for months after the initial event. This fish poisoning is acquired by the ingestion of fish containing the toxins produced by the dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus toxicus , which is found in damaged coral reef systems in tropical and subtropical regions.
Seabather's eruption (also called sea lice) is a highly pruritic maculopapular  eruption  that  occurs  after  swimming  in  the  ocean  and  is generally confined to the skin under swimwear. It is caused by larval forms of sea  anemones  (e.g. Edwardsiella  lineata )  and  jellyfish  (e.g. Linuche unguiculata ) that become trapped under swimwear.
Cercarial dermatitis (swimmer's itch) is also a pruritic maculopapular eruption but is predominantly distributed on uncovered body areas. It  results  from  penetration  of  the  skin  by  cercariae  of  nonhuman schistosomes while swimming in fresh water. It can last for several days.

============================================================
CHUNK 19
============================================================
DISSEMINATED PRURITUS WITH OR WITHOUT RASH
From the 'skin' point of view, travelers must be instructed to avoid arthropod bites, sun overexposure, walking barefoot, and scratching in  the  case  of  pruritus.  They  should  be  up-to-date  against  tetanus. Travel  first  aid  kits  should  include  insect  repellents,  corticosteroid ointments,  and  appropriate  dressings  and  bandages.  Travelers  can consider carrying antibiotics to treat streptococcal and staphylococcal skin infection.
