association with an epidemic of infection [4]. In this report, there was an association of exposure to beaver dams. However, this epidemic was more likely because of the presence of moist soil, highly enriched with  organic  material  that  provided  favorable  conditions  for  the organism to grow. In this outbreak, it was noted that many patients with  infection  did  not  have  signs  and  symptoms  characteristic  of blastomycosis, supporting the existence of subclinical or self-limited infection, as occurs in histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis.
Although there is no particular predisposition to developing blastomycosis, many patients have a history of recreational or occupational exposure to wooded areas, and often to soil associated with animals or bodies of freshwater such as lakes and rivers [1, 3]. A review of 1 1 14 cases from the literature revealed that 87% of patients were between 20 and 69 years of age [5]. The male to female ratio is at least 4  :  1, probably owing to differences in exposure risk [1]. While infection in children is rare, it is well documented [6].
Infection has occurred in dogs, cats, cows, and other mammals, but zoonotic spread to humans has not occurred, except in very rare cases of  dogs  with  oral  lesions  transmitting  infection  via  bites.  Likewise, person-to-person  transmission  is  rare,  with  a  single  case  of  a  man with genitourinary  disease  transmitting  pelvic  blastomycosis  to  his wife [7], and rare cases of intrauterine transmission from mother to child [8].
Unlike other endemic mycoses, such as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis  or  penicilliosis,  blastomycosis  has  only  occasionally  been reported as a significant pathogen in patients with AIDS. When it does occur in this setting,  it is typically  during  advanced stages  of  AIDS with very low CD4 lymphocyte counts. The disease tends to be rapidly progressive,  widely  disseminated  and  usually  fatal  [9].  If  response to  antifungal  agents  occurs,  the  patient  should  be  maintained  on chronic  secondary  prophylaxis  until  immune  reconstitution  occurs [10]. Blastomycosis has been reported in patients with other immunosuppressive conditions such as organ transplantation, hematologic malignancies, corticosteroid use and, more recently, tumor necrosis factor inhibitor use.

NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
The portal of infection is the lung, via inhalation of infective conidia, which are taken up by bronchopulmonary phagocytes. It is here that the fungus undergoes transformation into the yeast phase. Pulmonary infection may be asymptomatic, present like an acute bacterial pneumonia,  or  a  more  indolent  chronic  pneumonia  with  pulmonary nodules or cavitation. Presenting signs and symptoms are generally nonspecific,  but  referable  to  sites  of  hematogenous  seeding  in  the skin, bone, prostate, epididymis, or other organs. The inflammatory response is a mixture of granulomatous and pyogenic elements. Collections  of  neutrophils  range  in  size  from  microscopic  to  large abscesses (Fig. 82.1). Pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia and acanthosis  is  found  in  skin  and  mucous  membrane  lesions  that  has prompted misdiagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma or keratoacanthoma in some patients [2].

INTRODUCTION
Blastomycosis is caused by the dimorphic fungus Blastomyces dermatitidis , one of the endemic mycoses. Historically, this disease was termed 'North American blastomycosis' .  This  terminology  has  been  abandoned as there have been increasing reports of blastomycosis from other  parts  of  the  world  and  the  term  paracoccidioidomycosis  has become accepted for the disease previously called 'South American blastomycosis',  which  is  caused  by Paracoccidioides  brasiliensis [1]. Infection typically presents as an acute or indolent pulmonary process, or as a chronic skin lesion, although infection of almost any site can occur.  The  disease  may  often  be  misdiagnosed  as  another  type  of infection or malignancy. Treatment with antifungal agents is usually successful.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Most reported cases of blastomycosis have been from North America, concentrated in the Mississippi, Ohio, and St Lawrence River basins and the Great Lakes region of the USA and Canada [2]. Occasional cases have been reported from Africa, Central America, northern South America, and the Mediterranean basin. Unlike other endemic mycoses, such as histoplasmosis or coccidioidomycosis, B. dermatitidis has not been consistently isolated from the soil, although epidemiologically, this  is  the  source  [3].  There  have  been  common-source  outbreaks reported in the literature, and Klein and coworkers provided strong evidence  of B.  dermatitidis in  the  soil  by  culturing  the  organism  in

LUNG LESIONS
Acute  pulmonary  blastomycosis  can  present  as  an  asymptomatic radiographic  infiltrate  or  as  a  pneumonia  that  is  indistinguishable from  acute  bacterial  pneumonia  with  fever,  chills,  and  productive cough with or without hemoptysis. Another presentation is several months of fever, nightsweats, productive cough, and chest pain; this is  typical for patients with chronic pulmonary blastomycosis. Adult respiratory distress syndrome can manifest in patients with miliary or endobronchial spread of infection and is associated with a high mortality. Pulmonary findings are present radiologically in half of patients. The  radiologic  appearance  can  resemble  bacterial  pneumonia  in patients who present more acutely (Fig. 82.2) or as a mass lesion in patients with a more indolent course [1 1]. Chronic pulmonary lesions may show fibrosis and cavitation. Calcification, pleural  effusion  or hilar adenopathy are rarely encountered.

SKIN LESIONS
The skin is the most common extrapulmonary site of infection, with 40-80% of patients having skin involvement [12]. Lesions are often multiple  and  tend  to  be  located  on  the  face  and  extremities  (Fig. 82.3).  They  are  typically  erythematous,  well-circumscribed,  hyperkeratotic, crusted nodules or plaques that enlarge over weeks. These lesions may ulcerate to leave an undermined edge (Fig. 82.4). Some central healing can occur in chronic cases forming a hypopigmented, atrophic, fibrotic area. Lesions may also occur in the mucous membranes of the nose, lips, larynx, and vagina.

============================================================
BONE LESIONS
Osteomyelitis occurs in up to 25% of patients, affecting essentially any  bone  [2].  Osteolytic  lesions  and  an  adjacent  cold  abscess  are typical features. In the majority, concomitant skin or lung infection allows the diagnosis to be made. The treatment course is usually of longer duration for bone infection [10].

============================================================
SYSTEMIC INFECTIONS
Almost every organ has been reported to be infected with B. dermatitidis .  Systemic  signs  of  fever  and  weight  loss  are  mild  early  in  the course, but become progressively more severe with disease extension. After a period of time ranging from weeks to years, chronic infection may disseminate to multiple organs and cause death if unrecognized. Spontaneous  remission  is  rarely  observed  once  infection  has  progressed beyond the lung.

PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Microscopic examination of stained histopathology or cytology specimens and culture of secretions or tissues remains the cornerstone of diagnosis for blastomycosis. When clinical suspicion is high, direct microscopic examination of sputum, skin, aspirates of abscess fluid,
FIGURE 82.4 Small hyperkeratotic skin lesion of blastomycosis.
or  body  fluid  following  either  digestion  of  human  cells  with  10% potassium hydroxide or staining with calcafluor white or Papanicolaou's stain is the most rapid and effective means for diagnosis. The organism can be visualized in tissue specimens stained with methenamine silver or periodic acid-Schiff stains [12].
Culture should be done and is positive in almost all cases. At room temperature, the organism will grow as a mold in 2-4 weeks on a wide range of culture media, including Sabouraud agar. Skin tests are not helpful and are not available. Serologic studies using a variety of antigens  and  methods  have  likewise  been  unreliable  for  diagnosis [13]. An assay to detect B. dermatitidis antigens in urine is available commercially and may be helpful, although significant cross-reactivity has  been  noted  with  histoplasmosis,  paracoccidioidomycosis,  and penicilliosis [14].

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Skin lesions may be mistaken for basal or squamous cell carcinoma. Nasal lesions may resemble leishmaniasis and paracoccidioidomycosis.  Laryngeal  lesions  mimic  epidermoid  carcinoma  both  clinically and pathologically. Pulmonary blastomycosis may resemble tuberculosis and other granulomatous infections, or bronchogenic carcinoma both symptomatically and radiographically.

TREATMENT
The  vast  majority  of  patients  coming  to  medical  attention  will need  antifungal  chemotherapy  [2].  Oral  itraconazole  at  a  dose  of
200-400 mg daily is now the recommended drug for all but the most severe cases. Amphotericin B was the drug of choice for all patients in  the  past  and  continues  to  be  initial  therapy  for  those  with  lifethreatening blastomycosis or central nervous system (CNS) infection [10]. The deoxycholate formulation is given intravenously at a dose of 0.7-1mg/kg daily. Alternatively, the liposomal formulation, which is  preferred  for CNS  disease, can be  given at  3-5 mg/kg daily with fewer side effects, but at greater cost. Amphotericin formulations are typically  given  for  1-2  weeks  (4-6  weeks  for  CNS  disease),  until improvement occurs, after which therapy can be completed with oral itraconazole.  Non-life-threatening  infections  can  be  treated  for  the entire course with itraconazole alone. Itraconazole achieves cure rates of approximately 95% in those completing therapy [15]. It also has fewer  adverse  effects  than  amphotericin  B.  Fluconazole  has  lower success rates in treatment and requires much higher doses than itraconazole.  A  few  cases  have  been  treated  with  voriconazole  or posaconazole.
