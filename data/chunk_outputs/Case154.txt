EPIDEMIOLOGY
Epidemic  typhus  has  been  traditionally  associated  with  wars  and other  catastrophic  conditions that lead to poor  sanitary  conditions with lice infestation. It has been described as a disease of the highlands,  cold  areas,  poverty,  imprisonment  and  civil  unrest,  when people  are  forced  to  repetitively  wear  the  same  clothing,  often  in crowded and unhygienic conditions; however, epidemic typhus has a potentially  worldwide  repartition.  Incidence  of  epidemic  typhus  is highest  in  colder  months  (it  mainly  occurs  during  the  winter  and spring). Men and women are equally affected [3]. Brill-Zinsser disease (the  relapsing  form  of  the  disease)  can  occur  up  to  40  years  after primary  infection  under  stress  conditions  or  in  immunocompromised hosts. Sylvatic  forms associated with flying squirrels and the presence of R. prowazekii in ticks suggest that reservoirs and transmission  dynamics  of R.  prowazekii are  more  complex  than  previously described [4].
In 1997, a large outbreak of typhus was reported in Burundi during the civil war; 100,000 people were estimated to be infected and the case  fatality  rate  was  15%  [1].  Small  outbreaks  and  sporadic  cases have also been reported in different regions of the world since 1997, including  Russia,  Peru,  Northern  Africa,  the  USA,  and  France  (Fig. 61.1). This highlights the persistent threat of epidemic typhus. Eradication of epidemic typhus appears to be difficult because of possible recrudescence of R. prowazekii in infested people which is associated with Brill-Zinsser disease, and the unknown contribution of nonhuman reservoirs.

NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
In1909, Charles Nicolle observed the role of the body louse Pediculus humanus subsp. corporis (or P. humanus subsp. humanus ) in the transmission of epidemic typhus. Lice become infected when feeding on the  blood  of  a  bacteremic  patient.  Transmission  between  human hosts  is  associated  with  close  human  contacts;  primary  infection occurs when R. prowazekii is transmitted from the vector to the host, not by louse bites, but by contamination of bite sites, conjunctivae and  mucous  membranes  (including  the  respiratory  tract)  with  the infectious feces or crushed bodies of infected lice. These infested aerosols constitute a source of infection of typhus for clinicians in contact with lice-infested patients. In the case of Brill-Zinsser disease, recrudescent infection of the human host is associated with bacteremia; if louse infestation of the patient occurs at the same time, lice become infected through host feeding and, if appropriate conditions exist, an outbreak can occur [3].
It was previously thought that humans were the only reservoir of R. prowazekii and human body lice the only vectors. But since the 1950s, specific antibodies have been detected in, and the bacterium isolated from, several domestic and wild animals. Ticks might be a reservoir for R. prowazekii , as Amblyomma spp. and Hyalomma spp. were found to be infected in Mexico and Ethiopia, respectively [3]. Of particular

Key features
- The etiological agent of epidemic louse-borne typhus is Rickettsia prowazekii
- Epidemic typhus is transmitted by body lice and largely a)ects impoverished or displaced people
- Epidemic typhus manifests as an acute febrile illness with headache and myalgia. Neurologic manifestations, rash, vasculitis, and gangrene of extremities can occur. In untreated cases, mortality is high
- Diagnosis is usually based on clinical suspicion, especially in the right epidemiologic situation. Serology is available
- Treatment is simple, safe and inexpensive, and usually involves a single 200-mg dose or short course of doxycycline
- Relapses years after initial infection are termed Brill-Zinsser disease
- Synonyms: epidemic typhus, louse-borne typhus, exanthematic typhus, jail fever
- Control e)orts should focus on de-lousing both individuals and populations and providing hygienic conditions

INTRODUCTION
Epidemic typhus is  transmitted by human body lice from  infected patients (during acute infection or relapse) to naïve people. It is one of the major threats to public health during civil unrest, displacement, and war. Typhus has probably caused more deaths than wars in the history of humanity; it remains a permanent public health problem, as poor sanitary conditions can lead to epidemic outbreaks, such as in Burundi in 1997 [1].
Epidemic  typhus  may  have  been  the  cause  of  the  Athens  plague described by Thucydides, but it may also have been typhoid fever. The first account of typhus may have been recorded during the civil wars of  Grenada  1489-90.  In 1739,  Huxham made the  first  distinction between typhus and typhoid; in 1760 Boissier de Sauvage quoted the name 'typhus', which is Greek for 'smokey/cloudy', and refers to the mental status changes associated with typhus. 'Typhoid' was an illness that had many features of typhus, but was distinct. In 1909, Charles Nicolle showed the role of body lice in the transmission of epidemic  typhus;  in  1910,  Brill  described  the  recrudescent  form; finally, in 1916, Rocha Lima described the bacterium and named it Rickettsia prowazekii in honor of previous researchers who both died of typhus [2].

INTRODUCTION
interest is the reservoir formed by flying squirrels ( Glaucomys volans ). Reported cases of epidemic typhus in the USA have been associated with contact with flying squirrels [4]. The role of animal reservoirs in the global burden of typhus is currently not well-defined. After entering the body of an infected human, the bacteria spread through blood and lymph, then they infect endothelial cells of the small capillaries. Rickettsial infection leads to endothelial damage, which is associated with widespread vasculitis; the clinical signs and symptoms relate to the affected organs. Endothelial injury can also lead to micro- and macroscopic foci  of  hemorrhages.  Vasculitis  can  also  be  associated with thrombi in small vessels and surrounding inflammatory infiltrates.  These  correspond  to  typhus  nodules  and  may  occur  focally throughout the central nervous system (CNS); these lesions explain the neurologic features commonly associated with epidemic typhus [3]. The vasculitis of R. prowazekii infection is generalized and, thus, any organ may be involved.

CLINICAL FEATURES
Clinical features of epidemic typhus are nonspecific and consequently not easy to differentiate from other infectious processes. The incubation period is usually 10-14 days, but may be as short as 6 days. A prodromal malaise may pre-date the onset of fever by 1-3 days. Onset of typhus is usually abrupt and manifested by fever (which continues until death or recovery), severe headaches, severe myalgias, abdominal pain, arthralgias, malaise, anorexia, chills, photophobia, and nonproductive  cough.  Facial  flushing  and  conjunctival  suffusion  can occur, as can nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation. During a 1997 outbreak in Burundi [1], a crouching attitude named 'sutama' was reported, caused by myalgia and severe fatigue.
In untreated cases, as the illness progresses, neurologic manifestations become more common. In up to 80% of untreated cases, CNS manifestations, such as delirium that interrupts stupor, coma, seizures, and hearing loss,  can  occur.  Rash  is  often  present,  although  difficult  to discern  in  individuals  with  dark  skin.  The  rash  is  initially  nonconfluent, with erythematous and blanching areas; macules, petechiae, and purpura can occur. It begins on the trunk and the axilla and may spread centrifugally. It is not found on the face, palms, or soles, except in severely ill patients. In mild cases, it may fade in 1 or 2 days. Cough is reported in 38-70% of patients. Primary pulmonary involvement, as well as secondary bacterial pneumonia, can occur during epidemic typhus. In severe cases, symptoms secondary to vasculitis can provoke cerebral  thrombosis,  gangrene  (that  can  require  amputation),  and multiple organ dysfunction, shock, and death [3].
Prior to the development of antimicrobial treatment, mortality could reach 60%. With appropriate antibiotics, mortality of approximately 4% is  now  common.  Severity  is  associated  with  malnutrition  and advanced age.

CLINICAL FEATURES
Brill-Zinsser  disease usually occurs  with  advancing age and waning immunity. Cases are sporadic and unrelated to recent louse infestation. Compared with acute infection, Brill-Zinsser disease is shorter and  its  clinical  features  are  usually  mild,  although  fatal  cases  can occur. Rashes are reported to be less frequent.
Cases of typhus related to flying squirrels are sporadic. These cases may clinically present  as meningitis.  This form of typhus is poorly understood.

PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Clinical  diagnosis  of  sporadic  cases  is  difficult,  although  clinically diagnosing a compatible case during a known epidemic is less uncertain.  Taken  in  isolation,  differentiating  the  clinical  signs  of  typhus from those of other infections is not easy. This underscores the importance of obtaining a thorough history of animal and lice or arthropod contact  in  patients  with  acute  febrile  illness.  However,  a  cluster  of sudden onset of severe pyrexia among louse-infested people living in cold, crowded and unhygienic conditions should immediately alert the clinician to possible typhus. Any severe outbreak of unexplained fever in unhygienic environments should also evoke consideration of epidemic typhus.
The main differential diagnoses that should be considered when considering louse-borne typhus are typhoid (these diagnoses have been clinically confused for centuries), murine typhus, other riskettsioses, malaria, and hemorrhagic fevers. Finally, lice transmit three diseases which must be suspected in case of fever in louse-infested patients as they can occur simultaneously [1]: relapsing fever, trench fever, and epidemic  typhus.  The  fever  pattern  in  epidemic  typhus  is  daily  or continuous, while in the other two entities it is often more cyclical.
Laboratory findings during epidemic typhus include thrombocytopenia  (40%  of  cases),  increased  hepatic  transaminase  activity  (up  to 60%;  although  jaundice  is  rare),  hyperbilirubinemia  (20%)  and increased  blood  urea  nitrogen  concentrations  (31%).  Oliguria  and proteinuria  are  common.  In  the  early  phase,  leukopenia  can  be observed.

PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The reference method for diagnosis is serologic testing using an indirect immunofluorescence assay. Fresh blood, as well as blood dried on blotting paper, can be used. Both acute- and convalescent-phase serum  should  be  assayed.  However,  there  is  cross-reactivity  mainly with R.  typhi .  Western  blotting  with  cross-adsorption is required to differentiate between these typhus group Rickettsia and to diagnose epidemic  typhus rather  than  endemic  typhus.  It  is  also  difficult  to differentiate  between  primary  infection  and  Brill-Zinsser  disease solely based on serologic results. Usually in Brill-Zinsser disease, no specific IgM are recovered, but the diagnosis cannot solely be based on this feature [3].
Cell culture can be used to isolate R. prowazekii from samples, but this approach  is  not  clinically  practical  and  requires  Biosafety  Level-3 laboratories  with  an  experienced  staff.  Molecular  detection  of R. prowazekii has been developed and is becoming increasingly clinically useful. Real-time  PCR assays are especially useful,  because  they are rapid, sensitive and specific [5]. Molecular detection can be performed on several types of human samples (blood, skin biopsy, etc.) and also on lice (that can be sent dry or in alcohol). The latter approach can be particularly helpful in cases of possible typhus outbreaks because detection of rickettsial DNA in lice can indicate extant human typhus ( R. prowazekii is pathogenic for lice and provokes rapid death of lice, therefore if rickettsial DNA is detected  in lice,  it  corresponds to an active and extensive outbreak).

TREATMENT
The treatment of typhus is safe, easy and inexpensive. A single dose of  200 mg  of  orally  administered  doxycycline  will  usually  cure patients [6]. Early administration must be prescribed in any suspected case  without  waiting  for  laboratory  confirmation.  The  absence  of clinical response within 2-3 days of treatment strongly argues against louse-borne typhus. A 5-day therapy or a therapy lasting for 2-4 days after  defervescence  is  often  administered  to  preclude  relapses.  For Brill-Zinsser disease, doxycycline is also the recommended treatment. A single dose or short course of doxycycline in young children poses only a small risk of teeth staining, but that risk needs to be weighed against high mortality associated with advanced disease (Box 61.1). If  an  alter  native  is  required,  chloramphenicol is usually the recommended treatment. Doxycycline can be used intravenously or intramuscularly in case of clinical severity or if oral course is impossible. Ciprofloxacine  must  be  avoided; indeed a patient misdiagnosed as having typhoid, died from typhus after this treatment, in spite of its in vitro efficiency.
In association with antibiotic treatment, de-lousing is a critical control measure, but quarantine is not necessary. Eradication of lice can be performed with an insecticide (by washing clothing and bedding with soap containing 7% dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane [DDT]); clothing can also be washed in water hotter than 60°C and then ironed; if the previous measures are not possible, clothes must be removed and left unworn for a week, as lice die 5 days after being deprived of blood.  Effective  prevention  also  requires  the  application  of  basic hygiene and sanitary conditions. Nevertheless, it must be highlighted that de-lousing is not sufficient for eradication of epidemic typhus,

BOX 61.1  Pediatric Box
The standard regimen treatment for children is a single 100-mg doxycycline dose. Any suspected case should be treated immediately. A single dose or short course of doxycycline in young children poses only a small risk of teeth staining, and that risk needs to be weighed against the high mortality associated with advanced  disease. No  particular clinical  or  epidemiologic feature distinguishes epidemic typhus in children from that in adults.
because infected individuals retain R. prowazekii for the rest of their lives  and  can  therefore  initiate  new  outbreaks  if  a  bacteremia  concomitant to lice infestation occurs.
When dealing with control at a population level, a preferred method is  the  blowing  of  insecticidal  powder  between  humans  and  their underclothes, following World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations. For example, talcum powder can be used with permethrin  (0.5%),  DDT  (10%),  or  lindane  (1%).  Application  can  be performed with any kind of dusting apparatus or by hand; 30-50 g of dust per person is usually needed and is blown through neck openings, up the sleeves, from all sides of the loosened waist and also into socks, headwear, and bedding. Usually one treatment is sufficient, but re-treatment may be required if infestation persists [7]. Doxycycline must be prescribed in any suspected case.
Vaccines against epidemic typhus have existed since 1920. The attenuated strain R. prowazekii Madrid E has been used as a vaccine; however, the limited market for vaccine and the efficacy of antibiotic treatment and other control strategies have limited  vaccine  development and usage.  There is currently no commercially available vaccine for epidemic typhus.
