INTRODUCTION
Given the prevalence of hepatotropic infections and the exposure of  the  liver  to  gastrointestinal  organisms  and  toxins,  it  is  not surprising that many tropical diseases manifest primarily in the liver. Acute and chronic diseases of the hepatobiliary system pose major threats to the health of people living within, and travelers to,  endemic  regions. The World Health  Organization  (WHO) has estimated that the age-standardized mortality rate related to cirrhosis is > 20/100,000 in Africa, Asia, and South America. 1 This chapter provides a framework to approach common presentations of liver diseases in the tropics. Each primary clinical presentation is discussed with emphasis on differential diagnosis; for individual conditions, the reader is referred to the speci{c chapter.

APPROACH TO LIVER DISEASE
The  liver  has  a  great  capacity  to  regenerate;  however,  hepatic dysfunction  and  failure,  which  usually  occur  in  the  context  of cirrhosis, carry a poor prognosis. Speci{c etiologic agents cause a variety of liver injuries. The functional unit of the liver is the hepatic  lobule.  Blood  enters  from  either  the  portal  (70%)  or systemic (30%) circulation, |owing across the liver sinusoids to the central vein, and then back to the heart via the hepatic veins. The hepatocyte microvilli, which project basally  into  the  perisinusoidal space and apically into the bile canaliculi, actively secrete

The liver is integrally involved in the  synthesis  of  proteins;  metabolism  of  amino  acids,  fat,  and carbohydrate; and the detoxi{cation of many compounds, receiving blood from the intestine, spleen, and pancreas via the portal circulation. As a result, the liver is exposed to numerous potential infective and toxic pathogens from the gastrointestinal tract, particularly in  the  tropics  and  developing  world.  Hepatic  infections  most commonly spread to the liver hematogenously, but can also ascend via the biliary tract. Gastrointestinal organisms enter the liver via the portal circulation or biliary tract and include pathogenic ameba, enteric bacteria,  hydatids,  liver  |ukes  ( Fasciola,  Opisthorchis ,  and Clonorchis ),  and  schistosomes.  Systemic infections seed the liver via  the  hepatic  artery  and  include Mycobacterium  tuberculosis, Burkholderia pseudomallei (the cause of melioidosis), syphilis, and fungal infections.
Characterization of the interaction between the gastrointestinal microbiome and the liver has led to a greater understanding of some liver diseases. 2 The microbiota are the organisms that make up the microenvironment of the gastrointestinal tract; the genetic composition is termed the microbiome. Studies are providing strong evidence that microbial factors in|uence the pathophysiology of speci{c liver diseases, particularly non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), alcoholic liver disease, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), HIV-related liver disease, and the complications of cirrhosis such as infection and encephalopathy.

Hepatobiliary Diseases
The spectrum of liver disease varies from asymptomatic liver lesions and abnormalities detected on routine blood tests to hepatic failure. Chronic in|ammation and subsequent hepatic {brosis can lead to cirrhosis, characterized by the formation of {brous tissue and regenerative nodules in the liver that disrupt hepatocyte and biliary function and obstruct |ow through canaliculi and sinusoids. These histologic changes result in the clinical manifestations of liver  disease. Acute and chronic liver failure are de{ned by the inability of the liver to maintain normal metabolic and synthetic function  with  manifestations  that  include  hyperbilirubinemia (leading to jaundice), coagulopathy (leading to bleeding), increased nitrogenous waste products (associated with encephalopathy), and hypoalbuminemia (contributing to edema and ascites). 3 Vascular obstructions that affect sinusoidal blood |ow can lead to portal hypertension, which itself then contributes to ascites and formation of varices, both of which are major complications of cirrhosis. 4
The evaluation of the liver should determine the site of hepatic injury, the underlying etiology, and the severity of the liver disease. Conceptually, liver disease can be divided into pre-hepatic, involving the portal vein or hepatic artery; hepatic, involving the parenchymal lobule, including hepatocytes and biliary and vascular sinusoids; and  post-hepatic, involving  the hepatic  vein  or biliary  systems. Characterizing liver abnormalities may involve a combination of clinical,  biochemical,  serologic,  microbiologic,  radiologic,  and histologic investigations. These evaluations should be re{ned by knowledge of the geographic distribution of each condition and an understanding of risk factors for each disease. Evaluation should include  a  detailed  history  encompassing  a  review  of  symptoms (including  right  upper  quadrant  pain  or  discomfort,  anorexia, jaundice, darkened urine, pruritus, fever), underlying conditions, past vaccination history, and epidemiologic exposures (including exposures to  water,  food,  blood,  animals,  and  sexual  practices). Examination  should  include  assessment  of  signs  and  {ndings consistent  with  liver  disease,  including  jaundice,  occurrence of  smooth-surfaced  white  spots  or  patches  under  the  nails

(leukonychia), palmar erythema, spider nevi, and gynecomastia. Hepatomegaly can be associated with most causes of hepatitis and liver lesions, whereas splenomegaly in the context of liver disease represents either portal hypertension or an underlying cause, such as malaria.
The inaccurately termed liver function tests (LFTs) can be used to re{ne the site of liver disease (Fig. 4.1). Bilirubin is a breakdown product of hemoglobin, which is conjugated by the liver. Elevation can result from an increased load (pre-hepatic), reduced hepatic conjugation  or  transport,  or  post-hepatic  biliary  obstruction. Elevation of hepatic cytosolic alanine aminotransferase (AL T) and mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase (AST) indicates parenchymal in|ammation and hepatocyte injury. In contrast, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lining the hepatic canalicular membrane, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), expressed on the epithelium of the bile ducts, are cholestatic enzymes that increase  in biliary disease. However, ALP also increases in some parenchymal and granulomatous disease, and GGT can also be elevated after injury mediated by alcohol and drugs, such as phenytoin. By using these biochemical markers, however, patterns of liver injury can

be characterized as hepatocellular (AL T/AST), cholestatic (ALP/ GGT), or mixed. The true functional tests of  hepatic function include assessing blood levels of albumin, bilirubin, and coagulation factors. Thrombocytopenia in chronic liver disease is often secondary  to  portal  hypertension.  In  the  tropics,  peripheral  blood eosinophilia can be useful in suggesting certain parasitic infections. Based on clinical and blood parameters, two scoring systems exist that relate the severity of chronic liver disease and prognosis: the Childs-Pugh  classi{cation  and  the  Model  for  End-stage  Liver Disease (MELD) score 5 (T able 4.1).
The primary approach to the differential diagnosis depends on the results of the initial examination and laboratory testing as outlined in Fig. 4.1. Further investigations may include a hepatitis screen  and  imaging.  A  hepatitis  screen  usually  includes  viral serologies (hepatitis A, B, and C), immune serologies (including anti-nuclear antibody [ANA], anti-mitochondrial antibody [AMA], and anti-smooth muscle antibody), and metabolic markers such as  iron  or  copper  studies. Applicability  of  tests  will  depend on local resources and prevalence of speci{c conditions. An ultrasound is  a  useful,  usually  accessible  investigation  that  can  identify

When jaundiced, the total bilirubin should be fractionated into unconjugated (also termed indirect ) and conjugated (also termed direct ). Imaging is an important diagnostic tool to look for both biliary dilation and mass lesions (see Table 4.4) and to assess hepatic vasculature, with ultrasound more available in resource-limited settings than computed tomography.

Acute Hepatitis
Acute hepatitis can be de{ned as any syndrome that causes elevation of LFTs for less than 6 months. This can be caused by a variety of infections, toxin/drug exposures, or metabolic diseases, often with a typical hepatocellular, cholestatic, or mixed picture on LFT s. A variety of viruses, bacteria, and other organisms can cause an acute elevation in liver enzymes, either due to direct infection (as in  the  viral  hepatitides)  or  indirectly  as  a  response  to  systemic infection (e.g., during sepsis, malaria, typhoid fever). These and other common toxins and drugs that commonly cause hepatitis are summarized in T able 4.2. Because distinguishing causality by clinical presentation alone is dif{cult, knowledge of the geographic distribution  of  infections  and  a  history  eliciting  particular  risk factors is critical in determining the likelihood of each entity and guiding evaluation and treatment.
Hepatitis A virus (HAV), a non-enveloped RNA virus in the Picornavirus family, is the most common cause of viral hepatitis worldwide. HAV infection is transmitted by the fecal-oral route, and in the developing world often occurs in the {rst years of life.  HAV infection is  usually asymptomatic when acquired in childhood and confers lifelong immunity. In adults, acute HAV

is more likely to cause symptomatic illness, including prolonged jaundice  with  cholestasis  and,  rarely,  fulminant  hepatitis  and liver failure, especially with older age. T ender hepatomegaly and splenomegaly may be present on physical examination. Overall, recovery and lack of sequelae are the outcomes in the vast majority of cases, especially among young children. Due to the unlikelihood of exposure that would generate natural immunity in many people in the developed world, HAV remains a signi{cant risk to travelers from low-prevalence countries. Proper use of pooled immunoglobulin  (Ig)  and  inactivated  hepatitis  A  vaccine  can  reduce the  risk  of  acute  infection  signi{cantly,  and  may  be  used  for post-exposure prophylaxis 8 ; restricting food preparation among infected individuals is also important to prevent further household transmission.
Hepatitis  E  virus  (HEV),  a  calicivirus,  is  another  virus  that also  has  a  fecal-oral  route  of  transmission.  HEV  has  a  more localized  distribution  than  HAV  (Mexico, Asia, Africa,  and  the Middle East) and should be considered in people living in areas with outbreaks or  in  travelers  returning from those  countries. 9 Most  cases  are  self-limited,  but  fulminant  hepatitis  can  occur, with overall mortality rates of about 0.5% to 4%. Pregnancy is a risk factor for severe HEV infection, with mortality as high as 20% if  acquired during the  third  trimester.  Diagnoses  of  both HAV and HEV rely on detection of speci{c IgM antibodies from sera (see Chapter 35).

CHUNK 13
============================================================
Acute Hepatitis
In contrast, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are transmitted primarily through parenteral, sexual, or perinatal exposure. In high-prevalence areas, HBV is primarily transmitted by vertical exposure from mother to child, and acute congenital infection is  often asymptomatic with higher rates  of chronicity (90%) than infections acquired later in life. 10 This course contrasts with  the  clinical  outcome  of  HBV  acquired  during  adulthood, generally  through  parenteral  or  sexual  exposures.  In  this  latter setting,  symptomatic  hepatitis  is  more  prevalent  along  with spontaneous clearance of the virus (anti-HBs positive with clearance of HBsAg). Thus travelers or expatriates are at greater risk for acute  HBV  via  occupational  exposures  (contact  with  blood), nosocomial  exposures  (contact  with  contaminated  needles  or medical equipment), or unprotected sexual contacts. Recombinant vaccines, immunoglobulin for neonates, universal precautions, and safer  sex  are  key  to  preventing  HBV  infection.  Superinfection with hepatitis D virus (HDV) requires co-existing HBV infection and is generally transmitted by parenteral exposure. Diagnosis of acute HBV can be made by detection of surface antigen (HBsAg) and, more speci{cally for the acute  stage, by detection of IgM against the core protein (anti-HBc-IgM).
HCV is most ef{ciently transmitted via the parenteral route and in the majority ( ≈ 75%) of infected people causes a lifelong chronic infection. 11 HCV is endemic throughout the world, but some countries and regions have a higher prevalence (e.g., Egypt has a prevalence of > 10%), because the epidemic has been ampli{ed due to previous unsafe injection practices. Most acute infections are asymptomatic and thus do not come to medical attention, but acute symptomatic hepatitis with or without jaundice may occur. Fulminant  hepatitis  and  mortality  due  to  acute  HCV  are  very rare; however, chronic liver disease that develops over decades is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. There is no approved prophylactic  HCV  vaccine.  Diagnosis  of  acute  HCV  may  be dif{cult, but ideally is made by documentation of seroconversion and/or the presence of HCV RNA via molecular testing techniques in the presence of negative antibody.

Other  tropical  viral  infections  that  affect  the  liver  include vector-borne causes such as yellow fever, where hepatic necrosis may accompany up to 20% of cases (see Chapter 37.1) and dengue fever  (see  Chapter  36.1).  A  variety  of  viral  hemorrhagic  fevers may also involve the liver; some of these viruses (e.g., Lassa fever, Ebola virus; see Chapters 37.2 and 37.4) may require strict isolation precautions if suspected.

Elevation of transaminases can occur during various systemic infections,  including  sepsis.  Speci{c  bacterial  causes  of  acute hepatitis  include  spirochetal  illness  such  as  leptospirosis  and relapsing fever, or syndromes caused by gram-negative bacteria such as melioidosis, typhoid fever, and tularemia, as well as scrub typhus  and  Q  fever. Accompanying  pulmonary  symptoms  may result from bacterial pneumonia, sepsis, Q fever, or tuberculosis. Rarely, miliary tuberculosis may be associated with acute elevation in transaminases, but is more commonly associated with granulomatous  hepatitis.  Granulomatous  hepatitis  can  be  caused  by several  infectious  and  non-infectious  etiologies,  but  primary diagnostic considerations should include tuberculosis (see Chapter 43), brucellosis (see Chapter 75), and Q fever (see Chapter 71). Eosinophilia may be caused by a variety of parasitic infections, but eosinophilia in the setting of symptomatic hepatitis or hepatomegaly may suggest schistosomiasis, trichinellosis, capillariasis, or fascioliasis (see Chapters 126, 119, 111, and 128).
Non-infectious causes of liver enzyme abnormalities include acute hepatic injury from medications (T able 4.3) such as isoniazid or pyrazinamide;  commonly used antimycobacterial drugs; acetaminophen;  or  toxins  such  as  alcohol,  mushrooms,  carbon tetrachloride, or a|atoxins.

============================================================
Chronic Liver Disease
Chronic hepatitis is arbitrarily de{ned as abnormal LFT s for more than  6  months. The major consequence  of chronic hepatitis  is cirrhosis with its concomitant risk of liver failure and cancer. The most common cause of chronic hepatitis worldwide is HBV , with an  estimated  400  million  people  currently  chronically  infected worldwide. Untreated, about 20% to 25% of people with chronic HBV may die of complications of cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and this course may be accelerated by co-existing HDV infection. Chronic HCV is also a cause of signi{cant morbidity and mortality worldwide, with an estimated 71 million people chronically  infected. 12 Although  effective  treatments  have  been developed  for  each  of  these  viruses,  particularly  direct-acting anti-viral treatment for HCV , their cost is often prohibitive. 13
Schistosomiasis (see Chapter 126) is another major cause of chronic liver disease. 14 Adult schistosome worms live in draining veins  of  the  intestine  or  urinary  tract.  Eggs  secreted  by  adult worms  in  mesenteric  vessels  can  be  |ushed  into  the  liver  and become trapped in pre-sinusoidal portal venules, leading to intense in|ammation, granulomas, and a 'pipe-stem' {brosis. This can
result in portal hypertension out of proportion to the level of {brosis and  hepatic  dysfunction.  Given  the  prevalence  and  geographic overlap with chronic viral hepatitis, alternative causes of liver disease should be considered when true cirrhosis is found in the setting of chronic schistosomiasis. Moreover, given that each may be clinically silent for years to decades, a high index of suspicion is needed to diagnose these conditions. Early treatment with praziquantel can lead to regression of {brosis due to schistosomiasis.

============================================================
CHUNK 17
============================================================
Chronic Liver Disease
Other causes of chronic liver disease leading to hepatic failure include granulomatous diseases, metabolic diseases, and alcoholic liver disease. Systemic infections can be associated with granulomas in the liver. In addition to schistosomiasis, these include mycobacteriosis, leishmaniasis, histoplasmosis, brucellosis, and syphilis. Non-infectious  causes  include  sarcoidosis,  lymphoma,  primary biliary cirrhosis, and drug reactions. High environmental copper ingestion in children can also lead to cirrhosis (copper-associated childhood cirrhosis or Indian childhood cirrhosis); recognition of how to prevent and treat this entity has decreased the incidence of this disease. African Bantu hemosiderosis is a disease of iron overload  similar  in  manifestations  to  hemochromatosis;  the presumed genetic basis of this disease is currently unknown. It is important  to  counsel  those  with  chronic  liver  disease  to  avoid additional hepatic insults via prevention of exposures to infectious agents and toxins, as well as provision of vaccination against hepatitis A and hepatitis B viruses.
An increasing problem in the developing world is NAFLD. It has been estimated that the rate of obesity has doubled since 1980 with 2 billion people overweight and 600 million obese. 15 A recent systematic review of global NAFLD found that the overall prevalence is approximately 25%, with the highest prevalence 30.5% in South America and the lowest 13.5% in Africa. 16 Although a major contribution is excess calorie intake, other factors such as genetic variants linked to obesity and NAFLD such as PNPLA3 variants are likely contributing. 17 The overall incidence of liverrelated mortality in NAFLD has been estimated at 2%-the large and increasing denominator means that this will become a signi{cant problem into the future.

============================================================
Jaundice and Biliary Obstruction
Many tropical diseases may result in cholestasis and jaundice, through varied mechanisms. Overload of unconjugated bilirubin can occur during  acute  hemolysis  due  to  malaria,  babesiosis,  Oroya  fever (caused  by Bartonella  bacilliformis ),  hemolytic  uremic  syndrome caused by Escherichia coli O157:H7 or Shigella dysenteriae, and sepsis related to Clostridium perfringens. Hemolytic crises can also complicate hemoglobinopathies and may be precipitated by infections. Jaundice may also be caused by processes that result in impaired conjugation and/or excretion of bilirubin by the liver. Some tropical diseases may be associated with both hemolysis and impaired excretion (i.e., leptospirosis). Non-obstructive causes include any causes of generalized  liver  dysfunction  (i.e.,  during  fulminant  acute  hepatitis  or subsequent to chronic liver disease/cirrhosis). Obstructive causes include non-infectious causes (gallstones and tumors), helminthic infection (such as those caused by Ascaris lumbricoides or Clonorchis sinensis and  other  liver  |ukes),  and  certain  protozoa  (such  as Cryptosporidium hominis/parvum, particularly in those with HIV or other states of immunosuppression). Any biliary obstruction can be  complicated  by  bacterial  cholangitis.  Some  of  these  entities often cause obstruction by mass lesions (see the later section) that may also involve blockage of the pancreatic duct; serum pancreatic enzymes and ultrasound and/or other imaging may be useful tests to help identify speci{c etiologies.

VASCULAR LIVER DISEASE (SEE TABLE 4.2)
Vascular diseases of the liver are uncommon and include BuddChiari syndrome, which is obstruction of the intra-hepatic portion of the inferior vena cava or hepatic veins; portal vein thrombosis; sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (previously termed veno-occlusive disease );  nodular  regenerative  hyperplasia;  and  peliosis. 18 Other causes include ischemic hepatitis and congestive hepatopathy as a result of cardiac failure, for example, right heart failure related to mycobacterial constrictive pericarditis. Usually, these vascular lesions are associated with portal hypertension, which precedes hepatic synthetic failure. Doppler ultrasound or contrast CT are useful imaging techniques for delineating the vessels of the liver.

============================================================
FOCAL LIVER LESIONS
The evaluation of a focal liver lesion includes non-invasive tests, such as serology, blood parameters, tumor markers, and microbiologic assessment, as well as further imaging with ultrasound, CT, or MRI, which should be contrast enhanced. 19 Determining the  size  and  whether  the  lesion  is  solid  or  cystic  is  useful  in stratifying  the  diagnostic  approach (T able 4.4). As a  rule, small lesions ( < 1 cm) are often benign, whereas larger lesions and those occurring in the context  of chronic  liver disease  have  a  higher potential for malignancy. Biopsy may be required to differentiate lesions; however, in a large study of focal liver lesions, pre-operative assessment was correct in 221 of the 225 cases (98.2%), suggesting that  {ne needle aspiration for diagnosis is not necessary in the majority of cases. 20 In surgical candidates this may lead to tumor seeding if the lesion is malignant.
In an individual presenting with a cystic liver lesion associated with right upper quadrant pain and fever, consideration should be  given  to  differentiating  amebic  from  pyogenic  abscesses. Although both are associated with signi{cant mortality, treatment differs. The typical imaging appearance of a pyogenic abscess is a |uid-{lled lesion with surrounding parenchymal edema. However, imaging could not satisfactorily differentiate pyogenic from amebic abscesses in a large series. 21 In  this series, multi-variate analysis identi{ed pyogenic abscesses to be associated with older age ( > 50 years), pulmonary {ndings on examination, multiple lesions, and negative amebic serology ( < 1  :  256 IU). The major route of seeding in  both  is  the  portal  circulation.  Pyogenic  liver  abscesses  are commonly polymicrobial, usually caused by mixed enteric facultative and anaerobic species. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus milleri are common pathogens. 22 Focal liver abscesses can also complicate melioidosis  (caused  by  the  gram-negative  bacillus Burkholderia pseudomallei ).  Melioidosis  occurs  in  Southeast  Asia,  China,  and northern Australia populations, particularly in patients with diabetes, alcoholism, or renal failure. 23

Pyogenic abscesses require early percutaneous drainage  and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Studies do not support a difference between intermittent versus continuous drainage of these abscesses. 24 In contrast, amebic abscesses are usually treated medically. Liver abscess  is  the  most  common  extra-intestinal  manifestation  of Entamoeba  histolytica infection  (see  Chapter  94),  occurring  in endemic areas such as Central and South America, West and South Africa, and India. 25 Amebic abscesses may be solitary or multiple, and  often  occur  in  the  right  hepatic  lobe  (75%).  Diagnosis  is usually based on detection of antibody in blood or antigen in stool or hepatic aspirates, as well as response to empiric treatment with metronidazole  or  its  analogs,  followed  by  a  luminal  amebicide such as paromomycin, iodoquinol, or diloxanide furoate to eliminate infection. 25 Drainage,  however,  should  be  considered  if  there is impending rupture or involvement of the pleura or pericardium.

Other cystic lesions of the liver include simple hepatic cysts and cystic hydatid disease caused by Echinococcus  granulosus (see Chapter 132). 26,27 Hydatid cysts have a typical radiologic appearance, which has led to a staging classi{cation based on imaging appearance. Generally, hydatid cysts have thick pericystic walls that may be calci{ed. The cysts usually have septa and may contain 'daughter' cysts. 28 Unlike abscesses, surrounding liver tissue is normal. AntiE. granulosus antibodies are positive in a majority of cases. 27 Current treatment usually involves albendazole with or without mechanical drainage or removal.
Primary  malignant  hepatobiliary  tumors  in  the  developing world often relate to underlying infectious etiologies. HCC is the second most common cause of cancer-related death, with an annual global incidence of 850,000, usually occurring in the context of chronic liver disease. 29,30 An estimated 85% of cases are associated with  chronic  viral  hepatitis  (HBV  and  HCV),  which  currently infects over 500 million people worldwide. 31 Levels of HBV viremia correlate with the risk of developing HCC, 32 and successful antiHBV vaccination programs lead to a signi{cant reduction in the incidence  of  HCC. 33 Eradication  of  HCV  is  associated  with  a reduced incidence of HCC. 34 Other risk factors for HCC include alcohol  and  a|atoxins,  which  may  in  part  explain  the  higher incidence of HCC in West African and Chinese populations without underlying HBV-related cirrhosis. 31 Diagnosis usually involves a combination of consistent {ndings on imaging studies and elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels in the setting of chronic liver disease. Typically, HCCs appear as hyper-vascular lesions on imaging, a result of neovascularization from the hepatic artery. Approximately 70% of cases are associated with an elevated AFP . In the largest randomized study of ultrasound and AFP screening in over 18,000 Chinese patients, bi-annual screening reduced HCC mortality by 37%. 35 However,  the  bene{t  of  screening  in  resource-limited settings  is  controversial. The  role  of AFP  is  also  controversial, and in some national recommendations it has been removed as a recommended screening test. 36

FOCAL LIVER LESIONS
To date, HCC treatment involves either locoregional therapies, including alcohol injection, radiofrequency ablation, or trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE), or surgical resection in those with small tumors and suf{cient hepatic reserve without portal hypertension. However, overall prognosis of HCC is usually poor. Newer targeted chemotherapies include sorafenib and regorafenib, but their current cost precludes use in resource-limited settings. 37,38 New  immune  therapies,  such  as  the  PD1  blockade,  also  look promising, but cost will limit future access. Benign parenchymal liver  tumors  include  adenomas,  {bronodular  hyperplasia,  and hemangiomas.  Chronic  biliary  in|ammation  associated  with persistent Salmonella infection of the biliary tract and Clonorchis / Opisthorchis liver  |ukes  has  also  been  associated  with gallbladder cancer and cholangiocarcinoma, respectively. 39 Individuals with these entities may usually eventually present with biliary obstruction,  with  elevation  of ALP  and  GGT,  with or  without jaundice, and biliary dilation on ultrasound, CT , or MRCP . ERCP
or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) with cytology can be diagnostic in  biliary  tract malignancies. Finally, in the context  of systemic disease, metastatic malignancy and lymphoma should be considered.

HIV AND THE LIVER
The majority of people infected with HIV live in resource-limited settings  (see  Chapter  31).  HIV  is  associated  with  a  number  of speci{c diseases of the liver related to immunosuppression, immune reconstitution,  and  drug  effects.  Broadly,  the  spectrum  of  liver disease  relates  to  CD4  count  and  antiretroviral  therapy  (ART) exposure. In areas where ART is available, the burden of disease has shifted from opportunistic infection and malignancy to chronic diseases, with liver disease related to viral hepatitis becoming a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. 40 Chronic viral hepatitis and HIV co-infection are associated with reduced spontaneous clearance and accelerated progression of viral hepatitis to cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and HCC. 41 A recent global meta-analysis regarding HIV-HCV co-infection estimated a worldwide global burden of 2.3 million cases, highest in people who inject drugs. 42 The  introduction  of  the  new  combination  HCV  direct-acting anti-viral therapies will have a signi{cant impact on the mortality and morbidity of HIV/HCV co-infection 43 (see Fig. 4.1). However, in those who do not have access to ART, opportunistic infection and  malignancy  are  still  prevalent.  Most  conditions  associated with liver disease are systemic and have spread hematogenously from other sites to involve the liver. These can be strati{ed by CD4 count, as most serious opportunistic infections occur with severe immunode{ciency (CD4 < 100 cells/ μ L). However, tuberculosis, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and Kaposi's sarcoma (KS)  can  occur  at  moderate  levels  (CD4 > 200  cells/ μ L)  of immunode{ciency. 44 Of the opportunistic infections infecting the liver, Mycobacterium avium complex is the most common. Other infections  include Cryptococcus  neoformans,  Pneumocystis  jirovecii, cytomegalovirus, and tuberculosis (T able 4.5). In particular geographic areas, visceral or disseminated leishmaniasis is also prevalent. AIDS  cholangiopathy  is  associated  with  cryptosporidial

and microsporidial infection in patients with CD4 counts < 100 cells/ μ L, and can lead to biliary obstruction. 45 Although the presentation is  variable, it is  usually  a  variation of  cholangitis  with  diarrhea, which is the result of the intestinal infection with these pathogens.
