Key features
- Penicilliosis marne+ei is a systemic fungal infection that causes morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected patients resident in or having visited Southeast Asia, northeastern India, southern China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan
- Papular skin lesions provide a clue for diagnosis. Other clinical manifestations are less speci,c: fever, weight loss, nonproductive cough, hepatosplenomegaly, and generalized lymphadenopathy

INTRODUCTION
Penicillium are  a  genus  of  fungi  that  are  widely  distributed  in  the environment, but rarely cause infection in humans [1]. P. marneffei is the most common Penicillium species to cause human infection and can occur both in normal hosts but more frequently in immunocompromised hosts. At the peak of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in northern Thailand, penicilliosis marneffei was the fourth most common AIDSrelated  opportunistic  infection,  after  tuberculosis,  extrapulmonary cryptococcosis,  and Pneumocystis pneumonia  [2].  Cases  of  disseminated infection have also been reported in HIV-infected patients from other countries following visits to the endemic area [3].
P. marneffei was first isolated from the visceral organs of a bamboo rat ( Rhizomys sinensis ) in Vietnam in 1956 [4]. The first natural human infection  was  reported  in  an  American  missionary  with  Hodgkin disease who had been living in Southeast Asia for several years [5]. The first case of penicilliosis marneffei in an HIV-infected native of Southeast Asia was reported in 1989 from Bangkok, coinciding with the beginning of the AIDS epidemic in the region [6]. The number of cases has markedly increased since.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
P. marneffei is endemic in Southeast Asia and southern China [7, 8]. Although  the  majority  of  cases  have  been  reported  from  northern Thailand, the prevalence of this infection has also increased in other countries in the region after the HIV/AIDS epidemic; these include Vietnam,  Hong  Kong,  Taiwan,  Malaysia,  Cambodia,  and  the  provinces  of  Guangxi  and  Guangdong  in  China.  Recently,  indigenous cases  of  penicilliosis  marneffei  have  been  described  from  Manipur State, India [9]. Figure 85.1 illustrates the current endemic areas for this fungal infection. Residents or travelers who visit these areas, in particular those with HIV infection, have a risk of acquiring this systemic fungal infection.

NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
P. marneffei is the only species of the genus that is a dimorphic fungus. In  the  environment,  it  grows  in  mycelial  form,  and  in  humans  or animals, it grows as a yeast-like form. Many aspects of the ecology of P. marneffei and the relationship to human infection remain unknown. Several studies have found that P. marneffei can infect four species of bamboo rats, i.e. R. sinensis , R. pruinosus , R. sumatrensis , and Cannomys badius [10]. However, attempts to link bamboo rats and human infection have been unsuccessful. The mode of transmission of P. marneffei is unknown; however, similar to other endemic fungal pathogens, it is likely that inhalation is the major route. A case report from France of a laboratory-acquired infection also suggests an airborne route of infection [1 1].

CLINICAL FEATURES
P. marneffei infection usually occurs late in the course of HIV infection. The majority of cases are observed in patients who have CD4 + cell counts of < 100 cells/mm 3 [12]. Clinical manifestations of penicilliosis  marneffei  are  nonspecific,  including  fever,  weight  loss, nonproductive  cough,  hepatosplenomegaly,  and  generalized  lymphadenopathy [7]. Skin lesions are seen in more than 70% of patients and, when present, are the best clues to the diagnosis. They are usually found as papules on the face, chest, and extremities. The center of the papule subsequently becomes necrotic, giving the appearance of an umbilicated papule (Fig. 85.2). Atypical presentations are osteoarthritis,  lung  mass  or  cavitary  lesions,  mesenteric  lymphadenitis,  and mucosal lesions in the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, stomach, colon,  and  genitalia.  Laboratory  values  are  nonspecific  and  can include slight elevation of liver enzymes and bilirubin, anemia, and leukocytosis or leukopenia. Roentgenograms of the chest may show diffuse  reticulonodular,  localized  alveolar,  or  diffuse  alveolar  infiltrates. Clinical features in children are the same as those seen in adults.

PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Clinical  diagnosis  of  penicilliosis  marneffei,  especially  in  patients with advanced HIV infection, is often difficult. Differential diagnoses include disseminated fungal infection, mycobacterial infection, and other HIV-related opportunistic infections. Physician awareness and a high degree of suspicion can lead to a timely diagnosis and management.  History  of  travel  to  or  residence  in  the  endemic  region  is

essential information. The definitive diagnosis is based on isolation of  organisms  from  culture  of  clinical  specimens  (Fig.  85.3)  or  by histopathologic demonstration of characteristic organisms in biopsy materials. However, these may require several days or weeks to get the results. Rapid diagnosis can be made by a bedside technique: microscopic examination of Wright-stained samples of skin scrapings, bone marrow aspirate, or lymph node biopsy touch smear. Many intracellular and extracellular basophilic, spherical, oval and elliptical yeastlike organisms are usually found. Some cells have a central septum which is a characteristic  feature  of P.  marneffei (Fig.  85.4)  [7].  This technique can also be used with tissue obtained by fine needle aspiration of the lymph node. It is particularly helpful in cases where there is no skin lesion or peripheral lymphadenopathy [13]. On some occasions, the fungus can be identified by microscopic examination of a Wright-stained peripheral blood smear [14]. P. marneffei bears a morphologic  resemblance  to Histoplasma  capsulatum but  tends  to  form more elongated yeast cells and divides by central septate fission rather than budding.
Recently, special techniques to identify organisms in tissue samples and serologic testing have been described [15, 16]. However, these tests are not widely used because commercial reagents are not available.

TREATMENT
P. marneffei is highly susceptible to itraconazole, ketoconazole, miconazole, and 5-flucytosine. Amphotericin B has intermediate antifungal activity, and fluconazole is the least active [17]. The mortality rate with delayed or no treatment is high [7,17]. In patients with severe disease, treatment with amphotericin B 0.6 mg/kg/day intravenously for 2 weeks followed by itraconazole 400 mg/day orally for 10 weeks is  recommended  [18].  Oral  itraconazole  400 mg/day  for  8  to  12 weeks can be used in patients with less severe disease [9, 19]. Voriconazole is an effective alternative; it can be given by intravenous followed  by  oral  administration  or  orally  from  the  beginning  [20]. Treatment in children is similar to that in adults. Relapse of penicilliosis  marneffei  is  common  after  discontinuation  of  antifungal therapy [19, 21]. Suppressive therapy with itraconazole 200 mg once daily after successful antifungal therapy is required lifelong or for as long as immunocompromise persists [21].
Primary prevention of P. marneffei with an antifungal agent in HIVinfected  patients  is  not  usually  recommended.  However,  in  areas
where systemic fungal infections are common, primary prophylaxis of AIDS-associated opportunistic infections can be considered [12].
In  advanced  HIV  disease  and P.  marneffei infection,  antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be administered after 2 to 8 weeks of antifungal therapy in all patients who are clinically stable. Primary and secondary  prophylaxis  of  penicilliosis  marneffei  can  be  discontinued  in patients receiving ART and with CD4 + cell counts of > 100 cells/mm 3 for at least 6 months [22]. However, antifungal prophylaxis should be reintroduced if the CD4 + count decreases to < 100 cells/mm 3 .
