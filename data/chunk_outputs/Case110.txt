190  countries  signed  up  to  the  Millennium  Development  Goals (MDGs) with two goals specifically  targeted  towards  maternal and child health (Table 16-1). Very clearly defined and pertinent indicators to  monitor  progress  towards these goals were  also  agreed.  For MDG  5,  the  monitoring  framework  was  revised  during  the  2005 World Summit to include one new target (5b) and four new indicators (5.3-5.6) (Table 16-2).
Politically,  there  is  increased  attention  directed  towards  maternal health  and  many  countries  now  see  the  status  of  maternal  and newborn health as a signal or 'litmus test' of the degree of functionality of their health system as a whole. But has progress been made and can MDG 5 be achieved? Medically speaking, the answer is yes-we know what is needed and we know what to do in case of complications of pregnancy and childbirth [3]. An agreed 'continuum of care' that includes antenatal care, delivery care and postnatal care needs to be available and accessible to women [4]. The availability of Skilled Birth  Attendance  and  Emergency  (Essential)  Obstetric  Care  for  all women all over the world are seen as key [5]. This is in addition to basic neonatal care and family planning.

GENERAL INTRODUCTION
Each year, at least 358,000 women worldwide die from complications of  pregnancy  and  childbirth  [1].  Many  more  survive  but  suffer  ill health and disability as a result of these complications. Ninety-nine percent of all maternal deaths occur in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, an estimated 4 million neonatal deaths occur each year, accounting for almost 40% of all deaths under the age of 5 years [2]. The health of the neonate is closely related to that of the mother and the majority of deaths in the first  month of life could be prevented if interventions were in place to ensure good maternal health.
There  have  been  significant  global  efforts  to  reduce  maternal  and newborn mortality and morbidity in the last few decades. The 'Safe Motherhood  Initiative'  was  launched  in  Nairobi  in  1987.  One  of its  stated  aims  was  to  reduce  maternal  mortality  by  50%  by  the year 2000. However, figures at the turn of the millennium remained disappointingly unchanged from the start of the initiative. This was partly  because  of  better  data  collection  and  documentation  of  the problems, and also because reducing maternal and newborn health requires  a  coordinated  and multifaceted  approach.

MATERNAL MORTALITY
The number of maternal deaths in a population is related both to the risk of mortality associated with each pregnancy or birth (reflected in the maternal mortality ratio, which is the number of maternal deaths per  number  live  births, × 100,000)  and the  number of pregnancies experienced by women of reproductive age [reflected in the maternal mortality rate, which is the number of maternal deaths per number of women of reproductive age (taken as 15-49), × 100,000].
There is still a lack of accurate data, especially from developing countries where maternal mortality is high. In the absence of complete and accurate civil registration systems, which are almost non-existent in resource-poor  settings,  maternal  mortality  ratios  and  rates  are  estimated based on a variety of methods, including household surveys, 'sisterhood'  methods,  reproductive  age  mortality  studies,  censuses and modeling. Since 1990, using all available data and/or statistical modeling,  estimates  have  been  developed  by  the  United  Nations (UN) agencies which allow for international comparison and analysis of progress. The latest estimates from 2008 show that of the 358,000 maternal deaths that are estimated to occur annually, the vast majority occur in developing countries. Almost two-thirds are in sub-Saharan Africa (207,000) followed by South Asia (139,000) (Table 16-3).
Analysis of trend shows that at the global level, the decrease in maternal  mortality  between  1990  and  2008  was  estimated  to  be  2.3% overall,  which  is  well  below  the  estimated  5.5%  decrease  needed annually to achieve MDG 5 by 2015 [6].

CAUSES OF MATERNAL MORTALITYWHY DO WOMEN DIE?
A seminal review by Thaddeus and Maine in 1994 introduced the 'Three Delay Model' [7]. They acknowledged that there are numerous factors that contribute to maternal mortality and that when obstetric complications occur, with prompt adequate treatment, the outcome is usually satisfactory. They therefore examined the factors that affect the interval between the onset of an obstetric complication and its outcome. The three delays described and examined are: (i) delay in deciding to seek care; (ii) delay in reaching the healthcare facility; and, (iii) delay in receiving care after getting to the healthcare facility. This framework is now widely used to examine and address factors contributing to maternal deaths in many countries (Box 16.1).
Medically,  the  main  direct  causes  of  maternal  deaths  are  obstetric hemorrhage, hypertensive disorders (eclampsia and pre-eclampsia), sepsis or infection, and complications of obstructed labour and abortion.  There  is  some  variation  both  across  and  within  geographical regions (Figs 16.1 and 16.2) [8]. Based on the need for much better identification and understanding of the causes of maternal deaths, a World  Health Organization  (WHO)  Technical  Working  Group

examined and reached a consensus on a new classification system for cause of maternal death in 2009. This new classification is aligned with International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 10 and will feed into the new ICD 1 1 system of classification [9].

============================================================
HEMORRHAGE
Obstetric haemorrhage is the most commonly documented cause of maternal death. This can take the form of antepartum bleeding (e.g. as  a  result  of  placenta  praevia or placental abruption), intrapartum bleeding  (e.g.  as  a  result  of  rupture  of  the  uterus)  or  post-partum hemorrhage (e.g. as a result of atony of the uterus, associated with disseminated vascular coagulopathy, or trauma to the genital tract). Any bleeding during pregnancy and delivery should be considered a 'danger' or warning sign and requires urgent attention.
Placental abruption can occur suddenly and unexpectedly. In many resource-poor settings, in the absence of ultrasonography, the warning signs of bleeding, coupled with the clinical sign of a 'uterus en bois' (woody hard uterus which feels contracted), will alert the healthcare provider to this emergency. In the case of placenta previa, a cesarean section is needed.
Post-partum hemorrhage is commonly defined as blood loss of more than 500 ml and severe post-partum hemorrhage as a loss of more than 1000 ml. Most cases are unpredictable and it is vital that there is  early recognition of excess blood loss and immediate action. The majority of cases are the result of uterine atony post-delivery, either after  vaginal  delivery  or  cesarean  section.  The  recommended  treatment  is  uterotonics  (drugs  to  stimulate  uterine  contraction)  and prompt replacement of volume lost to avoid hypovolemic shock.
There are a number of uterotonics available, including oxytocin and ergometrine (the traditional and well-proven first-line approach), as well as more recent prostaglandins, such as carboprost and misoprostol. Blood transfusion is frequently needed and many women in

FIGURE 16.2 Causes of maternal deaths in Asia.
resource-poor areas do not survive hemorrhage because blood transfusion services are not available at all or insufficient blood is given. In addition, in cases of hemorrhage as a result of coagulopathy, such as is associated with abruption placenta and eclampsia, the availability of blood is crucial.

============================================================
CHUNK 11
============================================================
HEMORRHAGE
It may be necessary to explore the uterus for retained placental tissue. Retained placenta is a common problem leading to post-partum hemorrhage and all skilled birth attendants need to be able to carry out a manual removal of placenta under suitable analgesia (or anesthesia) and/or refer a woman with this condition to a higher level facility in good time. Retained placental tissue and/or membranes can lead to prolonged bleeding and high risk of infection. This requires careful exploration of the uterus under anesthesia and curettage. For hemorrhage occurring after a cesarean section, re-laparotomy may be necessary to check that this is not the result of unrecognized tears in the uterus and/or faulty surgical technique. In some cases with unstoppable hemorrhage, the only solution may be to perform a (subtotal) hysterectomy.
Post-partum hemorrhage can be prevented-it is recommended that all women have active management of the third stage of labor. This consists of administering a uterotonic (preferably oxytocin intramuscularly) at the time of delivery, together with clamping and cutting the  cord  and  controlled  cord  traction  (gentle  cord  traction  with manual support of the uterus) to deliver the placenta. The oxytocin is given at the time of birth of the anterior shoulder; if it is not known whether this could be a multiple pregnancy, it should be given at the time of the birth of the baby, after checking there is no second baby. In some cases, this is combined with uterine massage or fundal pressure  after  delivery  of  the  placenta.  The  routine  administration  of oxytocin  reduces  the  risk  of  hemorrhage  by  more  than  half  when compared with 'physiologic' or expectant management (i.e. no oxytocic, no controlled cord traction, with the cord being clamped and cut after the placenta has been delivered by maternal effort only).

============================================================
CHUNK 12
============================================================
PRE-ECLAMPSIA AND ECLAMPSIA
Pre-eclampsia  (hypertension  with  proteinuria)  is  specific  to  pregnancy and will progress to eclampsia (convulsions) if unrecognized. There  is  some  evidence  that  eclampsia  may  be  more  common  in certain developing countries, but good epidemiologic data are scarce. Pre-eclampsia is a multi-organ disease with unknown etiology. Early detection of hypertension and proteinuria is important and measurement  of  blood  pressure  with  examination  of  urine  must  be  done regularly during pregnancy, delivery and the postnatal period. Severe pre-eclampsia is associated with clinical signs and symptoms such as headache,  visual  disturbances,  upper  epigastric  pain  and  hyperreflexia. An eclamptic convulsion is essentially the same as an epileptic  fit  with  tonic  and clonic seizures. Recurrent seizures can lead to maternal death but, most commonly, death is probably the result of intracerebral hemorrhage following untreated hypertension.
Delivery of the fetus and placenta is the 'cure' for pre eclampsia and eclampsia, and, in many instances, a careful balance of risks needs to be made, especially if the fetus is premature. In addition to planning a timely delivery, magnesium sulfate has been consistently shown to be the  drug  of choice for pre-eclampsia in a number of important trials  that  included  developing  country  populations.  Magnesium sulfate can be given either intramuscularly or intravenously in cases of severe pre-eclampsia (to prevent eclampsia) and in eclampsia (to prevent  seizures).  Dosage  can  be  monitored  by  checking  the  deep tendon reflexes and monitoring respiratory rate; absence of reflexes and respiratory depression indicate over-dosage.

============================================================
CHUNK 13
============================================================
PRE-ECLAMPSIA AND ECLAMPSIA
Anti-hypertensive  treatment  must  be  given  in  pre-eclampsia  and eclampsia.  There  are  a  variety  of  drugs  available-all  with  proven benefit-including hydralazine (commonly preferred first-line drug), nifedipine and labetalol. Drugs often need to be given intravenously and may be combined with oxytocin, for example, to induce labor. Fluid input and output must be carefully monitored in the patient with  pre-eclampsia  and  eclampsia.  Cardiopulmonary  overload  is  a frequent complication, especially when oxytocin (antidiuretic effect) is needed to induce labor. In addition, pre-eclampsia (a multi-organ disease)  may  be  associated  with  kidney  failure  with  reduced  urine output.

============================================================
CHUNK 14
============================================================
SEPSIS
Most maternal deaths from infection occur in the postnatal period as a result of puerperal sepsis defined as 'a temperature rise above 38.5 degrees  Celsius  maintained  over  24  hours  or  recurring  during  the period  from  the  end  of  the  first  to  the  end  of  the  tenth  day  after childbirth  or  after  abortion' .  Clinical  signs  and  symptoms  include fever, lower abdominal pain and uterine tenderness, subinvolution of the uterus with foul smelling, sometimes purulent, discharge with or without vaginal bleeding. Failure to recognize and manage puerperal sepsis early on will lead to septic shock and coagulopathy.
The  clinical  diagnosis  of  sepsis  is  relatively  simple  and  does  not require laboratory tests. In practice, fever in the post-partum period is  often  attributed  solely  to  malaria,  especially  in  malaria-endemic areas. Full clinical examination and a thick film slide will help with the differential diagnosis, as will the realization that, in many postpartum women, such fever is more likely to be associated with puerperal  sepsis  than  malaria.  Parenteral  antibiotics  are  needed  and generally  given  for  24-48  hours.  There  are  various  recommended regimens but in the absence of availability of blood-culture testing (as in  most  resource-poor  areas),  the  best  combination  is  ampicillin, gentamycin  and  metronidazol.  The  presence  of  retained  placental fragments and/or fetal tissue in the case of abortion must be considered. Poor hygiene during delivery, during obstetric surgery, such as cesarean section or evacuation of the uterus (for termination of pregnancy or removal of retained products after an incomplete abortion), can  all  lead  to  puerperal  sepsis.  Good  hand-washing  practice  and adequate sterilization of equipment used during surgical procedures are  crucial  preventive  measures.  Prophylactic  antibiotics  should  be given in all cases of cesarean section. Infection with HIV is associated with reduced immunity, an increased risk of opportunistic infections and reported increased difficulty in treating post-partum sepsis, either after delivery or cesarean section.

============================================================
CHUNK 15
============================================================
COMPLICATIONS OF OBSTRUCTED LABOR
Obstructed labor is a condition contributing to maternal death in a number of ways, for example via haemorrhage as a result of rupture of the uterus or via sepsis. Morbidity associated with obstructed labor includes obstetric fistulae (vesico-vaginal and/or rectal). Obstructed labor is said to occur when there are good uterine contractions but there  is  no  descent  of  the  fetus  through  the  pelvis.  This  may  be because the fetus is too large for the pelvis (fetopelvic disproportion) and/or there are pelvic abnormalities  (e.g.  associated with  rickets). Malposition of the fetus or congenital fetal abnormalities (e.g. hydrocephalus) can also be associated with obstructed labor. Clinical signs of rupture of the uterus include vaginal bleeding, hypovolemic shock, tender abdomen, an abnormal uterine contour, absent fetal heart and easily palpable fetal parts. A 'Bandl's' ring can often be seen prior to rupture  of  the  uterus  and  is  a  visible  horizontal  depression  in  the lower  abdominal  contour  near  the  umbilicus  which  indicates  the marcation between the thick muscular upper uterine segment and a very thin, stretched out lower uterine segment.
In  cases  of  obstructed labor,  in order to save both  the mother and baby's lives, a timely cesarean section is needed. For this, the woman will need to be delivered in a health facility providing all the nine signal functions of Comprehensive Essential Obstetric Care (see Box 16.2) and referral may be needed if she is laboring at a lower-level facility. Such referral must be well organized and requires transport and communication systems to be in place.
Obstructed  labor  can  be  detected  by  using  a  partograph.  This  is  a simple structured graphical one-page representation of the progress of a woman's labor and is recommended as a tool to monitor progress in all women during labor, as well as a documentation of the fetal condition. It consists of a graph depicting cervical dilatation in relation to time-in most cases also the degree of descent of the fetal presenting part-the strength and frequency of contractions and the

============================================================
CHUNK 18
============================================================
ABORTION
Each year many women die as a result of unsafe abortions [10]. The WHO defines  unsafe  abortion  as  'a  procedure  for  terminating  an unintended  pregnancy  either  by  individuals  without  the  necessary skills or in an environment that does not conform to minimal medical standards, or both' . Important causes of death include hemorrhage, infection and self-poisoning. Legalization of abortion and the availability of good-quality abortion services and post-abortion care have reduced the mortality in a number of countries.
The  development  of  simple  techniques  and  equipment,  such  as needed for manual vacuum aspiration to remove retained products of conception in the case of incomplete abortion (miscarriage) or to carry out termination of pregnancy where this is possible, have helped increase the availability of such services.
Many unwanted and unplanned pregnancies could be avoided with improved availability and access to effective contraceptives. Statistical models show that higher contraceptive prevalence and greater use of effective contraceptive methods will result in a reduced incidence of abortion. Where these are not available, women will seek to terminate their unintended pregnancies, despite a lack of safe abortion services and restrictive legislation.  Restrictive legislation is associated with a high  incidence of unsafe  abortions,  reluctance  of  women to access facilities  when  there  are  complications  of  abortion  and  of  staff  to extend services needed to manage complications of an unsafe abortion. Ensuring family planning services are accessible and available is part of the 'continuum of care' that needs to be in place to improve women's health.

============================================================
CHUNK 19
============================================================
NEONATAL MORTALITY
Global estimates obtained from limited data and statistical modeling indicate that there are approximately 5.8 million perinatal deaths, 3 million stillbirths, 2.8 million early neonatal deaths and 3.7 million neonatal deaths (early and late) annually. Neonatal deaths account for up to 40% of mortality of those under the age of five years. Probably, around 75% of all neonatal deaths occur in the first week of life [1 1].  Although  good  data  are  scarce,  the  main  causes  of  neonatal deaths in developing countries are thought to be prematurity (28%), infection (26%) and asphyxia (23%). These are all directly related to maternal health. Many of these deaths could be prevented with skilled birth attendance and access to essential obstetric and newborn care.
The majority of data available report on outcomes  related to birth weight.  The  most  important  predictor  of  birth  weight  is,  however, likely to be gestational age at time of birth. Recent articles report that the incidence of preterm birth (delivery before 37 weeks gestation) in many resource-poor populations is higher than in richer countries, with current estimates varying between 17% and 25%. It is difficult to prevent preterm labor occurring, but the administration of corticosteroids to the mother to enhance fetal lung maturity, as well as provision of Kangaroo Mother Care (See Chapter 17) are evidencebased interventions that will improve outcome.
Where infection is considered the cause of neonatal death, this has been documented as sepsis or septicemia, meningitis, pneumonia or acute respiratory tract infection, or simply as 'neonatal infection' . The causative organisms are rarely known and there is substantial uncertainty about the relative contribution and/or exact cause of death of the neonates in this category. Neonatal death owing to asphyxia can be the result of inability to resuscitate a baby with low apgar scores and neonatal encephalopathy with fits or coma. Many of these deaths include fresh stillbirths which could have been prevented with better monitoring of the fetal condition during labour (e.g. using the partograph)  and  expedited  delivery  where  necessary.  Neonatal  tetanus accounts for around 7% of deaths. With vaccination of women in the antenatal period and clean cord care this can be prevented.

============================================================
SKILLED BIRTH ATTENDANCE
A Skilled Birth Attendant is defined as:
'…an accredited health professional - such as a midwife, doctor or nurse with midwifery skills, who has been educated and trained to proficiency in the  skills needed to manage normal (uncomplicated) pregnancies, childbirth and the immediate postnatal period, and in the  identification,  management  and  referral  of  complications  in women and newborns' .
The term 'Skilled Birth  Attendance'  includes the  person (a  skilled attendant)  and  an  'enabling environment' .  This  enabling  environment is less  well-defined  but  refers  to  a  functioning  health  system within  which  the  skilled  birth  attendant  can  work  effectively  and includes infrastructure, equipment, drugs and a functioning referral system.  Global  progress  towards  the  availability  and  use  of  skilled birth attendants is being made, with an increase between 1990 and 2000 in births attended by a skilled worker (from 45% to 54%) in developing  countries,  with  the  exception  of  South  Asia  and  subSaharan Africa [12]. In 2008, globally, an average of 65.7% of births were  attended  by  a  skilled  health  worker.  Developed  countries had  over  99%  coverage,  while  East  Africa  had  the  least  coverage (33.7%), with 41.2% coverage in Western Africa, and 46.9% in South Central Asia.
With a heavy reliance on the proportion of births attended by a skilled attendant as the key indicator for measuring progress towards reducing maternal mortality, there is also need for an agreed monitoring and evaluation framework to inform policy makers on progress and impact of this strategy. Available evidence from around the world has shown that improving the recruitment, education, training and supervision of skilled attendants, as well as the provision of an enabling environment are all positive and crucial steps.

============================================================
ESSENTIAL OBSTETRIC AND NEWBORN CARE
For an estimated 10-15% of all women, a potentially life-threatening complication  develops  during  pregnancy,  childbirth  or  the  postpartum period. In most cases, this complication will be unexpected and unpredictable. Therefore, it is crucial that all women have access to good-quality essential (or emergency) obstetric care.
At least 80% of all maternal deaths result from five complications that are well understood and can be readily treated: hemorrhage, sepsis, eclampsia, ruptured uterus as a result of obstructed labor and complications of abortion; there are existing effective medical and surgical interventions that are relatively inexpensive. In 1997, the key interventions needed were bundled into a package now known as 'Essential (or  Emergency) Obstetric Care' (Box 16.2).  There is  unified agreement and criteria for what constitutes Essential Obstetric Care, as well as on what constitutes the minimum coverage levels needed at population  level  and  on  what  constitutes  good-quality  evidence  based practice [13-15].
Two  levels  of  Essential  (Emergency)  Obstetric  Care  can  be  distinguished: Basic Essential Obstetric Care and Comprehensive Essential Obstetric Care. In addition to agreement on the components (signal functions),  there  are  agreed  specifications  for  levels  of  coverage needed. Thus, the UN agencies recommend that, for a population of 500,000, there should be at least one health facility that is able to provide the nine signal functions of comprehensive care and at least four that provide the seven signal functions of basic care. It is important that these facilities are equitably distributed geographically with regard to distance and time needed to travel to the health facility. In addition, the signal functions must be available 24 hours a day and 7 days a week for the facility to be considered fully functional.
A number of surveys have assessed the availability, accessibility and quality  of  essential  obstetric  care  in  countries  with  high  maternal mortality. These surveys consistently find that coverage with facilities able to provide care is inadequate and minimum UN agreed standards are not yet in place. In many settings, there are relatively large numbers of health facilities but these are often not providing the full complement of signal  functions  for  either  basic  or  comprehensive essential obstetric care. In addition, the geographical distribution of facilities is such that these tend to be clustered in urban areas with poor coverage particularly in more rural areas [16].

============================================================
CHUNK 22
============================================================
QUALITY OF CARE
There is accumulating evidence that poor-quality care (or the third delay, as defined by the 'three delay model') contributes significantly to adverse maternal and newborn outcomes in resource poor areas. Quality  of  Care  should  include  the  concept  of  effective  care  and timely access, and of reproductive health rights.
The quality of the provision of care and the quality of care as experienced by users are both essential components (Box 16.3). The use of services and outcomes are the result not only of the provision of care but also of women's experience of that care. Provision of care may be deemed of high quality against recognized standards of care but unacceptable to the woman and her family (the community). Conversely, some aspects of care may be popular with women but may be ineffective or harmful to health.
For maternal and newborn health in particular, there are well established tools for assessing and improving quality of care. These include maternal and perinatal death audit, 'near miss' audit and standards

============================================================
CHUNK 23
============================================================
BOX 16.3  Quality of Care
'Quality of care is the degree to which maternal health services for individuals and populations increase the likelihood of  timely  and  appropriate  treatment  for  the  purpose  of achieving  desired  outcomes  that  are  both  consistent  with current professional knowledge and uphold basic reproductive rights.' (Hulton, 2010)
'The question should not be why do women not accept the service that we o3er, but why do we not o3er a service that women will accept.' (Fathalla, 1998).
(or criterion-) based audit. These tools have been successfully used in a variety of settings and such audit is recommended as part of everyday good clinical practice. All types of audit essentially ask the questions: what was done well, what was not done well and how can care be improved in future [17, 18]?
An  absolutely  fundamental  principle  is  the  importance  of  a  nonthreatening  environment  and  a  'no  shame,  no  blame'  approach. Wherever  possible,  confidentiality  and  anonymity  must  be  maintained. Death reviews-conducted in this way-should result in recommendations for change. Such recommendations need to be (and in practice usually are) simple, affordable, effective and in line with evidence-based care.
Confidential  enquiries  are  a  systematic,  usually  multidisciplinary, anonymous  review  of  all  or  a  representative  sample  of  maternal deaths occurring in  an  area,  for  example national  or  sub-national. Through aggregation of data, a confidential enquiry can make recommendations of a more general nature, inform wider health policy and practice,  and  can  be  used  for  advocacy  to  improve  maternal  and newborn health.
