typhus is misleading, as the disease can be contracted in many other habitats, including primary forest, beaches, gardens, and plantations. Indian patients with scrub typhus are more likely to have lived close to bushes and wood piles, to have worked on farms, to have seen rodents and to have reared domestic animals, but are less likely to wash  or  change  clothes  after  work.  For  Koreans,  wearing  a  longsleeved shirt while working, keeping work clothes off the grass and always using a mat to rest on outdoors were protective [4].
The most commonly reported serotypes are Karp, Kato, Gilliam, and Boryong, but the wide phenotypic and genotypic diversity of Orientia tsutsugamushi has major implications for the design of diagnostic tests and vaccines [1].

NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
Scrub  typhus  is  transmitted  by  chiggers  -  the  third-stage  larvae  of Leptotombidium mites (Fig. 63.2), which feed on the extracellular fluid of vertebrates such as rodents and humans. Mites are the main reservoir of O. tsutsugamushi , with the organisms maintained in the population by transovarial transmission. Blood transfusion and needlestick injury have been recorded as transmitting scrub typhus.
The genome of O. tsutsugamushi (~2 million bp) is much larger than that  of  other  members  of  Rickettsiaceae  and  is  the  most  highly repeated  bacterial  genome  sequenced  [1].  The  median O.  tsutsugamushi DNA load in blood is low (~13 [0-310,253] copies/ml); approximately half of patients have bacterial loads undetectable by current techniques [5]. Post-mortem examination has demonstrated O. tsutsugamushi in  endothelial  cells  of  major  organs.  Significantly higher concentrations of gamma interferon and interleukin-10 occur during the  acute  than  the  convalescent  phase.  Comparison  of  patterns  of endothelial and leukocyte activation in a range of 'typhus-like' illnesses suggest mononuclear cell activation in scrub typhus. Evidence is accumulating that O. tsutsugamushi exhibits tropism for mononuclear cells rather than endothelial cells, at least in early infection [6]. Intriguingly, evidence from Thailand suggests that HIV-1-suppressive factors are produced during some scrub typhus infections.

CLINICAL FEATURES
The incubation period is approximately 6-14 days. Ten to fifty percent of patients may have an eschar - this variability probably reflects, at least  in  part,  the  extent  to  which  patients  are  examined.  Eschars, which are usually single and in secluded areas such as the axilla and groin, are painless, erythematous papules that develop a central black scab, resembling a cigarette burn (Fig. 63.3). They are not pathognomonic for scrub typhus, as similar lesions may be produced by spotted fever group  rickettsioses. Chiggers are minute and, unlike ticks, are not normally noticed. Patients may scratch off the characteristic black scab. Lymphadenopathy is more frequent than in sympatric murine typhus  [2].  Headache,  myalgia,  and  dry  cough  frequently  occur;  a maculopapular erythematous rash occurs in a minority  of  patients [1,2].  Deafness,  tinnitus,  and  conjunctival  suffusion  occur.

INTRODUCTION
Scrub typhus was described in Japan in the 1800s and then in Malaysia in the 1920s, where it was distinguished from murine typhus. It was a major clinical problem in many Asian theaters of the Second World  War  and  the  Indochina  Wars  [1].  Management  was  transformed  by  chloramphenicol  and  tetracyclines.  It  remains  a  major, under-appreciated cause of undifferentiated fever in Asia. Diagnosis is greatly hampered by the lack of accurate and accessible laboratory diagnosis.  Given  the  large  populations  of  India  and  China,  the numbers potentially exposed are enormous. With the growth of ecotourism in Asia, more travelers are returning to  non-endemic areas with this disease.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Scrub typhus occurs in the most populous rural areas of the world - across 13,000,000 km 2 from the Pacific rim, Southeast Asia, northern Australia and Northeast Asia across South and Central Asia as far west as Uzbekistan and including the Maldives (Fig. 63.1) [1]. This has been conventionally called the 'scrub typhus triangle', but it is more of a rhomboid than a triangle. There are no reliable estimates of community incidence and most are hospital-derived, such as recent data that 3% of patients in Nepal and 15% of patients in Laos admitted with undifferentiated fever had scrub typhus [2, 3]. It predominantly afflicts farmers, including their children, but may also affect urban populations through exposure in gardens or visits to the countryside. There are no known genetic predispositions. The name scrub

disease  can  manifest  as pneumonitis,  acute  respiratory  distress syndrome,  jaundice  with  mildly  raised  transaminases,  meningoencephalitis, coagulopathy, multi-organ failure, acute renal failure, acute transverse myelitis,  myocarditis, and Guillain-Barré  syndrome. Why some, and not others, develop severe disease is not understood. Mortality  is  positively  correlated  with  blood  bacterial load  [5]. Orientia tsutsugamushi DNA  has  been  demonstrated  in  cerebrospinal  fluid (CSF),  with  normal  glucose,  a  mild  increase  in  white  cell  density (ranging from 11-88% lymphocytes) and raised protein [7]. Scrub typhus appears to be less severe in children, but there have been no

prospective comparisons between children and adults from the same population. Scrub typhus can cause serious adverse effects for mother and baby in pregnancy [8]. Although homologous strain immunity persists  for  at  least  1-3  years,  immunity  to  heterologous Orientia strains is as short as 1 month. There are few data on the dynamics of IgM/IgG responses - the annual reversion of scrub typhus patients sera back to a titer of < 1  :  50 was 61% [9].

PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The majority of scrub typhus patients are not diagnosed or treated. A patient  with  fever,  headache,  and  myalgia  with  an  eschar  in  an endemic area is likely to have scrub typhus. The differential diagnosis would include spotted fever group rickettsiosis, which would also be expected to respond to tetracyclines. Scrub typhus eschars could be confused  with  the  lesions  of  anthrax,  tularemia,  chancroid,  lymphogranuloma venereum, and injury. In the absence of an eschar, few clinical  features  are  helpful.  Murine  typhus,  leptospirosis,  Q  fever, dengue, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), infectious mononucleosis, HIV seroconversion, septicemia (especially typhoid), and malaria are important differential diagnoses. In comparison with those with Q fever, Taiwanese patients with scrub typhus had a higher frequency of residence or travel in a mountainous region or offshore island,  and  skin  rash.  In  comparison  to  HFRS  in  China,  eschar, regional  lymphadenopathy  and  maculopapular  rash  were  more

commonly found in patients with scrub typhus. In Laos, the presence of peripheral lymphadenopathy, chest signs and eschars are clinically useful signs that suggest scrub, rather than murine, typhus [2].
Laboratory diagnosis of scrub typhus is difficult. Culture (requiring BSL3 facilities) is 100% specific, but has low sensitivity. Immunofluorescence (IFA)  and immunoperoxidase IgM and IgG antibody tests have been commonly used, but these are expensive, rarely accessible and are bedevilled by subjectivity of interpretation and uncertainty as to the most appropriate cut-off titers in different communities [10]. Ideally, they should be interpreted by comparing titers between paired acute and convalescent samples. Karp, Gilliam, and Kato prototypic antigens are usually used in IFAs and therefore may not detect antibodies to other strains. The Weil-Felix OXK test is still commonly used in Asia, but has low sensitivity. Conventional and quantitative realtime PCR assays for the detection of O. tsutsugamushi in blood, eschar tissue, and CSF have been developed [1 1, 12]. However, there remain great difficulties in the accessibility of the diagnosis of scrub typhus in rural endemic areas. Mixed infections may occur with, for example, leptospirosis but, given the persistence of antibodies, distinguishing these  from  serial  infections  without  culture  or  PCR  techniques  is difficult.

CHUNK 12
============================================================
TREATMENT
Given the difficulties of making a timely laboratory diagnosis and the significant minority who develop severe disease, empirical treatment should be considered for all cases with scrub typhus in the differential diagnosis. The diversity of O. tsutsugamushi suggests it is unlikely that one treatment regimen will be appropriate across the wide distribution  of  this  organism.  Chloramphenicol-  and  doxycycline-resistant scrub typhus have been described in northern Thailand [13], but there are no subsequent published data on this clinical problem.
Interpretation  of  data  informing  treatment  decisions  is  difficult,  as studies are few, often of small sample size and 'relapses' were usually not proven to be relapses of scrub typhus, rather than another cause of fever (Table 63-1). Current data suggest that fluoroquinolones are inferior to doxycycline as therapy for scrub typhus. For uncomplicated disease, the data available do not allow generalizable conclusions of the  duration  of  doxycycline  therapy  or  whether  a  loading  dose  is required. In Laos and Thailand, a 7-day treatment course of 2 mg/kg twice daily after a loading dose of 4 mg/kg is administered. There is evidence from Malaysia that shorter courses may be efficacious [14]. Upper gastrointestinal side effects are common; patients should be counseled to take doxycycline with plenty of fluid, during meals, and while sitting or standing. Chloramphenicol, telithromycin, rifampicin, and azithromycin are potential alternatives [15-20].
There are few data to guide the antibiotic treatment of severe disease - parenteral or nasogastric doxycycline or chloramphenicol are potential  options. Appropriate supportive care is essential. The treatment of  scrub  typhus  in  pregnancy  is  problematic  -  chloramphenicol (although contraindicated  in  the  last  trimester),  azithromycin,  and rifampicin have been used. In children, the risks of short-course doxycycline are almost certainly exceeded by the benefit of effective cure. In a retrospective analysis of children with scrub typhus, no significant differences in fever clearance times were found between doxycycline, chloramphenicol, or roxithromycin therapy [21].

TREATMENT
Mortality is very variable, ranging from 0-60% in untreated patients, for  reasons  that  are unclear. Delayed administration of doxycycline has  been  associated  with  major  organ  dysfunction  and  prolonged hospitalization, emphasizing the importance of early empirical doxycycline therapy. Relapse was described during volunteer experiments in Malaysia, but whether this is an important phenomenon in clinical practice is uncertain. Insecticides have been used to control chiggers, both in high-risk habitats and on blankets and clothes, but neither
are currently practical in rural Asia for farmers (who are at most risk of scrub typhus). For short-term adult visitors, weekly 200 mg doxycycline reduces the risk of contracting scrub typhus. There is currently no safe and effective vaccine available.
