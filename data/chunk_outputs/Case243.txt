INTRODUCTION
The term tropics refers to the region of earth lying between the Tropic  of  Cancer  and  the Tropic  of  Capricorn.  In  the  tropics, warm  climate,  poverty,  lack  of  education,  and  poor  sanitation provide an ideal environment for pathogens, vectors, and intermediate hosts to |ourish. 1 In this vast landmass, respiratory infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Respiratory infections may be due to  common pathogens encountered  worldwide,  as well as mycobacterial, parasitic, and fungal organisms. Infections are more prominent in immunocompromised hosts. On the other hand, non-communicable diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], chronic respiratory diseases, lung cancer, occupational lung diseases) are increasingly recognized in the tropics, where low socio-economic, educational, and nutritional status favor worse prognosis. A reasonable approach to the patient with lung disease in the tropics starts with age, occupational exposure, physical examination, HIV status, chest x-ray, and blood tests.

PNEUMONIA
World Health Organization (WHO) data showed that pneumonia is the leading cause of death in children under 5 years of age, and is  responsible  for  16%  of  deaths  (Fig.  1.1). The  incidence  and mortality in the  tropics  are  particularly  increased, especially  in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa (Fig. 1.2). In T anzania, 85% of children with suspected pneumonia are taken for care; however, proper care depends on family income, with the richest families seeking care 9.5 times more often. In Ethiopia only 30% of children with pneumonia were taken for care in a facility or in the community. 2 WHO data reveal that as few as 39% of newborns are breastfed, 60% of children with suspected pneumonia access care, and  31%  receive  antibiotics.  Poor  vaccination,  sanitation,  and nutrition; crowded homes; indoor air pollution; and smoking all adversely affect pneumonia outcomes in the tropics.
Common  pathogens  include  bacteria,  viruses,  and  fungi. Streptococcus  pneumoniae is  the  most  common bacterial  cause  of pneumonia followed by Haemophilus inRuenzae type b. Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia accounts for 2% to 10% of acute communityacquired pneumonias.
Atypical pneumonias caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella spp., viruses, fungi, and parasites occur. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common etiology of viral  pneumonia. In HIV-infected infants, fungal pneumonia due to Pneumocystis jirovecii (formerly P. carinii ) accounts for 25% of all pneumonia deaths. M. pneumoniae infections occur worldwide, affecting mostly school-aged children and young adults. The tropical physician should be aware of the non-respiratory manifestations of mycoplasma infection, including anemia, myringitis, StevensJohnson syndrome, hepatitis, and neuritis.

PNEUMONIA
In 2002 to 2003, a coronavirus was responsible for more than 8000 cases of a severe acute respiratory  syndrome (SARS) that spread via international travel across continents from its origin in  Guangdong Province, China. After droplet inhalation of the virus, there was an incubation period of 2 to 7 days, then fever, cough,  malaise,  and  headache.  Pulmonary  in|ammation  was characterized by desquamation of pneumocytes, hyaline membrane formation,  and  acute  respiratory  distress  syndrome  (ARDS). Recovery  could  be  slow,  and  some  patients  developed  {brosis. Mortality  was  10%  to  20%,  with  the  elderly  and  those  with cardiovascular problems being especially at risk.
In 2012 another novel coronavirus appeared in Saudi Arabia, named Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Between 2012 and 2017, 2040 laboratory-con{rmed cases have been reported to WHO, with small outbreaks outside of the Middle East. T ransmission has occurred from human to human, but requires close contact and has particularly been seen in health care facilities between patients or between patients and health care providers. A dromedary camel reservoir is postulated. Initial symptoms are fever, cough, and shortness of breath, with disease severity ranging from asymptomatic or mild common cold symptoms to SARS. Thirty-{ve percent of con{rmed cases have died.
In|uenza viruses with pandemic potential are a risk for global disease spread. 3 East Asia has seen continued outbreaks of avian in|uenza (e.g., H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2) with occasional spread to humans. In 2009-2010, a swine in|uenza virus (H1N1) originating in Mexico led to a global pandemic.

Investigations and Management
Sputum  examination  is  an  important  aid  in  the  diagnosis  of pneumonia: color, amount, consistency, and odor. Mucopurulent sputum is commonly found in bacterial pneumonia or bronchitis. Scanty, watery sputum is often noted in atypical pneumonia; 'rusty'

sputum is seen in pneumococcal pneumonia; and currant-jelly or dark-red  sputum  suggests Klebsiella  pneumoniae. Foul-smelling sputum is associated with anaerobic infections due to aspiration, lung abscess, and necrotizing pneumonia. A blood count usually reveals leukocytosis in bacterial pneumonia, a normal white cell count or leukopenia in viral infection, and eosinophilia in parasitic infection. When available, chest x-ray, serum procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein can be obtained (Fig. 1.3). Naso-pharyngeal swabs for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can help establish the diagnosis of speci{c viral infections if available.

============================================================
Investigations and Management
1.  Children with fast-breathing pneumonia with no chest in-drawing or general danger signs should be treated with oral amoxicillin: at least 40 mg/kg/dose twice daily (80 mg/kg/day) for 5 days. In areas with low HIV prevalence, give amoxicillin for 3 days. Children with fast-breathing pneumonia who fail on first-line treatment with amoxicillin should have the option of referral to a facility where there is appropriate second-line treatment.
2.  Children age 2-59 months with chest in-drawing pneumonia should be treated with oral amoxicillin: at least 40 mg/kg/dose twice daily for 5 days.
3.  Children aged 2-59 months with severe pneumonia should be treated with parenteral ampicillin (or penicillin) and gentamicin as a first-line treatment. Ampicillin: 50 mg/kg, or benzyl penicillin: 50,000 units per kg IM/IV every 6 hours for at least 5 days. Gentamicin: 7.5 mg/kg IM/IV once a day for at least 5 days. Ceftriaxone should be used as a second-line treatment in children with severe pneumonia having failed on the first-line treatment.
4.  Ampicillin (or penicillin when ampicillin is not available) plus gentamicin or ceftriaxone are recommended as a first-line antibiotic regimen for HIV-infected and HIV-exposed infants and for children under 5 years of age with chest in-drawing pneumonia or severe pneumonia. For HIV-infected and HIV-exposed infants and for children with chest in-drawing pneumonia or severe pneumonia who do not respond to treatment with ampicillin or penicillin plus gentamicin, ceftriaxone alone is recommended for use as second-line treatment.
5.  Empiric cotrimoxazole treatment for suspected Pneumocystis jirovecii (previously P. carinii ) pneumonia is recommended as an additional treatment for HIV-infected and HIV-exposed infants aged from 2 months up to 1 year with chest in-drawing or severe pneumonia. Empirical cotrimoxazole treatment for P. jirovecii pneumonia is not recommended for HIV-infected and HIV-exposed children over 1 year of age with chest in-drawing or severe pneumonia.

============================================================
CHUNK 7
============================================================
Investigations and Management
In children, the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness guidelines for treating pneumonia are recommended (T able 1.1). 4 Childhood pneumonia is now classi{ed in two classes: tachypnea and  chest  in-drawing  indicate  treatment  with  oral  antibiotics, whereas  severe  pneumonia  with  danger  signs  (hypothermia, unconsciousness, convulsions) requires intravenous treatment in hospital.
WHO's  strategy  to  reduce  pneumonia  burden  has  three components: protection, by promoting breastfeeding and vitamin A  supplementation;  prevention,  using  vaccines  for  measles, H. inRuenzae, pertussis, rotavirus, and S. pneumoniae and promoting handwashing,  sanitation,  HIV  prevention,  and  cotrimoxazole prophylaxis  in  HIV-infected  patients;  and  treatment,  securing care seeking, proper case management,  and  antibiotic administration.

============================================================
CHUNK 8
============================================================
TUBERCULOSIS
Tuberculosis (TB) is the most common infectious cause of death worldwide, surpassing both HIV and malaria. 5 In 2015, 10.4 million incident cases were reported worldwide-480,000 with multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). 6 About half of these cases come from the tropics (India, Indonesia, Pakistan, South Africa, Nigeria) (Fig.  1.4).  MDR-TB  as  well  as  extensively  drug-resistant  TB (XDR-TB) are increasing in African and Asian regions. 7
Morbidity  and  mortality  from  TB  increase  with  HIV  coinfection and concurrence of diabetes mellitus. Refugee and migrant camps are hot-spots for TB transmission and spread. In Africa, the Ebola virus epidemic reduced TB as well as measles vaccination and favored disease spread. In Africa, 31% of TB cases have HIV co-infection, rising to 50% in regions of southern Africa.
Strategies to control TB are to monitor children under 5 years of age with exposure to TB cases, diagnose TB in HIV-infected subjects, implement modern diagnostic tools such as Xpert MTB/ RIF that identi{es the presence of TB and rifampin resistance, and make available anti-tuberculous drugs.

PARASITIC AND OTHER PULMONARY INFECTIONS IN THE TROPICS
These  infections  include  malaria,  pulmonary  schistosomiasis, amebiasis, melioidosis, paragonimiasis, echinococcal cysts, Chagas disease, ascariasis, strongyloidiasis, {lariasis, and tropical eosinophilia (T able 1.2). 8-10 Individuals who come in contact with birds or animals may develop zoonoses such as tularemia, psittacosis, Q fever, and leptospirosis.
Leptospirosis is common in tropical areas where sanitation is poor and the water not adequately treated. Epidemics of leptospirosis  occur  after  high  rainfall  in  monsoon seasons  when  the water supply is contaminated by sewage or animal urine. About half of the patients with leptospirosis have fever, cough, hemoptysis,

PARASITIC AND OTHER PULMONARY INFECTIONS IN THE TROPICS
Melioidosis,  caused  by Burkholderia  pseudomallei, is  endemic in  Southeast  Asia  (Vietnam,  Cambodia,  Myanmar),  northern Australia, and West Africa. Melioidosis is hyperendemic in northern
Australia and in parts of northeastern Thailand and is an important cause  of  fatal  community-acquired  pneumonia.  Chronic  infection  in  patients  with cystic  {brosis  can  occur. 12 The  radiologic picture  of  upper  lobe  in{ltration  and  cavity  formation  can  be indistinguishable from TB. The mortality rate ranges from 20% to 50% but is higher in HIV-infected and immunocompromised hosts.
Respiratory symptoms of cough and chest pain in typhoid are present in up to 50% of cases at the onset of the disease. Pulmonary in{ltrates  may  be  associated  with  positive  sputum  cultures  for Salmonella typhi. A fever chart showing continuous fever is highly suggestive of enteric fever. Diagnosis may be dif{cult without the ability to culture blood and stool.
In brucellosis, the lungs are involved in about 5% to 10% of cases, usually after inhalation of organisms. Abnormalities include bronchopneumonia,  solitary  or  multiple  lung  nodes,  miliary interstitial lung disease, lung abscess, and pleural effusion. Organisms can be identi{ed on stains or sputum cultures.
Tularemia  is  a  generalized  infection  caused  by Francisella tularensis and occurs after skin or mucous membrane contact with infected mammals or through the bite of an arthropod, usually a tick or biting |y. Diagnosis should be considered when there is a skin ulcer associated with fever, generalized lymphadenopathy, cough, and signs of pneumonia. Pneumonia, either primary from inhalation of an infected aerosol or secondary to systemic infection, occurs in about 20% of cases.
Pneumonic  plague  is  less  common  than  either  bubonic  or septicemic  disease.  Nevertheless,  fatal  bronchopneumonia  can occur without lymphadenopathy and is characterized by watery, bloody sputum. A sputum Gram stain can show bipolar stunted
rods.  Pneumonic  plague  and  tularemic  pneumonia  should  be considered when a severe, rapidly progressive bronchopneumonia is reported in an endemic area and 'typical' bacterial pneumonias have been ruled out.

CHUNK 11
============================================================
PARASITIC AND OTHER PULMONARY INFECTIONS IN THE TROPICS
In slaughterhouses, meat-processing plants, and areas with sheep and goat husbandry, Q fever ( Coxiella burnetii ) can cause epidemics of atypical pneumonia. Inhalation of dried infected material is the chief source; fever, headache, and dry cough are the main symptoms. Occasionally, the sputum is blood-streaked.
Bornholm's disease (caused by coxsackie viruses and occasionally other enteroviruses), also known as epidemic pleurodynia or devil's grip, causes  chest  pain  and  cough.  Widespread  epidemics  of Bornholm's disease occur in the Paci{c islands and South Africa.
Kawasaki's  disease  occurs  in  children  under  5  years  of  age. This acute multi-system disease of unknown cause is characterized by  fever  of  5  days'  duration  and  four  of  {ve  clinical  features: non-purulent conjunctivitis; {ssured lips, strawberry tongue; cervical lymphadenopathy;  a  maculopapular  rash;  and  changes  in  the extremities  with  erythema  and  edema  of  the  hands  and  feet. Pneumonitis occurs in 10% of the children and coronary artery dilatation and aneurysms in 20% to 25% of untreated cases. In Brazil,  there  has  been  a  seasonal  rise  of  the  condition  at  the beginning and end of the monsoon season. 13
Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gatti are saprophytic fungi distributed worldwide and are particularly abundant in soil in the tropics  as  well  as  in  temperate  countries.  Pulmonary  infection results  from  inhalation  of  the  organisms  from  environmental sources . C. neoformans is the most common cause of meningoencephalitis in AIDS patients.

CHUNK 12
============================================================
EOSINOPHILIC PNEUMONIAS
Systemic  helminth  infection  usually  elicits  eosinophilia  and increased levels of IgE. Although eosinophilia can be a clue to a pulmonary helminth infestation, the de{nitive diagnosis requires demonstration of ova or larvae in sputum, bronchial alveolar lavage |uid, pleural |uid, or lung biopsy. 14 Loef|er's syndrome refers to 'simple'  pulmonary  eosinophilia  with  no  or  minimal  systemic and pulmonary symptoms. In many helminth infections (Ascaris, strongyloidiasis, hookworm), the larvae migrate through the lung and in heavy infections can cause fever, cough, dyspnea, wheezing, hemoptysis, and lung in{ltrate.
Schistosomes cause two clinical syndromes. In acute disease, immature schistosomula pass through the lung and can lead to fever, eosinophilia, and pulmonary in{ltrate. In chronic schistosomiasis, especially when portal hypertension has led to venous shunts, eggs can bypass the liver and plug pulmonary capillaries and arterioles, producing granuloma and pulmonary hypertension. Radiographs may show dilated pulmonary arteries and arteriovenous abnormalities (Fig. 1.5). 15
In paragonimiasis, the lung is the predominantly involved organ. The diagnosis must be considered in a patient from Southeast Asia with cough, hemoptysis (which is recurrent in > 80% of cases), a pulmonary cavity, and pleural effusion.
Tropical pulmonary eosinophilia, typically in India and other South Asian countries, is caused by immunologic hyperresponsiveness to Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, or other micro{lariae. Clinical presentation consists of nocturnal cough, wheezing, fever, and weight loss. Chest radiographs show diffuse interstitial miliary in{ltrates (Fig. 1.6); there is a high eosinophil count. In developed countries, serum IgE and anti-{larial antibodies can be used to con{rm the diagnosis.

CHUNK 13
============================================================
NON-COMMUNICABLE LUNG DISEASES
Non-communicable  diseases  (NCD) of  the  lung  refer  to  noninfectious chronic respiratory diseases, such as COPD, bronchial asthma, lung cancer, and bronchiectasis.
Fig. 1.5 Bilateral pulmonary artery dilatation in schistosomiasis.
Fig. 1.6 Bilateral interstitial opacities affecting all lung fields in a patient with tropical pulmonary eosinophilia.
NCDs now represent an increasing portion of global morbidity and mortality burden in low- and middle-income countries. This is  due  to  increased  tobacco  use  and  to  low  overall  health  and nutritional status, resulting in excess probability of mortality from NCD as  shown  in  Fig.  1.7.  In  2015  mortality  in  low-income countries accounted for 75% of overall global mortality. Most of the deaths occurred in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa where mortality  from  NCDs  and  injuries  often  exceeded  traditional infectious causes. 16,17
The incidence of asthma in the tropics is low for unclear reasons; however, 'all that wheezes is not asthma' is a dictum that is true in the tropics, as there are many entities that cause wheezing and dif{culty in breathing, including tropical eosinophilia and mitral

stenosis. Asthma  monitoring  in  the  tropics  can  be  achieved  by using an inexpensive peak |ow meter.

============================================================
CHUNK 14
============================================================
NON-COMMUNICABLE LUNG DISEASES
COPD is a progressive disease characterized by {xed airway obstruction. Causes of COPD in the tropics are increasing tobacco use and the widespread use of dung and biomass for indoor cooking and heating, demonstrated in one study in Indian males to decrease FEV1 by  70 mL  per  year. 18 The  most  common  symptoms  are dyspnea and chronic cough. The onset of dyspnea is insidious. With progression of airway obstruction, patients become short of breath at rest. When chest x-ray and pulmonary function testing are not available, a peak |ow meter is an inexpensive device to assess severity of airway obstruction and monitor the response to treatment.
Bronchiectasis is a chronic, debilitating condition. Dilatation and distortion of the airways lead to impaired mucociliary clearance, which encourages bacterial colonization and bronchial in|ammation. The diagnosis of bronchiectasis in developed  countries  is con{rmed by computed tomography of the chest (Fig. 1.8), whereas in the tropics, the diagnosis is mainly clinical and depends on a compatible history, presence of {nger clubbing, sputum that settles into three layers (mucoid or frothy, mucopurulent, and purulent), and a chest x-ray, if available.

============================================================
CHUNK 15
============================================================
PLEURAL EFFUSION
Pleural  effusion  is  frequent  and  has  variable  clinical  signs  and symptoms.  Large  effusions  are  associated  with  dyspnea  and diminished chest movements on the affected side.
If  possible,  all  but  the  smallest  effusions  should  be  tapped determining whether the |uid is serous, bloody, chylous, or contains pus. The  effusion  can  be  further  divided  into  transudative  and exudative, according to pleural |uid characterization. Laboratory tests that guide the management of a pleural effusion are macroscopic appearance, pleural |uid cell counts, biochemistry, pH, and Gram  stain.  A  simple  test  is  centrifugation  of  the  |uid.  If  an originally 'milky' |uid clears with that process, it is presumably an empyema. If not, it is either a chylothorax (pleural |uid triglycerides > 110 mg/dL) or a cholesterol  effusion  (pleural  |uid cholesterol > 200 mg/dL).
Fig. 1.8 Computed tomography of the chest: cylindrical and cystic bronchiectasis.
Transudative pleural effusions occur in heart failure, liver disease, endomyocardial {brosis, hypoproteinemia/malnutrition, and hypothyroidism. The pleural |uid white blood cell count is typically < 1000  cells/mm 3 ,  the  pH > 7.2,  protein < 3.0 g/L,  the  lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) < 200 IU/L, and the glucose ≥ 60 mg/dL. A bloody effusion is caused by hemothorax, trauma, malignancy, and pulmonary embolism.
Exudative  effusions  typically  have  cell  counts,  protein,  and biochemical markers opposite to those of transudates. Exudates can  be  further  classi{ed  into  neutrophilic,  lymphocytic,  and eosinophilic. A neutrophilic exudate occurs commonly in bacterial pneumonia cases and can progress to a complicated effusion or to an empyema, both necessitating pleural |uid drainage with a chest tube thoracostomy in addition to antibiotic treatment.

============================================================
CHUNK 16
============================================================
PLEURAL EFFUSION
The disease presenting with the highest pleural |uid lymphocytosis  is  tuberculous  pleuritis. A  large  volume  of  pleural  |uid should be obtained for examination for acid-fast bacilli. In about one-third of cases, the tuberculin skin test is negative initially and converts to positive after 2 to 4 weeks.
An eosinophilic exudate is more common in the tropics. Endemic parasitic and fungal infections are major causes of such an effusion. Ascariasis,  echinococcosis,  and  paragonimiasis  are  some  of  the parasitic infections. Paragonimiasis is associated with low pleural |uid  glucose  and  low  pH.  Fungal  diseases  responsible  for such an effusion are histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, and coccidioidomycosis.

============================================================
CHUNK 17
============================================================
NON-TUBERCULOUS GRANULOMATOUS LUNG DISEASE
In the absence of chest x-ray or biopsy evidence, it is not possible to diagnose pulmonary involvement due to sarcoidosis and other granulomatous diseases. Consequently, in the tropics, these disorders usually remain undiagnosed. The possibility of sarcoidosis should be considered in a patient with dyspnea, uveitis, hepatosplenomegaly, peripheral  lymphadenopathy,  chronic  skin  lesions,  and  a  chest x-ray {lm showing bilateral hilar adenopathy. 14

============================================================
CHUNK 18
============================================================
OCCUPATIONAL AND DUST LUNG DISEASES
The occupational disorders result from human social activity, and as  such  are  preventable.  The  dusts  that  provoke  occupational
disorders can be classi{ed into those that induce granulomatous reaction  (e.g.,  beryllium,  talc  and  organic  antigens);  those  that cause {brosis (e.g., silica, asbestos, and coal); and those that cause neither in|ammation nor {brosis, thus remaining inert (e.g., iron, barium, and tin). Poorly recognized occupational diseases in the tropics  are  byssinosis  (due  to  cotton  dust),  mostly  in  Asia  and Africa; bagassosis (due to sugar cane), mostly in Americas, Cuba, and India; and hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
Podoconiosis is an endemic non-{larial elephantiasis occurring in individuals exposed to red clay soil derived from alkaline rock. The silica particles are found in the skin, lymph nodes, and lymphatics of affected and unaffected individuals. These individuals have reduced lung function compared with adults living in areas of low silica concentration. 19
