INTRODUCTION
Between 25,000 and 40,000 children are adopted each year by citizens from a country other than the child's country of birth [1]. Underlying reasons for loss of parents remain constant and include extreme poverty, death of one or both parents, abandonment due to gender or  disability,  armed  conflict  resulting  in  separation  from  parents, maternal substance abuse, or other social or cultural determinants. The HIV epidemic has led to an increase in the number of orphaned children,  particularly  on  the  African  continent.  One  hundred  and forty-three million children are estimated to have been orphaned by one or both parents [2].
The demography of international adoption is in constant flux. Consequently, the epidemiology of diseases in this population of children shifts from year to year. For example, in 1990, United States citizens adopted children predominantly from South Korea (38%), Colombia (9%), the Philippines (6%) and Peru (6%). In 2009, China (24%), Ethiopia (18%), Russia (12%), South Korea (8.5%) and Guatemala (6%) were the predominant countries of birth [3]. Individual health risks  vary  depending  on  intrauterine  exposure  to  infections  and toxins, genetic heritage, congenital anomalies, caregiver environment (foster care versus institutional care), food security, exposure to infection,  circumstances  leading  to  the  loss  of  parental  care,  and  birth region.
Common medical problems for international adoptees (IA) include chronic malnutrition, anemia, latent tuberculosis infection, and intestinal  parasites.  Approximately  50%  of  IA  will  experience  an  acute infection within the first month following arrival in the US. Most can be  successfully  treated  as  outpatients.  Upper  respiratory  infections and diarrhea are common. Skin conditions such as scabies, impetigo, and molluscum contagiosum are relatively common. Evaluation of the  sick  IA  depends  on  both  the  epidemiology  of  diseases  in  the country of origin and on the medical and social history of the child.

Birth family history and immunization records may be unavailable or unreliable.
Growth failure is the most common medical problem children have on  arrival.  Psychosocial  deprivation,  particularly  long-term  institutionalization,  adversely  affects  growth  in  height,  weight  and  head circumference [4]. Children may arrive with a low weight-for-height secondary to lack of protein and calories. In a study of 869 children adopted between 1986 and 2001 from 33 different countries, 28% were chronically malnourished, and 5% were acutely malnourished [5]. In Miller's study of 452 IA from China, z-scores of ≤-2 were found for 39% of children for height, 24% for head circumference and 18% for  weight.  Although  some  children  arrive  from  Ethiopia  with  a history  of  severe  protein-energy  malnutrition,  they  appear  to  be growing better than their peers who arrive from long-term orphanage care [6]. Micronutrient deficiencies including zinc, vitamin D and iron deficiency have been documented in children from all countries.
Lead  toxicity  is  well  documented,  particularly  among  children adopted from Asia, with children from China at highest risk. In one study, 13% of children from China had elevated lead levels ranging from 1 1.1 to 51 μ g/dL [7].
Internationally adopted children come from countries with a high or intermediate prevalence of tuberculosis, hepatitis A, and hepatitis B. They are routinely screened for hepatitis B, tuberculosis, and HIV in their  birth  countries.  However,  the  reliability  of  the  pre-adoption screens varies from country to country. In one study, 50% of newly arrived  children  had  an  undiagnosed  medical  condition.  Of  these, more than 50% were diagnosed with an infectious disease [8].

============================================================
CHUNK 3
============================================================
TUBERCULOSIS
Tuberculosis is one of the most serious medical diagnoses identified among IA. In one study of 527 IA, 21% had a positive tuberculin skin test (TST) on arrival. Of those who were negative initially, 46.9% were retested at 3 months or more after arrival, and 20% of these initially negative skin tests had converted to positive. No active cases of tuberculosis were found in this group [9]. Possible explanations for conversion  include  exposure  immediately  prior  to  departure  from  birth country, and improvement in nutritional status with boosting of the skin test. Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA), which can distinguish BCG immunity from tuberculosis infection, are being studied in children. QuantiFERON GOLD is currently recommended as an alternative method of diagnosing infection in children ≥ 5 years old.
In a study of 869 IA from 33 different countries between 1986 and 2001, 12% had evidence of M. tuberculosis infection (TST ≥ 10 mm) on initial screening and no active disease. The frequency of positive TST screens did not depend on birth region or nutritional status [5]. The continent of  Africa  was not represented in that  study.  International adoption in significant numbers of children from African countries, particularly Ethiopia, began in 2004. A 2008 study reported a positive TST for 16% of 54 Ethiopian children [6].
Screening for tuberculosis should be done for all children older than 3  months  of  age.  TSTs  may  be  negative  in  young  infants,  if  their

TUBERCULOSIS
exposure to tuberculosis was recent, they are malnourished or otherwise  immunocompromised,  or  they  recently  received  a  live-virus vaccine. The TST should take place within 2 weeks of arrival and be repeated  within  3  to  6  months  for  those  children  who  had  a  TST < 10 mm on arrival [5,9]. The TST should be placed regardless of BCG vaccination status. QuantiFERON GOLD may be substituted for the TST in children 5 years of age or older. A physical examination and chest radiograph to assess for extrapulmonary and pulmonary tuberculosis are indicated for every child with a positive TST. A child with a positive TST but no evidence of active disease should be treated with isoniazid for latent tuberculosis infection. If positive for active disease, every effort should be made to isolate the organism, particularly if the child is from a region  of  the  world  with  a  high  rate  of  multidrugresistant TB, such as Eastern Europe, Russia, Asia, or certain countries in Africa, e.g., South Africa.
Children ≥ 2  years  old  arriving  from  countries  highly  endemic  for tuberculosis are required to be evaluated for TB prior to entering the US [10]. However, following natural disasters such as the January 2010 earthquake in Haiti, orphans may not have received routine screening prior to arrival in the adoptive country.

============================================================

============================================================
HEPATITIS A
Infants  and  young  children  from  hepatitis  A  (HAV)-endemic  areas may be acutely infected, asymptomatic and shedding virus with the potential  to  infect  nonimmune  adoptive  families  and  others  with whom they may come in contact (e.g. day care). Serology has proven useful in identifying these children. In 2009, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended that people anticipating close contact with an IA within 60 days after arrival from a country known for intermediate or high rates of hepatitis A should be vaccinated against hepatitis A [1 1]. Among IA < 6 years of age, the prevalence of total HAV antibody ranges from 10% (among Chinese children) to 55-72% (of Ethiopian children) [12].

============================================================
CHUNK 6
============================================================
HEPATITIS B
Hepatitis B (HBV) infection in the IA can be silent or acutely symptomatic. The prevalence of hepatitis B among IA ranges from 1% to 5%. In a study of 1282 IA between 1999 and 2006, 1.1% were identified with acute or chronic infection. An additional 2.9% had evidence of  resolved  infection.  The  highest  rates  were  among  children  from Ethiopia and Bulgaria [13]. Children found to be hepatitis B surface antigen  (HBsAg)-positive  must  be  tested  again.  Persistence  of  the surface antigen for 6 months or more indicates chronic hepatitis B infection. Children who initially test negative for hepatitis B surface antibody and antigen must be retested within 6 months. All members of  the  household adopting a  child who is  HBV-infected should be immunized and should have post-immunization antibody titers to determine whether levels are consistent with protection.

============================================================
CHUNK 7
============================================================
HEPATITIS C
Hepatitis C (HCV) seroprevalence among IA is less than 1%. Routine screening is not recommended. The AAP recommends consideration of  HCV  screening  for  children  from  Russia,  Eastern  Europe,  and China.  Screening  of  children  from  other  regions  may  be  indicated depending on the prevalence of HCV in the country of origin, history of blood transfusions, and maternal drug history [14].

============================================================
CHUNK 8
============================================================
SYPHILIS
Screening for Treponema pallidum is  recommended. Though uncommon among IA, a prevalence of 1.7% or less has been reported [15]. If prior sexual abuse is suspected, a syphilis screen should be repeated 1 month after arrival. Children from tropical regions may have positive tests due to spirochete infections other than syphilis, but differentiation  between  syphilis  and  other  treponeme  infections  (yaws, pinta, and bejel) may be impossible unless active lesions are present. Care must be taken in the interpretation of either the treponemal or nontreponemal test result. If syphilis cannot be excluded satisfactorily, a full evaluation for disease must be undertaken and appropriate treatment given.

============================================================
CHUNK 9
============================================================
HIV
Despite the increasing number of children orphaned due to HIV, the prevalence  of  HIV  infection  among  IA  has  been  low  in  multiple studies  [15].  In  the  future,  increasing  numbers  of  IA  will  likely  be HIV-positive as adoptive parents more favorably consider adopting children who have the infection. All children should be screened on arrival for HIV antibodies. If they are less than 6 months of age they also should have HIV DNA PCR done. Some experts recommend a follow-up antibody screen 6 months post arrival to detect infection that  may  have  occurred  immediately  prior  to  departure  from  the country of origin.

============================================================
CHUNK 10
============================================================
INTESTINAL PATHOGENS
Diarrhea  and  abdominal  distention  are  common  among  newly arrived children. In one study, > 25% of IA had one or more intestinal parasites  [16].  Other  common  stool  pathogens  include Blastocystis hominis,  Dientamoeba  fragilis ,  and Hymenolepis  nana .  Stool  samples should be cultured for enteric bacteria in any child with diarrhea.
Helicobacter pylori must be considered in the evaluation of abdominal pain, anemia, or growth failure. Risk factors include orphanage residence (versus foster care), older age at adoption, and intestinal parasite infection.  Stool for H. pylori antigen  is a  noninvasive screening method [17].
Screening for malaria parasites should be considered for all IA coming from areas where malaria is holoendemic (Haiti or most countries in sub-Saharan Africa). In a small study of Liberian immigrant children in Minnesota, 28 of 43 (65%) were positive for a Plasmodium species, but one-third were asymptomatic and one-third had splenomegaly as the only sign of infection [18].

============================================================
CHUNK 11
============================================================
EOSINOPHILIA
An  absolute  eosinophil  count  greater  than  450  requires  etiologic investigation. This should include stool for ova and parasites, although this test alone is insufficient if the eosinophilia is persistent or high. Serologic tests for Strongyloides stercoralis , Schistosomia spp., lymphatic filariasis, Toxocara canis , echinococcosis, Entamoeba histolytica , and visceral or cutaneous larval migrans are indicated as guided by history, physical examination and country of birth. Patients with eosinophilia often are asymptomatic. Empiric treatment with albendazole or ivermectin  is  recommended  for  the  patient  who  has  persistent  eosinophilia without a cause [18].

============================================================
CHUNK 12
============================================================
IMMUNIZATIONS
More than 90% of IA need catch-up immunizations to meet standards in the US. Availability and reliability of pre-adoption immunization records  are  variable.  Practitioners  can  choose  from  two  clinically sound  approaches:  (a)  either  screening  for  quantitative  antibody levels to verify immunity in the infant > 6 months of age based on vaccine record and/or knowledge of immunizations available in the birth country; or  (b)  immunization  according  to  age and catch-up schedule [19]. Typically measles vaccine as a single antigen is administered in most birth countries rather than full MMR. MMR is recommended over serologic testing for measles antibody. Varicella testing for  children  coming  from  tropical  countries  is  not  recommended prior  to  12  years  of  age  unless  there  is  a  history  of  disease.  In  the tropics, varicella is a disease of adolescents and adults.

BOX 150.1  De7nition of a Positive Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) in Internationally Adopted Children
Children  with  previously  unidentified  chronic  medical  conditions may appear healthy. Therefore, specialized laboratory screening and examination by a professional skilled in caring for this population are needed to identify and treat potential long-term issues. IA are at risk for developmental delays, fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, and failure to thrive. Orphans are at increased risk for neglect of physical and social needs and physical abuse, placing them at increased risk for  mental  illness.  In  addition,  congenital  anomalies  and  genetic disorders must be considered on examination. The initial examination is recommended within 2 weeks of arrival, or sooner if the child is acutely ill with fever or diarrhea. A thorough history and physical examination should be performed with particular attention to specific details (Table 150-1 & Box 150.1).
A detailed developmental examination that includes sensory evaluation by an occupational therapist is necessary. Consultation with a child  psychologist  experienced  in  international  adoption  issues  is recommended if there is a history of multiple transitions, physical signs of fetal alcohol syndrome, long-term institutional care, known mental health issues, acute attachment issues, birth parent depression, physical or sexual abuse, or if the child is older than 4 years at the time of adoption (Table 150-2).
