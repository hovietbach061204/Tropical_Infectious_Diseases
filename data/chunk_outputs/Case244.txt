COMMON SYNDROMES OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE IN THE TROPICS
The principal syndromes of acquired cardiovascular disease are heart failure, stroke, and vascular disorders (T ables 2.1-2.3).

Heart Failure
Heart failure is a syndrome of effort intolerance secondary to a cardiac abnormality in which altered adaptation leads to salt and water retention. Heart failure is the dominant form of cardiovascular disease  in  many  tropical  and  sub-tropical  regions  where  the epidemiology differs from that in industrialized countries. 1 First, heart failure in the tropics is due largely to non-ischemic causes. Second, the common causes of heart failure (see T able 2.1) usually present in children and young adults before middle age. Third, infections remain predominant etiologies. Rheumatic heart disease contributes  1.2  million  cases  of  mild  to  severe  heart  failure, particularly  in  Oceania,  South  Asia,  and  sub-Saharan  Africa. 2 together with tuberculous pericarditis, accounts for at least 10% of cases of heart failure.

Cardiovascular Diseases
Bongani M. Mayosi † , Blanche Cupido, John Lawrenson and cardiomyopathy has increased in regions where HIV/AIDS has reached epidemic proportions. Chagasic heart disease due to Trypanosoma cruzi infection exacts a heavy toll on people living in Latin America. 3
In contrast to industrialized nations, where degenerative valvular heart disease predominates, valvular disease in the tropics is almost always the result of infection, is encountered in the young, and may have a rapid course. Valvular disease in developed nations is  an  insidious  disease  of  the  elderly,  who  frequently  have co-morbidities.
The epidemiology of  non-rheumatic  valvular  disease  in  the tropics is poorly de{ned. Myxomatous mitral valve disease associated with mitral valve prolapse is an uncommon indication for mitral valve surgery compared with rheumatic valve disease. Congenital sub-valvular aneurysms below the mitral and aortic valves are rare forms of valvular heart disease that were {rst described in Africa. These congenital aneurysms can be associated with varying degrees of  valve  regurgitation,  can  rupture  or  compress  the  coronary arteries, or can predispose to infective endocarditis or thrombus with systemic embolization.
The major clinical aspects of infective endocarditis in the tropics are  similar  to  the  experience  in  industrialized  countries  before the antibiotic era. Infective endocarditis is a disease of the young with high morbidity and mortality, and underlying rheumatic heart disease is the major predisposing factor. 4

============================================================
Stroke
The World Health Organization (WHO) de{nes stroke as rapidly developing clinical signs of focal (or global) disturbance of cerebral function, with symptoms lasting 24 hours or longer or leading to death,  with  no  apparent  cause  other  than  vascular  origin.  The age-standardized mortality, case fatality, and prevalence of disabling stroke in the tropics are similar to or higher than those measured in most industrialized countries. In the tropics, stroke incidence is higher in people less than 65 years of age, and there is a greater proportion of hemorrhagic (30% vs. 15%) compared with ischemic stroke than in industrialized countries. In the tropics, more than 90% of patients with hemorrhagic stroke and more than half with ischemic stroke are hypertensive. Although hypertension is the single  most  important  risk  factor  for  stroke,  non-hypertensive causes explain nearly half of cases of ischemic stroke. These factors include structural heart disease, cardiac arrhythmia, HIV/AIDS, and other infections (see T able 2.2). 5
In tropical countries, treatable infections account for the majority of causes, with extra-cranial and intra-cranial vasculopathy contributing to 20% of cases. 6 Infection with HIV is associated with an increased risk of stroke, occurs in younger patients, and is due to ischemia in the majority of cases.

============================================================
Vascular Disorders
Arterial  and  venous  syndromes  include  diseases  of  the  aorta, atherosclerosis  of  medium-sized  arteries,  and  unusual  vascular disorders of the tropics (see T able 2.3).
Atheroma and dissection of the aorta are present in communities with  an  accumulation  of  risk  factors,  including  hypertension. Similarly,  atheroma  and  aortic  aneurysm  are  more  common  as cardiovascular risk pro{le worsens. By contrast, aortitis resulting from syphilis is less common due to the early use of penicillin.

Idiopathic tropical aortitis, or T akayasu's disease, is found in subSaharan Africa and Asia. The clinical manifestations depend on the stage and anatomy of the disease. The disease may present with  angina,  cerebral  ischemic  symptoms,  absent  pulses,  and hypertension-a common presentation in children. 7
Atherosclerosis of medium-sized vessels presents with cardiac pain  and  coronary  thrombosis,  intermittent  claudication  and gangrene  of  the  legs,  and  mesenteric  artery  occlusion.  These ischemic syndromes are common in people of Asian, Melanesian, mellitus). Angina in the tropical environment may also be due to valvular heart disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dysrhythmias, syphilitic arteritis, or anemia.

============================================================
CHUNK 6
============================================================
Vascular Disorders
Hemoglobin disorders (such as sickle cell disease) contribute to cardiovascular disease by exacerbating existing cardiac disease with anemia or by causing peripheral vascular occlusion or pulmonary hypertension.
Idiopathic  gangrene  of  the  extremities,  gangrene  associated with  tropical  phlebitis,  and  gangrene  associated  with  acquired hemolytic anemia are unusual in Africa. Idiopathic gangrene of the extremities presents mainly in infants and children as bilateral symmetric gangrene. No cause is found, although infection with Salmonella typhi, S. paratyphi, and Neisseria meningitidis has been The onset of illness is  acute,  with fever, malaise, and  petechial rash associated with symmetric gangrene affecting the digits.
Gangrene of  the limbs,  associated  with  tropical  phlebitis,  is thought to be part of the same spectrum of disease as the peripheral gangrene syndrome. The veins are in|amed and later thrombosed and occluded. An adjoining artery may be affected. The cavernous sinus, internal jugular vein, or limb veins can be affected. 8

An Approach to the Patient With Cardiovascular Disease
Despite variable access to resources for investigation and treatment, the practitioner in a developing country can achieve a great deal with a thorough history and physical examination. The social and geographic context of the consultation should never be taken for granted.
The key syndromes of cardiovascular disease are recognized on clinical examination. Congestive heart failure is characterized by pedal edema, raised jugular venous pressure, and tender hepatomegaly,  whereas  stroke  is  recognized  by  the  presence  of  a neurologic de{cit that is consistent with a vascular insult. Vascular disorders present with several clinical syndromes (see T able 2.3), depending on the type and location of the diseased vessel. Features of immunosuppression should be sought in patients with suspected HIV infection.
Essential tests in the evaluation include urine for protein, blood and glucose, electrocardiography (ECG), chest radiography, and HIV serology. A full blood count and urea, creatinine, sodium, and potassium levels are useful in excluding anemia, renal disease, and electrolyte abnormalities. In the evaluation of heart failure, echocardiography is required to de{ne the nature of the cardiac abnormality.  In  stroke,  the  erythrocyte  sedimentation  rate  or C-reactive protein, syphilis serology, and a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the brain are indicated. Other tests, such as carotid Doppler  ultrasound,  echocardiography,  clotting  screen,  blood cultures,  lumbar  puncture,  and  thrombophilia  screen,  may  be conducted depending on the clinical presentation and available facilities. In vascular disease of the aorta and medium-sized vessels, angiography is essential for the delineation of the disease. Speci{c diagnostic tests, such as blood culture for infective endocarditis, may be necessary.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is playing an increasing role  in  the  evaluation  of patients with cardiovascular disorders, but it is not widely available in tropical countries.

============================================================
CHUNK 8
============================================================
Heart Failure
The differential diagnosis of heart failure is listed in T able 2.1. The diagnosis of cardiomyopathy is clinically made by excluding other  causes  of  heart  failure  such  as  hypertension  and  valvular and severe systolic dysfunction may present initially with blood pressure in the normal range, with hypertension declaring itself after a period of treatment; their presenting blood pressure is low because of markedly reduced cardiac output. It may be dif{cult to distinguish hypertensive heart failure from idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, because the latter is accompanied by blood pressure readings  in  the  hypertensive  range  in  up  to  8%  of  cases. This dif{culty is compounded because the end-organ effects of hypertension, such as renal involvement and aortic dilatation, may not be apparent.
It is essential to exclude reversible forms of nutritional heart muscle disease such as beriberi (thiamine de{ciency). Beriberi should be considered when heart failure occurs in an alcoholic or in an impoverished person or child living in an area where polished rice forms the major part of the diet. In beriberi, neurologic symptoms such as paresthesia, weakness of peripheral nerves, and Wernicke's encephalopathy are occasionally present. The de{nitive diagnosis is  made by demonstrating diminished erythrocyte transketolase activity, which increases after the addition of thiamine pyrophosphate. When this testing is not available, a short course of thiamine supplementation may be bene{cial. A rapid response to therapy, with a decrease in cardiac size clinically and on x-ray within 2 weeks, will occur in the patient who is thiamine de{cient.
The forms of cardiomyopathy that are unique to people living in  tropical  environments  include  peripartum  cardiomyopathy, -diomyopathy is con{rmed by echocardiographic demonstration of  left  ventricular  systolic  dysfunction  that  is  not  explained  by other forms of heart disease. The typical period of disease onset is  in  the  last  month  of  pregnancy  and  up  to  5  months  after delivery.

Heart Failure
Tropical endomyocardial {brosis (Fig. 2.1) affects children in very  low  socioeconomic groups in  countries  within  15  degrees latitude from the equator. Symptoms are typically suggestive of congestive cardiomyopathy, but signs resemble constrictive pericarditis. As with congestive cardiomyopathy, patients present with  dyspnea,  orthopnea,  and  peripheral  edema.  And,  as  with constrictive pericarditis, pulsus paradoxus, a raised jugular venous pressure  with  rapid  'x'  and  'y'  descents,  an  early  third  heart sound, hepatomegaly, and ascites are present. Unlike constrictive pericarditis, however, there is frequently a murmur of tricuspid and/or mitral regurgitation.
The diagnosis of endomyocardial {brosis is made on the basis of clinical, echocardiographic, and hemodynamic changes. Echocardiography shows increased ventricular wall thickness and cavity obliteration, often with an echo-bright endocardium, and enlarged atria,  with  or  without a small  pericardial  effusion. On  Doppler assessment, a restrictive {lling pattern and reduced tissue Doppler signal may be noted. Cardiac catheterization con{rms the combination of restricted {lling and incompetence of the atrioventricular valves,  as  well  as  showing  excess  {brous  tissue  in  endocardial biopsy specimens. 9

Heart Failure
Chagas  disease  from T.  cruzi is  acquired  only  in  South  and Central America; however, patients may migrate to high-income regions  where  they  can  present. At  least  20%  will  progress  to chronic  Chagas  cardiomyopathy,  characterized  by  angina  and symptomatic conduction system disease. 10 In advanced cases there is severe, protracted, congestive cardiac failure, often predominantly right-sided.  Bi-fascicular  block  is  present  in  more  than  80% of  cases,  and  death  from  asystole  and  arrhythmia  is  common. Autonomic dysfunction is also common. Apical aneurysms  and left ventricular dilatation increase the risk of thromboembolism and  arrhythmias.  The  chest  x-ray  demonstrates  cardiomegaly. The  ECG  is  abnormal  late  in  the  disease.  Echocardiographic features in advanced cases are those of dilated cardiomyopathy, including  left  ventricular  posterior  wall  hypokinesia  and  preserved  interventricular  septum  motion,  as  well  as  an  apical aneurysm.
Acute Chagas disease is diagnosed by demonstrating trypanosomes in the peripheral blood or amastigotes in a lymph node biopsy. In chronic disease, serology is usually positive; polymerase

Heart Failure
In tuberculous pericardial effusion, evidence of chronic cardiac compression mimicking heart failure is the most common presentation in parts of southern Africa. In this region, heart failure due to tuberculous pericarditis is less common than rheumatic heart disease, but more common than hypertensive heart disease and cardiomyopathy. Although there is marked overlap between the physical signs of pericardial effusion and constrictive pericarditis, the presence of increased cardiac dullness extending to the right of the sternum favors a clinical diagnosis of pericardial effusion. It is easy to detect a pericardial effusion using echocardiography (Fig. 2.2A). Unfortunately, ultrasound does not establish an etiologic diagnosis. Is it also not always possible to diagnose constrictive pericarditis.
Imaging by CT scanning or MRI to diagnose constriction (Fig. 2.2B-D) can be used, but is seldom  available  in  tropical  areas. Signs and symptoms of tuberculous pericarditis are usually nonspeci{c and vague. Demonstration of tubercle bacilli in pericardial |uid or on histology of the pericardium establishes a de{nitive diagnosis of tuberculous pericarditis. Recent advances in diagnosis 11 -able' tuberculous pericarditis is based  on  proof of  tuberculosis elsewhere in a patient with otherwise unexplained pericarditis, a lymphocytic pericardial exudate with elevated adenosine deaminase levels, and/or an appropriate response to a trial of anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy. 12

Stroke
The differential  diagnosis  of  stroke  in  the  tropics  is  similar  to other parts of the world (see T able 2.2). Evaluation by CT scan or MRI (which may be available only in tertiary referral hospitals) will establish whether the person has infarction or hemorrhage and  excludes  other  conditions  that  may  mimic  stroke,  such  as sub-arachnoid hemorrhage and brain tumor. A chest x-ray may reveal  a  primary  source  of  malignancy.  An  echocardiogram  is indicated if a cardiac source of embolism is suspected. In primary intra-cerebral hemorrhage, a clotting screen should be performed, and a thrombophilia screen in young patients with unexplained stroke. Lumbar puncture is indicated in suspected sub-arachnoid hemorrhage or meningitis, as well as in those patients with an ischemic stroke who are HIV positive.

The clinical diagnosis of large and medium-sized arterial disease should be con{rmed using angiography. In atherosclerotic disease of the aorta and medium-sized arteries, the etiology is related to cardiovascular  risk  factors,  which  require  speci{c  testing  and implementation  of  control  measures.  In  aortitis,  the  etiologic diagnosis is syphilis or idiopathic aortitis. A biopsy of the artery may be necessary.

============================================================
CHUNK 14
============================================================
Management and Outcomes
Management principles of heart failure, stroke, and vascular disease are the same in the tropics as elsewhere in the world. However, empiric treatment may be needed in certain instances before a de{nitive diagnosis is reached. For example, in patients presenting with a large pericardial effusion from a community where tuberculosis  is  endemic,  it  is  appropriate  to  start  anti-tuberculosis treatment if pericardiocentesis is not possible or before microbiology results become available. Adjunctive corticosteroids  reduce the incidence of constrictive pericarditis, although they may be associated with an  increase in HIV-associated complications in patients not on antiretroviral treatment. 13
In  patients  with  valvular  disease  and  heart  failure  due  to rheumatic heart disease (Fig. 2.3), ongoing penicillin prophylaxis (past the age of 35 years, sometimes even lifelong) is recommended even if surgery is not undertaken. 14
There are few studies comparing the outcome of patients with heart failure and vascular disorders in the tropics versus non-tropical regions. By  contrast, a systematic analysis of stroke studies has shown that the case fatality in hospital-based prospective studies is  about 30% at 1  month-a value much higher than the 20% reported  for  older  populations  in  the  rest  of  the  world.  The prevalence of disability from  stroke  in sub-Saharan Africa is  at least as high as in high-income areas.

PEDIATRIC CONSIDERATION: CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE
Congenital heart disease refers to malformations of heart structure existing at birth according to the WHO. It is the most common congenital abnormality occurring in isolation or in combination with other genetic abnormalities. Survival into adulthood is the norm for more than 90% of patients born with congenital heart disease  in  industrialized  nations;  however,  surgical  correction of  defects  is  rare  in  developing  nations.  In  these  countries, initiating  and  sustaining  surgical  programs  must  be  balanced against the need to control infectious disease and diseases related to poverty.

============================================================
CHUNK 16
============================================================
Clinical Presentation
The cause of a congenital heart lesion in most cases is unknown. Exposure to teratogens and genetic syndromes account for a relatively small proportion of the total number of defects. An approach to classi{cation is shown in Fig. 2.4.
Approximately 40% of all patients born with congenital heart disease will need surgery in the {rst years of life to survive. The
Fig. 2.3
introduction  of  a  surgical  program  needs  to  be  balanced  with major improvements in the under-5-year mortality in a country-a level  of  less  than  30  deaths/1000  live  births  appears  to  be  the threshold value. Few developing countries have surgical programs that meet or partly meet the needs of the population.
The attrition of complex patients in early life therefore will mean  that  the  practitioner  is  likely  to  encounter  adults  with moderate left-to-right shunts, uncomplicated valvular heart disease, and obstructive pulmonary vascular disease. In areas with a high prevalence of rheumatic heart disease, congenital heart disease is likely to be confused with valvular heart disease.
A heart lesion should be suspected in any patient with a recognizable genetic abnormality. The practitioner caring for the patient with Down's syndrome or Marfan syndrome should be aware that cardiac disease is an integral part of the disorder.
Adults with congenital heart disease typically have atrial septal defect, small ventricular septal defects, and mild to moderate aortic and pulmonary stenosis. The majority of patients seen are symptomatic, with dyspnea and palpitations the most common presenting complaints. 15 T able  2.4  compares  the  physical  signs,  ECG,  and chest x-ray {ndings in patients presenting in adulthood with the more common congenital heart lesions. The {nal diagnosis will be con{rmed by echocardiography; fortunately, the cost of highquality echocardiographic machines has declined with time.
In patients with underlying congenital heart disease, co-morbid conditions  can  be  common  in  tropical  climates.  For  example, sickle  cell  disease  is  associated  with  high  risk  of  pulmonary hypertension.

============================================================
CHUNK 17
============================================================
Clinical Presentation
Diuretics and digoxin are used to obtain symptomatic relief in  patients  with  large  left-to-right  shunts. This  practice  is  not based on evidence from controlled trials, but is an extension from the  practice  in  patients  with  heart  failure.  The  resolution  of symptoms, however, will only  be  achieved with  surgical  repair. Many countries rely on charity for surgical access; well-organized humanitarian  missions  (such  as  those  offered  by  the  Chain  of Hope organization) can improve individual health and are more effective  than moving patients to high-income countries. Some countries, such as Guatemala, have growing programs that aim to serve as training hubs for a region. Other countries, such as Brazil, have well-established programs offering high-quality and innovative surgery.
When  surgery  can  be  offered  only  to  limited  numbers  of individuals, practitioners should select patients with straightforward conditions that need limited long-term care.
