INTRODUCTION
Globally,  blindness  remains  one  of  the  main  causes  of  disability affecting humans. More than 161 million people are blind or visionimpaired due to eye diseases such as cataract, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, trachoma and macular degeneration (Fig. 9.1) [1]. An extra 153 million people are vision-impaired from uncorrected refractive error (Table 9-1) [2].
Many of the ocular conditions affecting people in tropical countries are  preventable  or  treatable  (see  'Key  features'  box).  Trained  field workers are crucial for the control of blinding infections, malnutrition and  filariasis;  for  primary  care  of  simple  ocular  trauma  and  acute glaucoma;  and  for  the  recognition  and  referral  of  cases  of  chronic glaucoma, cataract and the more complicated diseases  that  require surgery.
The  most  important steps  in  assessing  a  patient's  problem  involve taking  a  careful  and  appropriate  history  and  performing  a  proper examination. It is important to elicit a history of the onset, duration and characteristics of the presenting complaint, together with a review of  the  patient's  general  health  and  individual  and  family  history. Specific information concerning vision - such as blurring, flashes or floaters, double vision, visual field loss and night blindness - should

be sought, and questions about ocular discharge, pain and discomfort should be asked.
A basic part of the ophthalmic examination is the assessment of visual acuity, which is traditionally measured with a letter test chart, placed 6 meters away from the patient. The acuity of small children can be assessed  by  determining  their  ability  to  fixate  upon  and  follow  a target, such as a light, evaluating one eye at a time while the other eye is covered. Children will also often object to covering of the normal eye but not a poorly seeing eye. Picture charts are sometimes used for pre-literate children. An E chart is also used for illiterate adults, where the direction of the 'tumbling E' of diminishing sizes is identified.
Simple  observation  of  the  eye  will  often  give  much  information, especially in terms of the presence and site of infection or trauma (Fig. 9.2 - demonstrates ocular anatomy), the alignment and movement of  the eyes,  or their  possible displacement.  Careful  examination of the  front  of  the  eye  with  a  hand  light  will  reveal  gross  corneal  or conjunctival  disease,  including  xerophthalmia,  trachoma,  foreign bodies  and  corneal  ulcers.  It  also  reveals  much  about  the  anterior chamber  and  lens,  the  presence  of  blood  or  pus  in  the  eye,  acute glaucoma and significant lens opacities (cataract). Whenever possible, the front of the eye should be examined with some magnification, e.g. 2.5 × magnification loupe, or a direct ophthalmoscope using a + 10 diopter lens.
The diagnosis of mild trachoma requires examination of the conjunctiva on the undersurface of the upper lid, which is accomplished by everting the eyelid (Fig. 9.3). The pupils can also be examined with a hand light, taking note of their size, shape and response to light. It is usually easier to examine the pupils in a somewhat darkened room. A direct ophthalmoscope is essential for examining the back of the interior  eye,  to  search  for  abnormalities  of  the  optic  disc,  macular region, blood vessels and other areas.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF THE PAINFUL, RED EYE - KEY SYNDROMES
The painful, red eye is one of the most common ocular problems. Many such patients have conjunctivitis, but all should be examined carefully, because a number of serious eye conditions can present with a similar picture.  In almost every case, the correct diagnosis can be made from the history and a simple ocular examination (Fig. 9.4).
The most important conditions that present as a painful, red eye are conjunctivitis, keratitis (including keratoconjunctivitis), corneal trauma and foreign bodies, anterior uveitis and acute angle-closure glaucoma (Table 9-2).

============================================================
CONJUNCTIVITIS
Conjunctivitis is the most common cause of red eye bilaterally. It is usually infective, although conjunctivitis may be allergic or traumatic. It is commonly bilateral; a unilateral red eye increases the likelihood of  other  diagnoses.  Infectious  conjunctivitis  usually  has  an  acute onset, which is accompanied by ocular discharge. In viral and chlamydial  conjunctivitis,  the  discharge  is  usually  thin  and  watery.  With bacterial conjunctivitis or secondary bacterial infection, the discharge

is  mucopurulent or purulent. A frankly purulent discharge is especially common in gonococcal infections. Mucopurulent and purulent discharges frequently accumulate on the eyelashes and lid margins, causing the lids to stick together.
The most consistent sign of conjunctivitis is conjunctival injection. The superficial and tortuous vessels of the conjunctiva appear dilated and bright red or pink, giving rise to the common term 'pink eye' . In severe inflammation, pseudomembranes, or even true membranes, may  be  present.  These  are  seen  as  dirty  gray  sloughs  on  the  tarsal conjunctiva. In viral and chlamydial conjunctivitis, follicles are frequently present. Giant, fleshy papillae may occur in allergic conjunctivitis. A detailed description of trachoma and inclusion conjunctivitis is provided in Chapter 35.

============================================================
CHUNK 5
============================================================
CONJUNCTIVITIS
Visual acuity is  usually not affected in conjunctivitis. The cornea is clear and bright; the pupil is  circular  and  reacts normally;  and the anterior chamber is clear and of normal depth.
Bacterial conjunctivitis usually requires specific antibiotic treatment. Antibiotics such as chloramphenicol may be given topically as 0.5%
drops (four times per day) and as 1.0% ointment at night. Alternatively, and especially in children, antibiotic ointment, such as 1.0% tetracycline (four times per day) may be used for 1 week. Other ophthalmic solutions may also be used, such as those containing fluoroquinolone antibiotics, although expense may be prohibitive in many regions of the world. Patients should be cautioned to keep their eyes clean  by  washing  away  accumulated  discharge.  They  should  wash their hands carefully and not share towels or clothes with others, to avoid spreading infection.
Neonatal  gonococcal  conjunctivitis  is  a  medical  emergency.  The infant should be hospitalized to confirm response to therapy and a single dose of either ceftriaxone 25-50 mg/kg (not to exceed 125 mg) or  cefotaxime  50 mg/kg  should  be  administered  intravenously  or intramuscularly. The neonate should also receive treatment for presumptive  chlamydial  conjunctivitis  with  a  1-3-day  course  of  oral azithromycin 20 mg/kg/day to maximal dose of 1 g or erythromycin syrup (50 mg/kg/day divided into four doses per day for 14 days). Saline irrigation of the eyes should be performed immediately and then  at  hourly  intervals  for  as  long  as  necessary  to  eliminate  the purulent discharge [3].
Chlamydial conjunctivitis and trachoma in adults and non-neonatal children  should  be  treated  with  systemic  azithromycin  with  a  1 g single oral dose. In children, a dose of 20 mg/kg is given [4].
Viral conjunctivitis does not respond to antibiotics. Significant symptomatic relief can be obtained with the use of cold compresses and local vasoconstrictors, which also can be used for patients with allergic conjunctivitis. Topical steroids should never be used without the direct supervision of an ophthalmologist.

KERATITIS AND CORNEAL ULCERATION
Keratitis and corneal ulceration are common causes of painful, red eyes and are usually uni-ocular. Severe photophobia is often the main symptom, and the vision is usually blurred. Secondary uveitis may develop and cause ciliary injection. Ciliary injection shows a ring of redness, which is most intense around the limbus, and is a sign of inflammation of the ciliary body and iris. A history of trauma can often be elicited. At other times, a corneal ulcer and, more especially,

keratitis may occur as a result of viral or severe bacterial conjunctivitis, in  which  case  the  signs  of  conjunctivitis  may  coexist.  Sometimes, corneal ulcers develop spontaneously, especially with herpetic keratitis and are particularly common following measles.
The most important diagnostic sign is the appearance of a corneal defect - either an opacity, which will obscure underlying iris details, or a surface defect, which will distort the surface light reflex. If an ulcer penetrates  the  cornea,  the  globe  may  collapse  and  the  intraocular contents  may be expelled.  The hole in the cornea may be plugged with a knuckle of iris which then shows as dark tissue in the base of the ulcer. A  small ulcer, such as a dendritic ulcer caused by herpes simplex, is best seen if fluorescein is instilled and the eye is observed with a blue light. Large infective ulcers frequently are filled with white sloughed material and other debris. At times, pus may accumulate in the anterior chamber as a hypopyon.
Most  corneal  ulcers  are  medical  emergencies  and  these  patients should be under the care of an ophthalmologist. Proper management frequently requires a microbiologic diagnosis of the infectious agent, using  isolation  cultures.  Intensive  topical  antibiotics  are  used.  For bacterial keratitis, commercially available antibiotics drops, e.g. chloramphenicol, ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin, can be used every hour.

KERATITIS AND CORNEAL ULCERATION
Fungal keratitis is a major cause of infectious keratitis in tropical areas of the world. It represents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge and clinicians need a high index of suspicion if keratitis was presumed to be bacterial but does not respond well to empirical antibiotic treatment. The corneal infiltrate typically has fluffy margins. Treatment is usually either topical natamycin or amphotericin drops (hourly initially,  then  tapering  over  more  than  2 weeks  or  until infection has resolved).
If a characteristic dendritic lesion (Fig. 9.5) can be seen on the cornea and if the cornea has decreased sensation, a presumptive diagnosis of herpetic keratitis can be made. Dendritic ulcers are most appropriately treated with topical antiviral agents, e.g. trifluridine drops (eight times per day) or acyclovir ointment (five times per day) for 1 week [5]. Oral acyclovir  is  often  also  administered.  A  mydriatic,  such  as  2% homatropine (three times per day) may be used until the ulcer has healed.
Parasitic  infections  represent  a  rare  but  severe  cause  of  infectious keratitis. Acanthamoeba is the most common. Treatment is polyhexamethylene  biguanide  (PHMB)  0.02%  drops  and  Brolene  drops administered hourly.

CORNEAL NECROSIS
A number of systemic conditions are associated with corneal ulceration and necrosis, including collagen vascular diseases, leukemia and granulomatoses.  In  developing  countries,  nutritional  keratopathy relating to vitamin A deficiency (xerophthalmia, keratomalacia) is a common  cause  of  childhood  blindness  (Chapter  139).  In  many poorer Asian countries, measles is an important precipitating event for  xerophthalmia (Chapter 28.1).  Even  in well-nourished Western children, measles may cause a mild, superficial, self-limiting keratitis that does not require therapy. In much of Africa, however, measles itself is considered an important blinding condition. The mechanism is not entirely clear. In many instances, it represents precipitation of acute  xerophthalmia,  as  in  Asia.  In  others,  it  appears  to  represent secondary herpetic infection, which also accounts for the accompanying  stomatitis  and  skin  ulcers.  In  still  others,  corneal  damage  is  a chemical  keratitis  or  bacterial  infection  secondary  to  the  common practice of placing herbal and other traditional medicines in the eyes of measles patients.

CHUNK 11
============================================================
CORNEAL TRAUMA
With trauma, ocular signs and symptoms are usually unilateral and the onset is sudden. A history of trauma or foreign bodies is usually present.  Conjunctival  foreign  bodies  cause  pain  and  a  feeling  of having 'something in the eye'. Conjunctival vascular injection and some watering of the eye are usually present. A foreign body may be seen  with  a  simple  external  examination.  At  other  times,  however, conjunctival foreign bodies lodge behind the upper eyelid and are not seen until the lid is everted, at which time they can be easily removed.
A corneal foreign body usually produces more severe pain and photophobia. After some time, it will often cause a secondary inflammation with ciliary-limbal injection. Most corneal foreign bodies can be removed fairly easily with a cotton-tipped swab, but if this is not possible,  the  case  should  be  referred  to  an  ophthalmologist.  A  single application  of  antibiotic  ointment  may  be  used  prophylactically, if available.
In tropical environments in particular, corneal abrasions from plant matter, whether or not they leave a foreign body behind, carry a high risk of subsequent fungal infection. These can be notoriously difficult to treat and should be watched for closely.

Chemical burns to the eyes are best treated with immediate, thorough and copious irrigation. Ideally, sterile saline solution should be used, but rather than delay irrigation, tap water should be used if saline is not  available.  The  damage  caused  by  an  acid  burn  can  usually  be determined  immediately. Because  alkali continues  to penetrate the  eye,  alkaline  burns  are  frequently  much  more  severe  than initially  realized.  All  chemical  burns  should  be  assessed  by  an ophthalmologist.

CORNEAL TRAUMA
Conjunctival hemorrhages, which may be traumatic or spontaneous, require no treatment and will resolve in 1 to 2 weeks. Minor conjunctival lacerations do not require suturing and will heal in a few days. Topical antibiotics are usually given until the eye has healed.
All cases of penetrating trauma to the eye and laceration to the globe, including  corneal  lacerations  and  intraocular  foreign  bodies,  are medical  emergencies  that  require  prompt  referral  to  and  careful assessment by an ophthalmologist.

============================================================
CHUNK 13
============================================================
UVEITIS
The classification of uveitis may be anatomical, clinical, pathological or etiological. All systems may be useful for management purposes.
Anterior uveitis is a relatively uncommon cause of a sore, red eye. The term is used to describe inflammation of the anterior uveal structures - the iris and the ciliary body. The less common posterior uveitis refers to inflammation of the retina and choroid.
Uveitis may occur as a primary event, either in isolation or in association with some underlying systemic disease. Causes are considered to be infective, noninfective or masquerades (Table 9-3) [6]. Secondary anterior uveitis is commonly  seen with corneal trauma and ulceration.
Primary anterior uveitis has a gradual onset, with moderate to severe pain and some blurring of vision. It may be unilateral or bilateral, and the patient may have a history of similar episodes. Ciliary injection is the most important feature. This injection decreases with distance from the limbus, and the conjunctiva of the fornices and lids is not inflamed. There is usually no discharge.
The  other  important  sign  in  anterior  uveitis  is  a  pupillary  change. The pupil is usually small and reacts poorly to light. Frequently, the pupil  is  irregular  because  of  adhesions,  called  posterior  synechiae, between the pupillary margin and the lens. On examination with a slit lamp, keratic precipitates or inflammatory cells may be seen on the back of the cornea and also inflammatory cells and an aqueous 'flare' in the anterior chamber. In severe cases, these changes may be recognized during the examination of the front of the eye with an
ophthalmoscope, using the + 10 diopter lens. Posterior uveitis may be asymptomatic or involve severe vision loss if inflammation involves the macula.
Due to possible secondary causes, patients with recurrent episodes of anterior uveitis or other systemic symptoms should be examined in detail to exclude the possibility of such an underlying condition. All patients with posterior uveitis warrant further investigation.

============================================================
CHUNK 14
============================================================
UVEITIS
Treatment  for  anterior  uveitis  involves  cycloplegia  and  mydriasis obtained with  topical  drops,  such as  atropine  1%  (three  times per day).  A  systemic analgesic,  such  as  aspirin, will often give  symptomatic relief. Topical steroids are frequently indicated, but they should be given only at the direction of an ophthalmologist. If an underlying disease such as syphilis, tuberculosis or brucellosis is present, targeted systemic treatment should also be initiated. In severe uveitis and in chronic  uveitis,  secondary  cataracts  and  secondary  glaucoma  may develop. These conditions require specific treatment.
Posterior  uveitis  is  difficult  to  manage  and  requires  referral  to  an ophthalmologist to manage the ocular inflammation and to investigate further. Treatment may involve topical, intraocular and systemic steroids or antimicrobials.

============================================================
CHUNK 15
============================================================
Endophthalmitis
Endophthalmitis refers to diffuse inflammation of the eye including uveitis and vitritis. Patients usually present with loss of vision. Involvement of the eye can be 'exogenous' following eye surgery or trauma, or  'endogenous'  representing  hematogenous  seeding  of  the  eye during  bacteremia  or  fungemia.  Patients  often  do  not  have  fever unless there is an ongoing systemic infection. Examination of the eye may  disclose  a  hypopyon  and  haziness  of  the  vitreous.  Treatment involves intraocular antibiotics, and all patients with endophthalmitis should  be  referred  to  an  ophthalmologist.  Endogenous  infections should also be systemically treated.

============================================================
CHUNK 16
============================================================
ACUTE ANGLE-CLOSURE GLAUCOMA
Acute angle-closure  glaucoma is a relatively uncommon cause of a painful, red eye, although its diagnosis is of great importance because irreversible  blindness  can  result  without  prompt  treatment.  Acute angle-closure  glaucoma  is  characterized  by  a  sudden  increase  in intraocular pressure when the drainage channels for the intraocular fluid  (aqueous  humor)  are  obstructed.  The  persistence  of  elevated intraocular  pressure  can  cause  permanent  and  total  loss  of  vision within 1 to 2 days. The condition is most frequent in Asian populations  due  to  the  anatomically  short  eye.  A  mature  cataractous lens causes further crowding of the anterior segment and predisposes to angle-closure.
Acute angle-closure glaucoma usually starts with sudden and severe ocular  pain,  often  severe  enough  to  cause  nausea  and  vomiting. Vision is markedly reduced, and the patient often complains of seeing halos or colored rings around lights. On examination, there may be ciliary  injection,  but  the  most  striking  features  are  the  'steamy'  or hazy  cornea  and  the  greatly  increased  intraocular  pressure.  The corneal changes are due to corneal edema. Intraocular pressure can be assessed by gently palpating the globe through the closed upper lid  and comparing the degree of resilience of the affected eye with that of the other eye, or with that of the eye of a person with normal vision. Increased intraocular pressure causes the eye to feel firmer or hard.
The anterior chamber is usually very shallow in angle-closure glaucoma, and  the  iris  appears  to  be  almost  touching  the  cornea.  The pupil is  frequently  found to be semi-dilated and  unreactive, and it may have an irregular or vertically oval shape.
Medical  attempts  to  reduce  intraocular  pressure  in  such  patients should  be  started  without  delay.  Diuretics  such  as  acetazolamide, 500 mg  orally  or  intravenously,  should  be  given  up  to  four  times daily.  Any  available  anti-glaucoma  pressure-lowering  topical  drops should also be given frequently. These patients require referral to an ophthalmologist. An iridectomy or laser iridotomy is generally indicated to prevent further episodes. Pilocarpine 1-2% should be initiated twice daily in the fellow eye to reduce the risk of an acute attack until definitive surgical prophylaxis [7].

CHRONIC DISEASES
Refractive  error,  cataracts,  glaucoma  and  macular  degeneration  are major causes of blindness in aged populations of both developed and developing countries.

============================================================
CHUNK 18
============================================================
REFRACTIVE ERROR
Refractive errors include short-sightedness (myopia) and longsightedness (hyperopia) with or without astigmatism (when an eye can only sharply focus a line in one meridian). These conditions can be rectified with appropriate optical correction. This is a cost-effective intervention  and  has  an  important  impact  on  development  and quality of life. Presbyopia is the progressive loss of near-vision ability that occurs in everyone over about 40 years of age. This may be easily corrected  with  ready-made  magnifiers.  Cost  and  access  barriers  to appropriate refractive correction are a problem in many developing areas, but much work is being carried out to rectify this situation.

============================================================
CHUNK 19
============================================================
CATARACT
Opacification of the lens interferes with transmission of clear images to the retina by both decreasing and scattering the light rays as they pass through. To the examiner, the pupillary area may look opaque and whitish or dark brown on hand-light illumination, and fundus details  will  be  obscured  when  viewed  with  the  direct  ophthalmoscope. Aside from cataracts of rare congenital origin and those that result from chronic inflammation, most cataracts are lumped together under the heading 'senile' . These are undoubtedly of multifactorial origin. Because the precise causes of such cataracts are as yet unknown, preventive measures do not currently exist. Cataracts can be surgically removed with a high degree of technical success and likelihood of return of useful vision.
In general, cataracts are the leading cause of blindness in developing countries. Visually disabling cataracts appear to occur earlier in life in some cultures than in others. More importantly, surgical therapy is commonly unavailable to large segments of the population.  Some countries are overcoming the paucity and maldistribution of ophthalmologists by conducting intensive rural 'cataract camps'; others are doing so by training properly supervised paramedical personnel to remove cataracts. Because the potential for intraoperative complications and postoperative infections is high under these circumstances, these approaches require careful consideration and detailed organization.  However,  as  no  other  recourse  often  exists,  these  methods require further development and extension.
Merely  removing  an  advanced  cataract  can  improve  vision,  but removal alone will not restore reading acuity. Some form of aphakic correction,  most  commonly intraocular lenses or spectacles, is also required.

============================================================
CHUNK 20
============================================================
GLAUCOMA
There  are  two  major  forms  of  glaucoma  -  acute  and  chronic.  As already  discussed,  the  acute  form,  with  its  red,  injected,  painful eyes, is the more dramatic. Chronic open-angle glaucoma, however, is  much  more  common  and  is  the  more  important  cause  of blindness.
Chronic  elevation  of  intraocular  pressure,  at  levels  below  those reached  in  acute  angle-closure  glaucoma,  results  in  progressive destruction of the optic nerve. After many years (usually 10 to 20), this painless, asymptomatic destruction of the optic nerve results in loss  of  visual  field,  detectable  by  careful  visual  field  examination. Antiglaucoma therapy may delay or prevent further damage, but it cannot replace the vision that has already been lost. Unfortunately, patients are usually unaware of the problem until late in the course
of the disease, when central acuity is finally involved and little vision or optic nerve remains to be saved.
Glaucoma  is  the  classic  disease  in  which  screening  methods  have played an important role. Unfortunately, the simplest technique, that of demonstrating by tonometry that the intraocular pressure is greater than 21 mmHg, is far from infallible. Half of those with established glaucomatous field loss will have a normal pressure on a single casual screening test, and only 1 in 20 or 30 people with an elevated pressure will  already  have  field  loss.  The  higher  the  pressure,  however,  the greater the likelihood of having, or soon developing, field loss. Screening  is  improved  by combining tonometry with examination of the optic disc (by direct ophthalmoscopy or, preferably, with a slit lamp and contact lens). Deep, large, asymmetric optic disc cupping, equal to or greater than 0.6 disc diameter, suggests glaucomatous damage.
Ultimately, diagnosis requires demonstration of classic changes in the visual fields.
Treatment consists of lowering the intraocular pressure  below 21 mmHg or to whatever level prevents further damage. A variety of topical  medications  may  accomplish  this:  prostaglandin  analogues are generally used first-line in developed countries. Beta-blockers such as timolol are less expensive and equally effective at lowering intraocular pressure. Alpha-agonists, e.g. brimonidine, and topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are also used. If one agent proves inadequate, others may be added to the regimen.

============================================================
CHUNK 21
============================================================
GLAUCOMA
Glaucoma management requires careful monitoring of pressure and visual field  and frequent  adjustment of dosage and regimen, while compliance of patients with the treatment plan is generally poor.
Laser trabeculoplasty is effective at lowering intraocular pressure for 5-10  years  and  has  far  less  complications  than  surgery.  Improved compliance is a significant advantage over the topical medications. The treatment is also cost-effective as initial treatment.
When  visual  field  loss  continues,  even  on  'maximum'  medical therapy, the patient requires filtering surgery. A small channel is produced through the tough outer coats of the eye, so that some of the aqueous may percolate out of the eye into the subconjunctival space, where it is absorbed. Such artificial channels are at least temporarily successful, after one or more operations, in 85% of Caucasian patients. African patients do not fare so well because of their greater tendency for scarring, which closes the new channel. Concomitant local use of antimetabolites increases success.
Despite the potential for preventative measures, glaucoma is an especially  difficult  clinical  problem  in  tropical  countries;  screening  and diagnostic procedures are time-consuming and complex, and medical therapy  is  expensive,  requires  careful  monitoring,  and  usually  is attended by poor compliance.

AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION
In temperate climates, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the first  or  second  leading  cause  of  blindness.  AMD  has  received  little attention in the tropics because it is difficult to diagnose without a dilated pupil fundus examination, occurs mainly in the elderly, and does not have easily available treatment options.
AMD has a strong genetic basis and is also associated with cigarette smoking [8]. Early in the disease, scattered, white, deep-retinal dots, known as drusen, can be seen concentrated in the macular area. Some, but  not  all,  people with  these  signs  eventually  develop  progressive degeneration of their retinal pigment epithelium and the underlying choroid. Loss of vision is gradual, unpredictable, and is usually confined  to  loss  of  fine  reading  acuity.  Patients  rarely  develop  'black blindness' (total loss of vision) and can usually care for themselves. In some, a net of new blood vessels grows from the choroid, and these vessels may leak or bleed. Such vascular networks may be treated with injections  in  the  eye  of  anti-VEGF  agents.  However,  these  are  very expensive,  seldom  available,  and  require  repeated  administration. Laser treatment may also be effective for certain subtypes.

DIABETIC RETINOPATHY
Diabetic retinopathy includes a wide, complex spectrum of changes. Because few long-time diabetics survive in the poor, rural communities of developing countries, diabetic retinopathy is less common than in developed countries and in increasingly affluent urban communities elsewhere. The major treatable component of the disease is the growth  of  neovascular  membranes  which  extend  into  the  vitreous from the  surface  of  the  optic  nerve  or  retina.  Timely  laser  therapy provides  substantial  benefit  and  dramatically  reduces  the  risk  of blindness. Laser treatment also benefits patients with fluid accumulation in the macula (macular edema) if they are treated early. Diabetics should have their eyes examined annually if possible to ensure that suitable laser treatment is applied prior to the development of sightthreatening complications.

PROPTOSIS
Abnormal protrusion of the eye is uncommon but usually signifies serious orbital pathology. Although included in this chronic section, there  are  a  number  of  acute  causes.  Causes  include:  inflammatory disease, e.g. thyroid eye disease; infection, e.g. orbital cellulitis (bacterial, parasitic, fungal); tumors; and vascular anomalies, e.g. carotidcavernous fistula (perhaps after trauma).
