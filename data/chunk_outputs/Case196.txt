Key features
- Microsporidia are a diverse group of obligate intracellular eukaryotic parasites most closely related to fungi
- Microsporidia form characteristic spores that are diagnostic for the phylum. Spores possess a unique organelle-the polar tubule or polar 1lament-which is coiled inside the spore
- Spores of species associated with human infection measure 1-4 μ m
- While Microsporidia can infect immunocompetent hosts, they are more commonly seen in the setting of cellmediated immune dysfunction
- The most common manifestations of infection are diarrhea and keratoconjunctivitis; however, Microsporidia can infect virtually any organ, causing a variety of symptoms, including disseminated disease, hepatitis, myositis, kidney and urogenital infection, ascites, cholangitis, and asymptomatic carriage
- Examination of stool or urine specimens using special stains is a practical method for the diagnosis of microsporidiosis. De1nitive species diagnosis requires transmission electron microscopy visualization of spore ultrastructure or molecular methods (PCR)
- Albendazole is the drug of choice to treat gastroenteritis caused by Encephalitozoon intestinalis and to treat disseminated microsporidiosis with or without local manifestations ( Encephalitozoon hellem , Encephalitozoon cuniculi , E. intestinalis , Pleistophora sp., Trachipleistophora sp., Brachiola vesicularum )
- Fumagillin is the drug of choice to treat gastroenteritis and disseminated infection caused by Enterocytozoon bieneusi , but is associated with thrombocytopenia
- The treatment of choice for ocular microsporidiosis ( E. hellem , E. cuniculi , Vittaforma corneae ) is oral albendazole plus topical fumagillin. Corneal infections with V. corneae often do not respond to chemotherapy and may require keratoplasty

INTRODUCTION
First recognized by Nageli in 1857 as the cause of disease in silkworms, microsporidia were not suspected as being a cause of human disease until 1959, when they were found in a child with encephalitis. Conclusive evidence of Microsporidia as pathogens dates to 1973, when a 4-month-old athymic boy died with severe diarrhea and malabsorption caused by Nosema (now Anncaliia ) connori (Fig. 104.1). Interest and knowledge of microsporidia as parasites of man have expanded dramatically since they  were first described  as  a  cause  of persistent diarrhea and systemic disease in persons with AIDS [1].
Microsporidia are obligate intracellular parasites which are classified in  a  separate  phylum-the  Microsporidia-consisting  of  approximately 170 genera and more than 1200 species [2, 3]. They are classified  based  on  their  ultrastructural  features,  including  size  and morphology of the spores, number of coils of the polar tube, developmental lifecycle and host-parasite relationship [4]. Molecular data, based primarily on small subunit RNA genes, have also been used to define taxonomic relationships and for the diagnosis of these pathogens.  Although  traditionally  believed  to  be  'primitive'  protozoa, molecular phylogenetic analysis has suggested that the Microsporidia are instead related to the Fungi [5, 6]. The genome size of the Microsporidia varies from 2.3 to 19.5 Mb with that of the Encephalitizoonidae  being  less  than  3.0  Mb,  making  them  among  the  smallest eukaryotic nuclear genomes so far identified.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
The Microsporidia infect virtually all animal phyla, including other protists. They have a worldwide distribution and are important agricultural  parasites  in  insects,  fish,  and  mammals.  They  have  been found in every tissue and organ, and spores are common in environmental sources [2]. Many human infections are likely zoonotic and/ or transmitted by water [7]. Domestic and wild animals may be naturally infected with E. cuniculi , E. intestinalis , and Enterocytozoon bieneusi . Birds, especially parrots (parakeets, love birds, budgies), are naturally infected  with E.  hellem . Enterocytozoon  bieneusi and V.  corneae have

been identified  in  surface  waters,  and  spores  of Nosema sp.  (likely Anncaliia  algerae )  have  been  identified  in  ditchwater.  Human-tohuman transmission is likely although not proven.
Prevalence of microsporidiosis varies from not detected to over 80% depending on the geographic region, method of diagnosis and demographic characteristics of the population being studied. Microsporidiosis is increasingly recognized in non-HIV-infected populations, such as travelers, children, the elderly and organ transplant recipients. Most infections  in  immunocompetant  and  naïve  hosts  are  likely  selflimited or asymptomatic. Current understanding suggests that Microsporidia are as common in humans as they are in other mammals, and are associated with travel or residence in developing nations [8]. Microsporidal  keratitis  is  increasingly  recognized  in  endemic  areas and is likely associated with exposure to soil, muddy water and minor trauma, with higher incidence during the rainy season [9].

============================================================
NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
The Microsporidia are single-cell, intracellular parasites containing a nucleus  with  a  nuclear  envelope,  an  intracytoplasmic  membrane system, chromosome separation on mitotic spindles, a vesicular Golgi and a mitochondrial 'remnant' . The infectious spore is characteristic of  the  phylum:  it  is  unicellular  with  an  environmentally-resistant spore wall, one or two nuclei and an extrusion apparatus consisting of a single polar tube with an anterior attachment complex. During germination, the polar tube rapidly everts forming a hollow tube that both transports and inoculates the sporoplasm into the host cell [2].
Most  microsporidial  infections  occur  when  infectious  spores  are ingested  or  inhaled. Enterocytozoon  bieneusi ,  the  most  frequently encountered intestinal microsporidia in patients with AIDS, primarily causes  intestinal  infections  with  less  frequent  extra-intestinal  infections.  Like E.  bieneusi , Encephalitozoon  intestinalis may infect enterocytes and cause chronic diarrhea. However, through the infection of macrophages, E. intestinalis can disseminate to different organs, especially the kidneys, from which spores are shed in the urine.

============================================================
CHUNK 4
============================================================
NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
The  lifecycle  of  microsporidia  begins  when  the  spores  germinate, resulting in the extrusion of its polar tubule and infects a host epithelial cell or is phagocytosed by a host cell. The spore injects the infective sporoplasm into the eukaryotic host cell or into a parasitophorous vacuole  through  the  polar  tubule.  Inside  the  cell,  the  sporoplasm undergoes  extensive  multiplication  either  by  merogony  (binary fission) or schizogony (multiple fission). This development can occur either in direct contact with the host cell cytoplasm (e.g. E. bieneusi ) or inside a parasitophorous vacuole (e.g. E. intestinalis ). Either free in the  cytoplasm  or  inside  a  parasitophorous  vacuole,  microsporidia develop by sporogony to mature spores. During sporogony, a thick wall is formed around the spore, which provides resistance to adverse environmental conditions. When the spores increase in number and completely fill the host cell cytoplasm, the cell membrane is disrupted and releases the spores to the surroundings. These free mature spores can infect new cells, thus continuing the cycle.
Within their hosts, most species infect the digestive tract, but reproductive, respiratory, muscular, excretory and nervous system infections are well documented [2]. Microsporidiosis in humans is most often identified in the setting of immune deficiencies (especially in patients with AIDS) [7]. A strong humoral response occurs during infection and includes antibodies that react with the spore wall and polar tube. The immunosuppressed states associated with microsporidiosis (e.g. AIDS  and  transplantation)  are  characterized  by  defects  in  cellmediated  immunity.  Spontaneous  cure  of  microsporidiosis  can  be induced by immune reconstitution with combination anti-retroviral treatment (cART) [10].

CLINICAL FEATURES
Microsporidian genera associated with human disease and their site of infection are described in Table 104-1. Human microsporidiosis represents an important and emerging opportunistic disease, occurring  mainly,  but  not  exclusively,  in  severely  immunocompromised patients with AIDS. Additionally, cases of microsporidiosis in immunocompromised persons not infected with HIV, as well as in immunocompetent  persons,  also  have  been  reported.  Microsporidia  is likely  a  common enteric pathogen causing self-limited disease and asymptomatic carriage. The clinical manifestations of microsporidiosis  are  very  diverse,  varying  according  to  the  causal  species,  with chronic  or  persistent  diarrhea  being  the  most  common  presenting syndrome. Microsporidiosis can also present as keratoconjunctivitis, disseminated disease, hepatitis, myositis, kidney and urogenital infection, ascites and/or cholangitis.
The genus Microsporidium is used to designate Microsporidia of uncertain  taxonomic status. No one genus is uniquely associated with a specific  clinical  syndrome;  rather,  there  is  considerable  overlap  in clinical disease across species.

Chronic diarrhea and ocular infections are the most common presentations  in  immunocompetent  hosts. Enterocytozoon  bieneusi has been identified as a cause of self-limited diarrhea in immunocompetent  patients  and  travelers,  and  has  been  found  in  up  to  10%  of African children with diarrhea. Encephalitozoon intestinalis was found in 8% of the stools of patients in a survey for the etiology of diarrhea in Mexico and has been seen in travelers with chronic diarrhea (Fig. 104-2). Cerebral infections owing to Encephalitozoon sp. were identified serologically in a 3-year-old boy with seizures and hepatomegaly and a 9-year-old Japanese boy with headache, vomiting, spastic convulsions and recurrent fever. An unidentified Microsporidia responsive to albendazole was described causing multiple cerebral lesions in a 33- year-old man in Japan. Pleistophora spp . have been identified in the skeletal muscle of an HIV-negative patient with myositis.
Ocular infections with ulcer or deep cornea stroma infection associated with eye pain have been reported in immune-competent patients [1 1].  In  1973  and  1981,  two  cases  were  documented  in  immune

Other cases of keratitis have since been identified to be caused by Nosema ocularum and N . corneum (now V. cornea ). Treatment of these infections has often required surgery (keratoplasty and/or corneal transplant). Encephalitozoon spp. and Trachipleistophora anthropophthera corneal  infections  have  been  described  in  contact lens-wearers. These infections have responded to topical therapy. In a report from India on 40 immune competent patients, epidemic keratoconjuctivits has been associated with Microsporidia [12]. Many of these resolved without specific treatment.

INFECTIONS IN PATIENTS WITH IMMUNE DEFICIENCIES
While the majority of reported infections have been in patients with AIDS (and CD4 counts less than 100 cells/mm 3 ), infections have been seen in organ transplantation patients, patients with various hematologic malignancies and those being treated with immunosuppressive medications (especially antibodies to tumor necrosis factor [TNF]α ). Gastrointestinal infection usually involves chronic diarrhea of 3-10 bowel movements per day, anorexia, weight loss and bloating without associated fever. It is usually caused by E. bieneusi and, occasionally,
E.  intestinalis; however, other microsporida have also been demonstrated in cases of diarrheal disease (e.g. Anncaliia connori , Vittaforma spp.,  E.  hellem,  E.  cuniculi ).  In  patients  undergoing  liver  and  bone marrow transplantation, clinical manifestations have included watery, non-bloody diarrhea; nausea; and diffuse abdominal pain. Kotler and Orenstein found that 39% of patients with HIV and diarrhea, presenting  to  a  gastroenterology  clinic  had  microsporidosis  and  that  the presence of Microsporidia was associated with wasting, a mean CD4 count of 28 cells/mm 3 and an abnormal D-xylose test result, whereas only  2.6%  of  HIV-infected  patients  without  diarrhea  had  microsporidiosis [13]. Coyle and colleagues, using PCR employing primers to the small subunit rRNA gene of E. bieneusi , also found a significant association  between the  presence of  diarrhea  and Microsporidia in patients with AIDS [1 1].
Ocular infection in immune compromised hosts has been restricted to the superficial epithelium of the cornea and conjunctiva (i.e. superficial keratoconjunctivitis) (Fig. 104.3). This keratitis rarely progresses to  corneal  ulceration.  Most  patients  present  with  bilateral  coarse punctate epithelial keratopathy and conjunctival inflammation resulting in redness, foreign body sensation, photophobia and changes in visual  acuity  [14].  Biopsy  specimens  examined  with  transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have revealed numerous microsporidian

Examination of stool specimens by light microscopy using modified trichrome  stain  (chromotrope  2R)  (Fig.  104.5),  Uvitex  2B  or  calcofluor white is the standard method for diagnosing gastrointestinal microsporidiosis. Overall, the sensitivity of Uvitex 2B and calcofluor white is slightly higher than that of modified trichrome stain; however, the  specificity  of  the  chemofluorescent  stains  is  lower.  Microscopy does not allow identification of microsporidia to the species level.

The  most  widely  used  staining  technique  is  the  Chromotrope  2R method or its modifications. This technique stains the spore and the spore wall a bright pinkish red. Often, a belt-like stripe, which also stains pinkish red, is seen in the middle of the spore. However, this technique is lengthy and time consuming, requiring about 90 min. The 'Quick-Hot Gram Chromotrope technique' cuts down the staining time to less than 10 minutes and provides a good differentiation from the lightly stained background fecal materials so that the spores stand out for easy visualization [15]. The spores stain dark violet and the belt-like stripe is enhanced. In some cases, dark staining Grampositive granules are also clearly seen. Chemofluorescent agents, such as  Calcofluor  white,  are  also  useful  in  the  quick  identification  of spores in fecal smears. The spores measure 0.8-1.4 μ m in the case of E. bieneusi and 1.5-4 μ m in B. algerae , Encephalitozoon spp., V. corneae , and Nosema spp.  If  stool  examination  is  negative  in  the  setting  of chronic  diarrhea  (more  than  two  months'  duration),  endoscopy should be performed. In patients with enteric microsporidiosis undergoing endoscopy, the small intestine has provided the highest diagnostic  yield,  but  organisms  have  also  been  seen  in  colonic  biopsy material.
Definitive  species  diagnosis  of  microsporidiosis  currently  requires TEM visualization of spore ultrastructure (Fig. 104.3D) and developmental stages or molecular methods (PCR). TEM is expensive, timeconsuming  and  not  feasible  for  routine  diagnosis.  Species-specific rRNA primers for PCR have been described and are available in reference  laboratories  [e.g.  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention (CDC)]. Thus, molecular diagnosis with species-specific PCR primers is  commonly believed to be the gold standard for identification of microsporidian species [16].

PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
As renal involvement with shedding of spores in the urine is common in all of the species of Microsporidia that disseminate, urine specimens should be obtained whenever the diagnosis of microsporidiosis is considered. This has therapeutic implications, as the Microsporidia that disseminate (e.g. Encephalitozoon ) are usually sensitive to albendazole, whereas those that do not disseminate (e.g. E.  bieneusi )  are resistant. In tissue sections (Figs 104.2 and 104.5), touch preparations or corneal scrapings (Figs 104.3B, C), Microsporidia are discernible with  hematoxylin-eosin,  Giemsa,  tissue  Gram  or  chromotrope  2R stains.  Histologically,  microsporidian  spores  are  easily  discernible with a modified tissue chromotrope 2R or tissue Gram stain (BrownHopp or Brown-Brenn) in sections prepared from fixed tissue using routine procedures.

TREATMENT (Table 104-1)
Microsporidiosis is primarily an opportunistic infection in the immunocompromised host.
Studies  have  demonstrated  that  immune  reconstitution  can  result in  clinical  response  in  patients  with  microsporidiosis  secondary  to immune dysfunction. Immune reconstitution with cART in patients with AIDS or reversal of iatrogenic immunosuppression, when possible, is an important management principle [2].
Immune  reconstitution  syndrome  (IRIS)  has  been  reported  in a  patient  with  microsporidiosis  treated  with  anti-retroviral  therapy [17]; however, based on clinical experience, IRIS reactions are not common in this setting. Aspartyl protease inhibitors of HIV have  been  shown  to  inhibit  replication  of E.  intestinalis in  tissue culture.
Albendazole is a benzimidazole effective against many helminths and protozoa that inhibits  microtubule  assembly.  Albendazole  was initially shown effective in severely immunosuppressed ( < 50 CD4 cells/ ml) patients with AIDS with systemic disease, disseminated infection with E. intestinalis and chronic diarrhea. Treatment with albendazole 400 mg twice daily resulted in a dramatic and rapid clinical resolution of diarrhea and transient elimination of the organism from feces and urine  [18]. In a subsequent small, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial, albendazole at 400 mg twice daily for three weeks led to rapid  clinical  improvement  and  elimination  of  the  pathogen  [19]. Prevention of relapse is best accomplished by immune reconstitution but  albendazole  at  400mg  twice  daily  was  shown  to  significantly delay relapse [19]. Treatment with albendazole for intestinal disease caused by E. bieneusi in patients with AIDS has not proven effective. Albendazole at 400 mg twice daily for one month in patients with chronic diarrhea, weight loss and malabsorption did not clear infection, although there was a statistically significant decrease in bowel movements from seven per day to four per day [20].

TREATMENT (Table 104-1)
Albendazole  has  also  been  used  for  the  treatment  of  clinical  syndromes caused by microsporidia other than E.  intestinalis although clinical trial data is lacking. Clinical and radiographic improvement was seen in a case of chronic sinusitis caused by E. hellem treated with albendazole 400 mg bid. Marked clinical improvement with albendazole occurred in a patient with disseminated infection caused by E. cuniculi involving the conjunctiva, sinuses, kidneys and lungs. Resolution  of  myositis  was  noted  in  patients  infected  with  a Nosema -like microsporidian and in a case of disseminated infection with myositis caused by T . hominis treated with albendazole. Albendazole as a systemic agent is indicated if the organism is demonstrated in the urine or in nasal smears of patients with keratoconjunctivitis.
Albendazole is recommended for the treatment of acute microsporidial infections in  immunocompetant non-immune  children in endemic areas and also returning travelers. In a randomized, open study  in  Costa  Rica,  albendazole  at  15 mg/kg/day  twice  a  day  for seven days was effective in improving clinical symptoms and decreasing duration of illness from 10 days to 5 days in children ages 6-36 months [21].The data in returning adult travelers are less robust but if  microsporidial  spores  are  detected  in  a  patent  with  persistent diarrhea, a trial of albendazole would be indicated [22].

TREATMENT (Table 104-1)
Fumagillin, an antibiotic derived from the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus ,  have in  vitro and in vivo activity against E. cuniculi , E. hellem , E. intestinalis , E. bieneusi , Nucleospora ( Ent .) salmonis , and V. corneae . Fumagillin has been demonstrated in a dose-escalation trial, case reports and a randomized clinical trial to be effective for  the treatment  of human infection with E. bieneusi at a dose of 60 mg/day (20 mg three times daily) for 2 weeks [23]. The main limiting toxicity of treatment was  thrombocytopenia  beginning  about  a  week  after  initiation  of treatment and reaching a nadir three days after the end of treatment. Thrombocytopenia was reversible in 1-2 weeks on stopping fumagillin  treatment.  Complete  blood  counts  should  be  monitored  every other  day  and  the  drug  discontinued  if  platelet  counts  fall  below 75,000 per cubic millimeter. Oral fumagillin at 20 mg/kg 3 or 4 times daily  for  7-10  days  is  also  recommended  in  transplant-associated microsporidiosis  caused  by E.  bienusi ,  although  the  optimal  dose regimen has not been defined [24].
Solutions of the soluble salt, Fumidil B (fumagillin bicylohexylammonium), applied topically have been demonstrated to be nontoxic to the cornea and treatment of ocular microsporidiosis can be accomplished using a 3-mg/ml solution of Fumidil B in saline (fumagillin 70 μ g/ml) [1 1]. Treatment should probably be continued indefinitely, as recurrence has been reported upon stopping the drops.
The efficacy of imidazole compounds on microsporidiosis is variable. Other medications used without success in the treatment of gastrointestinal microsporidiosis are azithromycin, metronidazole, paromomycin, sulfamethoxazole and quinacrine.

TREATMENT (Table 104-1)
Microsporidal keratitis with and without systemic involvement is a specialized clinical manifestation that requires management in conjunction with an ophthalmologist. Topical flouroquinolones as monotherapy or in combination with topical fumagillin, topical steroids and systemic albendazole may all be appropriate depending on the extent of infection [25].
For a review of drugs used in microsporidiosis in humans and animals see Costa and Weiss [26]. Neither oral nor topical fumagillin is an approved drug by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are not easily available in the USA.

PREVENTION
As  the  Microsporida  that  infect  humans  are  likely  food-  or  waterborne pathogens, standard sanitary measures that prevent contamination of food and water with the urine and feces of animals should decrease the chance for infection. Hand-washing and general hygienic habits probably reduce the chance for contamination of the conjunctiva  and  cornea  in  contact  lens-wearers.  The  presence  of  infective spores in various bodily fluids suggests that universal precautions in healthcare settings and general attention to hand-washing and other personal hygiene measures should be useful in preventing primary infections.  Immune  compromised  patients  may  wish  to  consider using bottled or filtered water in some settings. No prophylactic antiparasitic agents have been identified for these organisms.
