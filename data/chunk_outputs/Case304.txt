INTRODUCTION
Rickettsialpox, a mite-borne and predominately urban zoonosis that cycles among house mice ( Mus musculus ) and house mouse mites ( Liponyssoides  sanguineus ),  was  discovered  by  physicians  in 1946 in the borough of Queens, New York City, United States. Investigators quickly isolated and described the causative agent, Rickettsia  akari (from the Greek word for mite ),  from mice and mites. Con{rmed or suspected cases of rickettsialpox have been reported from at least 14 countries around the world, making this disease  one  of  the  few  spotted-fever-group  rickettsioses  with  a cosmopolitan distribution. 1-4

============================================================

============================================================
EPIDEMIOLOGY
Most documented cases of rickettsialpox describe  patients who resided in New York City at the time of illness. 4-7 The disease has been described occasionally from other large metropolitan centers of the eastern United States, including Hartford, Boston, Baltimore, Philadelphia,  Cleveland,  and  Newark,  as  well  as  many  other countries, including Ukraine, Croatia, T urkey, South Korea, Mexico, and the Netherlands (Fig. 70.1). The disease likely occurs throughout many other regions of the world where M. musculus and L. sanguineus co-exist. Patients with antibodies reactive with R. akari have  been  described  from Albania,  Bosnia-Herzegovina,  Costa Rica, Central African Republic, France, Germany, and South Africa, although it remains to be determined whether these re|ect true infections  with R.  akari or  exposures  to  other  closely  related Rickettsia species. 3,8-13 Rickettsialpox occurs in patients of all ages, from infants as young as 6 months, to adults as old as 92 years. In  most patient series, the disease occurs equally among males and females, and cases are documented from all months of the year. Cases of rickettsialpox often cluster in time and space, and simultaneous  or  consecutive  illnesses  are  sometimes  observed among family members or other residents from a single common location. In contrast with most other rickettsioses, the majority of cases of rickettsialpox are described from large urban centers, consistent with the important role of peridomestic rodents in the distribution and occurrence of R. akari. 1,3,8

NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
R. akari is transmitted among house mice and several species of rodents by L. sanguineus. Humans become infected with R. akari only when a mite infected with rickettsiae cannot locate its natural host and is forced to obtain a blood meal from a human. In that context, ecologic factors that govern populations of house mice and L. sanguineus largely in|uence the emergence of rickettsialpox in human populations. R. akari has been cultured from house mice and  wild  rodent  species, 14,15 as  well  as  from  the  house  mouse mite. 16,17 Transovarial and trans-stadial transmission of rickettsiae occurs in L.  sanguineus to  implicate the mite as the most likely important reservoir host of R. akari.
Liponyssoides sanguineus (Fig. 70.2) is a minute (approximately 400-700 μ m) ectoparasite, typically found in proximity to rodent harborages  that  include  nests  and  burrows,  and  in  cracks  and crevices close to nesting sites. 18 Nymphal stages and adult mites ingest blood and can transmit R. akari to a susceptible host. Because of  its  small  size,  this  mite  is  almost  never  seen  by  patients. L.  sanguineus has  been  collected  from  house  mice  and  various rodent species in several states across the United States, as well as Egypt, Ukraine, Armenia, Turkmenistan, and Sicily. 3 Despite broad geographic distributions of the vector mite and the house mouse, con{rmed reports of rickettsialpox are relatively sparse and sporadic, suggesting that R. akari is distributed less ubiquitously than its principal vertebrate host or arthropod vector. The tropical rat mite ( Ornithonyssus bacoti ) can also serve as an ef{cient vector of R. akari under experimental conditions, and R. akari has been detected  in  trombiculid  mites  in  South  Korea,  suggesting  that other species of hematophagous mites could be involved in the natural history of this pathogen. 19,20

NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
R. akari does not stain well with conventional Gram- or eosinazure-based methods but does stain with Giménez, Macchiavello's, and other related techniques that use carbol-basic fuchsin. R. akari can be detected microscopically in host tissues by using immunohistochemical stains. Using these techniques, the bacteria appear as small (approximately 0.3 μ m × 1. 0 μ m) rods and coccobacilli situated in the cytoplasm of cells in in|amed foci in the dermis. R. akari is found predominantly in macrophages in the perivascular and  periadnexal  in|ammatory  cell  in{ltrates  of  the  cutaneous lesions and only rarely in vascular endothelial cells. The histopathology of the inoculation eschar demonstrates extensive necrosis of the epidermis and dermis, with subjacent perivascular and periadnexal in|ammatory cell in{ltrates and occasional panniculitis (Fig. 70.3). The histopathology of the rash is typically more variable and age-dependent; however, fully developed papulovesicles show subepidermal vesicle formation that is a characteristic histopathologic feature of rickettsialpox. In|amed blood vessels demonstrate varying degrees of endothelial swelling, blurring, or obliteration of the vessel wall by in|ammatory cell in{ltrates, mural necrosis, extravasation of red cells, or {brin thrombi (see Fig. 70.3). Lymphocytes and macrophages comprise the predominant in|ammatory cell  types, although neutrophils are occasionally present in and around necrotic foci. 21,22

eschar, is seen in > 90% of patients (T able 70.1). In its early stages, it is a painless, non-pruritic, erythematous papule that subsequently enlarges and develops a central vesicle containing clear or opaque |uid. Eventually, the vesicle ruptures and a dark brown or black crust develops over the lesion, forming the characteristic eschar (see Fig. 70.3). The eschar is often surrounded by a larger zone of erythema. Primary lesions range in size from 0.5 to 2.5 cm and are most frequently observed on the extremities but may be found anywhere on the body. T wo eschars can be identi{ed occasionally on separate anatomic sites. The eschar generally persists for 3 to 4 weeks and may heal to form a small, depressed scar. A cutaneous eruption develops in most patients 1 to 4 days after the onset of fever. This eruption is characterized by small (2-10 mm), discrete, erythematous  maculopapules  distributed  on  the  extremities, abdomen, back, chest, and face, and only rarely on the palms and soles. After 2 to 3 days, some lesions become indurated and develop a small vesicle containing cloudy |uid at the apex. The number of papules varies from 5 to more than 100, although most patients develop approximately 20 to 30 of these lesions. The rash is neither painful nor pruritic and generally resolves within 7 days to leave small, hyperpigmented spots. An enanthem occurs in approximately 20% to 25% of patients and is characterized by small (2-4 mm) vesicles, maculopapules, or erosions on the oral mucosae. 2,5-7,23,24

Patients with rickettsialpox typically develop fever, diaphoresis, lassitude,  myalgia,  and  headache  within  2  to  7  days  after  the appearance of the eschar. In patients who do not receive speci{c antibiotic therapy, these symptoms can persist for 7 to 10 days. The peak temperature is  38°  to  40°C,  although  it  may  rise  to 41°C. A headache, usually frontal and occasionally severe, occurs in approximately 90% to 100% of patients. Myalgia is common and is most often described as backache. Less frequently reported {ndings include conjunctivitis, splenomegaly, pharyngitis, nausea, and vomiting. Routine laboratory abnormalities often include mild leukopenia with a relative lymphocytosis and mildly elevated levels
of  aspartate  and  alanine  aminotransferases.  Rickettsialpox  is  a self-limited illness, and in most case series, patients are hospitalized infrequently. Moderate-to-severe manifestations are reported rarely and include hepatitis, photophobia, and nuchal rigidity. No deaths have been attributed to infection with R. akari . 25

PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Other rickettsial diseases, particularly those associated commonly with an eschar or a papulovesicular exanthem, can closely resemble rickettsialpox.  These  include  African  tick-bite  fever  (caused  by R. africae ), R. parkeri rickettsiosis, Queensland tick typhus (caused by R. australis ), and scrub typhus (caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi ) (see Table 70.1). Other infectious conditions with one or more clinical similarities include chickenpox and other herpetic dermatitides,
cutaneous  leishmaniasis,  tularemia,  melioidosis,  and  cutaneous anthrax. A carefully obtained patient history that includes questions about location of residence and work, and sightings of house mice in these settings, can provide additional diagnostic clues.

============================================================
PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Laboratory con{rmation of rickettsialpox is most often achieved by serology, and the indirect immuno|uorescence antibody (IFA) assay  is  the  reference  standard  for  serologic  procedures.  Most commercially available IFA assays use Rickettsia rickettsii (the agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever) as a surrogate antigen for R. akari because of high serologic cross-reactivity among rickettsiae of the spotted-fever group. Con{rmation requires a fourfold or greater rise in immunoglobulin G antibody titer in appropriately paired specimens. Ideally, the {rst specimen is obtained during the {rst week of illness and the second is collected 2 to 4 weeks after  complete  clinical  recovery.  Anti-rickettsial  antibodies  are absent in most infected patients during the {rst week of the illness, and results based on a single serum sample collected when the patient {rst presents for care are generally non-diagnostic. It is also important to recognize that antibody titers to spotted-fevergroup Rickettsia species are only group speci{c and IFA tests cannot be used to establish a species-speci{c diagnosis. When possible, more elaborate techniques, such as cross-adsorption or Western blotting, can be used to corroborate the diagnosis; however, these assays are generally restricted to specialized research laboratories and reference centers. 12,13 Most patients with rickettsialpox do not develop agglutinating antibodies against the OX-19, OX-2, and OX-K antigens of Proteus vulgaris (i.e., negative Weil-Felix reactions). A negative Weil-Felix test is considered a relatively consistent serologic feature of rickettsialpox but provides only presumptive evidence of the disease in the appropriate clinical context.

Because rickettsiae and rickettsial antigens  are  typically distributed in great abundance in the inoculation eschar, 26,27 polymerase chain reaction ampli{cation of rickettsial nucleic acids from swab or tissue biopsy samples of this lesion represent the most sensitive and  speci{c  method  of  con{rming  rickettsialpox.  Nonetheless, the reference standard for microbiological con{rmation of rickettsialpox is cultivation of R. akari in cell culture. A punch biopsy specimen obtained from the central aspect of the lesion provides the ideal specimen to inoculate cell cultures for attempted isolation of R.  akari . 22 R.  akari will  grow  in  several  standard  cell  lines, including Vero E6 and L929 cells.

TREATMENT
Tetracyclines, particularly doxycycline, remain the drugs of choice for  the  treatment  of  rickettsialpox.  In  two  contemporary  case series documenting antibiotic responses in 28 patients who received tetracycline or doxycycline treatment for rickettsialpox, fever and other  systemic  symptoms  resolved  in  most  patients  within  24 hours and all patients became asymptomatic within 48 hours. 6,7 The standard oral dose of doxycycline is 100 mg every 12 hours, continued for at least 3 days after complete resolution of fever, with a  minimum treatment course of 5 days. Despite concerns regarding  tooth  staining  and  enamel  hypoplasia  after  use  of tetracycline-class  antibiotics  in  children  younger  than  8  years of age, recent studies indicate that a short (e.g., 5 days) course of therapy with doxycycline does not cause tooth staining or enamel hypoplasia in the permanent teeth of children who receive this antibiotic before the age of 8 years. 28 Chloramphenicol, given at a  dosage of 12.5 mg/kg every 6 hours for 5 to 10 days, can be used as alternate therapy in those patients for whom there is an absolute contraindication for receiving doxycycline; nonetheless, chloramphenicol is no longer available in  the oral  form  in the United States, and the intravenous form is not readily available at all institutions. 29 Most Rickettsia species, including R. akari, are highly susceptible to rifampin in vitro, 30 and this antibiotic has been  used  rarely,  albeit  successfully,  to  treat  some  rickettsial infections in patients with doxycycline intolerance, at a dose of 450 mg twice a day for 10 days. 31 However, there are no clinical data describing the ef{cacy of rifampin in patients with rickettsialpox, and this antibiotic should be considered an alternative to doxycycline only for specialized situations.

PREVENTION AND CONTROL
There  is  no  vaccine  against  rickettsialpox.  Prevention  depends principally on effective control of house mice in human dwellings and workplaces. Thorough vacuuming and dusting with diatomaceous  earth  of  mite-infested  areas  can  eliminate  some  mites; however, rodent elimination should always be coupled with acaricide treatments to mouse nests and runways, as well as walls and ceilings of infested premises. 32 There are no data regarding sensitivity of L. sanguineus to contemporary acaricides; nonetheless, pyrethrin and pyrethroid sprays and dusts are used effectively against other related and commonly encountered parasitic mite species. 33
