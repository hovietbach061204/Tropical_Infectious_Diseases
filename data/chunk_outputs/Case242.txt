Swedish cohort, the lifetime prevalence of delusional disorders was estimated at 0.30 per 100 population [2].
Rates of DP are difficult to determine. Since patients with DP generally refuse psychiatric help, the true incidence and prevalence of this disorder may be greatly underestimated in the psychiatric literature. In southwest Germany, the incidence and prevalence of DP were estimated  to  be  16.6  and  83.2  cases  per  million  population  per  year, respectively [3]. In his 1995 review, Trabert [4] had identified a total of 1223 cases in the literature; as of 2008, reports of over 1400 cases were published [5]. Most have been reported from North America and Europe, and recently from most other areas of the world except Africa.
While DP affects adults of all ages, it is much more common in older age groups ( > 50 years). In Trabert's review, the mean age of onset was 57 years and 84% of patients were over age 50, with men presenting at a slightly younger age than women [4]. Overall, women outnumber men by a 2-3 : 1 ratio [4,6]. Although the sex distribution is almost equal in early adulthood, the female  :  male ratio exceeds 3  :  1 in individuals over 50 years of age [4,6].
Patients can be from any socioeconomic background. Many are single and may be considered 'loners'. A higher than expected prevalence of personality disorders has been observed in some case series [6,7]. However,  many  affected  individuals  are  both  educated  and  highly functional; in Lyell's survey [6], several of the 282 patients described were professionals, including physicians and psychologists.

NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
In  its  truest  form,  DP  is  a  delusional  disorder  of  the  somatic  type: 'delusions that the person has some physical defect of general medical condition'  [8].  Munro  [9]  first  suggested  that  DP  was  a  form  of monosymptomatic  hypochondriasis  or  monosymptomatic  hypochondriacal psychosis (MHP), a fixed, single hypochondriacal belief that exists when no other thought disorder is present. Delusions of parasitosis are the most common form of MHP.
The  pathophysiology  of  somatic  delusional  disorders  is  unknown. Some  have  theorized  that  abnormal  sensations  experienced  by patients ( as if something was crawling on the skin) lead to the conviction that parasites are present (that something really is crawling on the skin). An incident during which exposure to parasites might have occurred, such as sleeping in unclean bedsheets, borrowing another's clothing, or travel to an exotic destination, may be a trigger for DP. In some, newly acquired knowledge or awareness of a disease (through heightened  public  health  or  media  interest,  or  the  internet,  for example) can amplify and perpetuate new or pre-existing symptoms; reasons for this symptom amplification are unclear. Stress can also exacerbate somatic complaints, and the stress induced by the severity of the perceived illness may augment symptoms further.
It  has  also  been  suggested  that  DP  may  be  due  to  central  nervous system abnormalities. Response of many  patients to the dopamine

INTRODUCTION
Delusional parasitosis (DP), first described in 1894, is a disorder in which affected individuals have a delusion - an unshakeable belief - that they are infected by 'bugs': parasites, worms, bacteria, mites, or other living organisms, associated with abnormal cutaneous sensations. While the disease remains rare, there is increasing awareness of and  advancement  in  the  pharmacologic  therapy  of  DP.  However, recognition  and  management  of  this  problem  continues  to  be challenging.

antagonist pimozide supports the theory that DP results from excess extracellular dopamine within the striatum of the brain [10]. In some patients,  structural  abnormalities  in  the  basal  ganglia,  in  particular the putamen and caudate nucleus, have been documented [11,12]; most of these patients also responded favorably to dopamine antagonists. Such findings must be interpreted with caution, however, given the small number of patients studied and the lack of comparison with age-matched normal controls.

CLASSIFICATION OF DELUSIONAL PARASITOSIS
No definite classification of DP exists. Broadly speaking, three different forms can be described.

============================================================
CHUNK 7
============================================================
PRIMARY DELUSIONAL PARASITOSIS
Primary  DP is  a  somatic  delusional  disorder  (Box  153.1).  Patients with  delusional  disorders  do  not  meet  the  diagnostic  criteria  for schizophrenia or other psychiatric disorders.  Specifically,  hallucinations, disorganized speech, schizophrenic behavior, and other 'negative' symptoms are absent, although hallucinations that are secondary to the delusional theme (i.e. tactile hallucinations) may be present. Similarly, anxiety or depression secondary to  the delusional disorder may be present.

CHUNK 8
============================================================
SECONDARY DELUSIONAL PARASITOSIS ASSOCIATED WITH UNDERLYING PSYCHIATRIC DISEASE
Delusions  of  parasitosis  may  be  a  manifestation  of  an  underlying psychiatric illness, such as schizophrenia, anxiety, depression, obsessive  compulsive disorder, schizophreniform disorder, bipolar disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder. It is essential to distinguish this form of DP from primary DP as the management differs, but this may be challenging, particularly for the non-psychiatrist physician who is most likely to encounter such patients.

SECONDARY DELUSIONAL PARASITOSIS ASSOCIATED WITH UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITIONS
Although up to 25% of cases of DP have been attributed to underlying medical conditions [4,7], in our experience this is remarkably rare. Delusional parasitosis has been attributed to diseases of most organ systems, most commonly the central nervous system (Table 153-1). Substance abuse should be considered, especially when DP presents in  younger  age  groups.  Numerous  prescription  medications  have been  implicated  in  DP;  in  such  cases,  symptoms  generally  resolve

CLINICAL FEATURES
Patients with DP have unfounded, irrational beliefs of infestation that cannot be corrected by reasoning, persuasion or logic. Symptoms and beliefs are variable, ranging from a non-disruptive feeling of infestation to delusions that may interfere with daily activities. Patients with primary DP generally have intact mental function, lack other manifestations of psychiatric disease, and have otherwise normal behavior. Their delusions are limited in scope and usually do not interfere with personal and professional aspects of their lives. Although they initially cannot appreciate their delusional state, it may subsequently become evident to them during therapy. Patients with secondary DP may have signs and symptoms of underlying disease. Younger patients are more likely to have DP associated with head injuries, substance abuse and schizophrenia, and are more likely to be involved in shared delusions [6,13]. Delusions due to substance abuse are usually transient and of inadequate duration to meet the criteria for delusional disorder.
Longstanding  dermatologic  complaints  are  common,  including rashes, pruritus, and sensations of stinging, biting and formication.

============================================================
CHUNK 11
============================================================
CLINICAL FEATURES
Most patients have chronic symptoms, at least 6 months in duration and often longer, before the diagnosis is established. The median and average duration of symptoms before diagnosis in Trabert's study was 1  year  and  3  years,  respectively  [4].  Patients  may  have  received repeated courses of dermatologic and antiparasitic therapies despite the lack of an objective diagnosis. They frequently bring in specimens for examination which they have picked from their skin - the 'matchbox'  or  'Ziploc®  bag'  sign  [14,15]  -  and  which  typically  contain normal  skin  flakes  or  dust,  hair,  or  occasionally  parts  of  nonpathogenic  insects.  Patients  may  produce  bizarre  and  exhaustive descriptions  and  diagrams  of  the  parasites  and  their  reproductive cycles.  Patients  who  attribute  their  disease  to  household  pets  may have visited veterinarians repeatedly, seeking treatment for their pets. Consultation with pest-control services and exterminators, and use of potentially toxic pesticides (on themselves and their belongings), may be attempted. Those driven to extremes may move, or rid themselves of their belongings. For some, fear of transmission of their 'infection' to others may cause them to be socially isolated, even from family members. Recently, as a result of web searches, some believe that they have 'Morgellons disease', an unexplained condition characterized by diverse cutaneous symptoms, foreign material (e.g. fibers) on the skin, and skin lesions.
Others, particularly family members, may occasionally be drawn into the patient's delusional system, usually  by a woman [16]. Between 8% and 25% of delusions of parasitosis are  shared [6,7,16],  most often with one other person (folie à deux), usually a partner or spouse (less commonly offspring). On occasion, trios (folie à trois), or even larger groups, may be involved.

PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Delusional  parasitosis  should  be  suspected  when  an  individual presents with an irrational, fixed belief that he or she is infected with internal or external parasites in spite of reassurance and ample evidence to the contrary. It is important to determine the following: 1) is  the  belief  founded in reality, and the patient truly infected; 2) if infection can  be excluded,  is  the patient  truly  delusional,  or  is  the patient  hypochondriacal  and  the  belief  'shakeable';  and  3)  if  the patient is delusional, what form of DP is present? The optimal therapy differs  depending  on the answers  to  these  questions.  If  an  organic cause  can  be  ruled  out,  the  major  challenge  is  then  to  determine whether the patient is suffering from a primary delusional disorder or has an underlying psychiatric illness. A psychiatric opinion is invaluable  in  such  instances,  but  most  patients  with  DP  will  refuse  a psychiatric assessment.
The initial assessment(s) should focus on the patient's primary complaints, eliminating both true infection and an organic disease(s) as causes of their symptoms. A thorough history to elicit symptoms of underlying disease, and use of prescription and illicit drugs, should be obtained; important clues about underlying medical or psychiatric illness can be discovered by thorough careful questioning and listening. A complete physical examination is essential, looking for findings of underlying conditions and paying particular attention to the skin, since  most  patients  have  cutaneous  symptoms.  Ulcers,  scratches, denuded skin and scars may be present from attempts to remove the organisms from the skin by using fingernails, knives, pins, duct-tape or other objects. Lesions are often absent in the upper back where the patient cannot reach. Contact or irritant dermatitis may be present from excessive cleaning or the use of abrasive soaps or chemicals.
Evaluation  by  a  dermatologist  can  be  beneficial  and  may  reassure the patient that  his/her  symptoms  are being taken  seriously.  If the patient has brought his/her own specimens, reassure the patient that these  will  be  sent  to  a  proper  laboratory  and/or  entomologist  for examination. The patient should be provided with specimen bottles containing  preservative  to  collect  additional  specimens,  thereby reducing the chance that parasites will be missed because of improper collection and reassuring the patient that you 'believe' him/her. Skin biopsies are rarely required. Negative results, especially from repeated

- Drug and toxin screen
- Serology for HIV infection and syphilis
- Tuberculin skin test
- Additional radiologic imaging (e.g. computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain)
examinations of submitted specimens, can eliminate the possibility of a real parasitic infection. Appropriate initial investigations should be obtained (Box 153.2).
Follow-up visits fulfill multiple needs. In addition to providing more opportunity for the patient to develop trust in the physician, serial examination of skin lesions during repeat visits can be performed and additional specimens (or other investigations) obtained as required. Repeated assessments may also be helpful in determining whether the patient  has  a  shakeable  belief  (hypochondriasis)  rather  than  true delusions, if this remains unclear. Since most patients will not agree to psychiatric care, long-term follow-up with the primary care physician may be most appropriate.

============================================================
CHUNK 15
============================================================
PSYCHIATRIC ASSESSMENT
Secondary DP associated with underlying psychiatric disorders is best managed by a psychiatrist. Some suggest that most patients with DP should be managed by primary care physicians, dermatologists, or infectious disease consultants for fear of losing them to medical care altogether by suggesting they see a psychiatrist, while others recommend that a psychiatrist be at least consulted at some point in the patient's care. However, many healthcare practitioners are not trained or  prepared  to  provide  the  pharmacotherapy  that  can  benefit  the patient with DP.
Convincing patients with DP of the  need for and importance of a psychiatric referral is extremely difficult. The treating physician's credibility  often  dissipates  and  trust  is lost  at  the  mere  mention  of  the need for psychiatric consultation or therapy; there is a significant risk of losing the patient altogether. Gradual introduction of the topic over the course of several visits, emphasizing the need for expert guidance to manage the effects that DP has had on the patient's life (such as stress or depression) may result in greater success. In some situations it may be helpful to discuss the case with a psychiatrist prior to commencing therapy.

============================================================
CHUNK 16
============================================================
TREATMENT
Psychotherapy,  psychosurgery,  and  electroconvulsive  therapy  have met with little success  in  the  treatment  of  DP,  with  low  cure  rates comparable to the rate of spontaneous resolution (17). Antidepressant and anxiolytic medications may improve secondary mood disorders but generally have no role in the treatment of primary DP.
A strong therapeutic relationship with the patient is critical. A sympathetic,  non-judgmental  approach,  acknowledgment  that  patients' symptoms are real (and, if necessary that they are not mentally ill), and empathetic exploration into the effects their symptoms have had on their daily lives can instill a sense of trust into the relationship. A conservative,  non-confrontational  approach  is  recommended  [1719]. Use of phrases such as 'I cannot see any parasites today' rather than  'There  are  no  parasites'  [6],  and  acknowledgment  that  their problem may have resulted from a previous infection may accomplish this, while further gaining the patient's trust. It is  important not to dismiss  patients'  complaints  as  trivial,  even  when  they  are  clearly delusional, but equally important not to openly support their beliefs and feed into their delusional system. Reassurance that they can be helped is also valuable.

============================================================
CHUNK 17
============================================================
TREATMENT
In spite of the limited evidence of their efficacy, with few clinical trials and no substantial randomized controlled trials conducted, antipsychotic medications have become the mainstay of therapy for DP [20]. The goal of therapy should be improvement in the patient's symptoms, and not necessarily cure. Convincing patients to take antipsychotic  agents  poses  another  significant  obstacle,  however.  Even  if patients do agree to start medication, adherence may be an issue. How does one convince psychotic patients who steadfastly believe that they are not psychotic to take antipsychotics? One strategy that we have used  with  considerable  success  is  the  approach  that 'the  parasitic infection'  is  no  longer  present,  but  symptoms  continue  as  a  result  of  a 'biochemical imbalance' resulting from the initial infestation . Introducing the  need  for  an  antipsychotic  is  accomplished  by  indicating  that although the drug was originally designed for schizophrenia ( 'but of course, you are not schizophrenic') , it is being used for another purpose, i.e. to rebalance body chemistry. This statement should be followed by examples of other medications that have more than one use, such as aspirin for pyrexia and coronary artery disease, or amitriptyline for depression and neuritis. Patients are much more likely to agree to take medication for treatment of a 'chemical imbalance' than for a psychiatric  problem. Some patients may be persuaded if they are told that patients with a similar condition have experienced great relief in their symptoms using similar medications. Bargaining with a patient is fraught with potential problems; however, the physician may agree to  a  patient's  request  (for  example,  treatment  with  an  antiparasitic agent) on the condition that the patient also begin an antipsychotic medication.
Efficacy comparisons of different agents are hindered by publication bias,  the  paucity  of  controlled trials,  the  inclusion  of  patients  with both  primary  and  secondary  DP  in  many  studies,  and  the  lack  of standardized criteria for assessing response to therapy.

============================================================
CHUNK 18
============================================================
First-Generation Antipsychotic Agents
While many first-generation antipsychotics have been used successfully  for  treatment  of  DP,  pimozide  has  been  the  most  extensively studied, with the highest reported success rate. Case series from the late 1990s reported response rates of up to 87% (33% to 52% complete, 28% to 35% partial) [21,22], and two small double-blind trials both demonstrated efficacy of greater than 90% [23,24].
Pimozide selectively blocks dopamine type 2 receptors. It has minimal effect on other central nervous system neurotransmitters, although its antagonistic effects on opiate receptors may also reduce sensations of pruritus and formication [23]. The most common adverse effects are extrapyramidal reactions (tremor, bradykinesia, shuffling gait), which occur in up to 15% of patients [13].
Doses between 1 and 12 mg daily are usually effective for treatment of DP. An initial dose of 0.5 to 1 mg daily can be increased gradually (e.g. by 1 mg weekly) either to the maximum daily dose of 20 mg, or until  the  desired clinical  effect  has  been  achieved, which may  take several weeks. Most patients respond to doses much lower than 10 mg per day. Once a satisfactory response has been obtained, the patient should be maintained on the same dose for several months, and the dose can then be tapered gradually (by 1 mg every 1 to 2 weeks) until the drug is discontinued [13,25]. If relapses occur, they often respond
to re-institution of the drug. Some patients will require prolonged or indefinite therapy in order to control their symptoms.

============================================================
CHUNK 19
============================================================
Second-Generation Antipsychotic (SGA) Agents
Many psychiatrists today would choose a newer atypical antipsychotic over  pimozide,  particularly  in  the  elderly  and  those  with  known cardiac disease, because of the better safety profile, greater tolerability, and  more  specific  actions.  In  a  recent  retrospective  case  series  of patients with primary and secondary DP treated with various SGAs, partial  or  full  remission  was  achieved  in  37%  and  38%  of  63 cases,  respectively,  and  overall,  SGAs  were  felt  to  be  as  effective  as traditional first-generation drugs, albeit with a lower rate of complete remission [26].
Risperidone is considered by some to be the first-line therapy for DP. Risperidone  has  been  effective  for  some  patients  who  have  failed therapy  with  pimozide  [26,27].  Risperidone  preferentially  blocks serotonin  receptors  while  still  maintaining  some  activity  against dopamine receptors. Between 0.25 and 8 mg daily, administered in one or two doses, are required for clinical response, although most patients require 2-4 mg [26]. Adverse effects, including extrapyramidal reactions, can occur. A possible increased risk of cerebrovascular accidents in dementia patients receiving risperidone [28] has not been reported in patients with delusional disorders.
Olanzapine at doses of 2.5 to 20 mg daily also appears to be effective, but its  use  has been  reported less frequently [26]. Success has also been reported with many other SGAs.

CHUNK 20
============================================================
OUTCOME AND PROGNOSIS
Delusional parasitosis was previously considered a progressive disorder with only a 10% to 30% chance of spontaneous remission [1 1,17]. Antipsychotic therapy has resulted in markedly improved outcomes.
Prognostic factors include the type of DP (primary versus secondary), duration of illness prior to therapy, and the duration of therapy. In patients  treated  with  SGAs,  the  time  to  onset  of  any  effect  and  to maximal effect was shorter, and response rates higher (80% versus 68%) in secondary DP compared with primary DP, but these differences  were  not  statistically  significant  [26].  Maximum  effects  of therapy were generally noted by 10 weeks in responders, suggesting that a lack of response by this time should prompt a change in treatment. The duration of symptoms may also affect outcome. In Trabert's study [4], the likelihood of a full remission was inversely correlated with the duration of symptoms, although this was not observed in patients treated with SGAs [26]. Sustained therapy of at least 8 weeks' duration  and  treatment  supervision  by  a  psychiatrist  may  also  be associated with improved response rates [26]. Relapse rates are difficult to determine; they appear to be common and tend to respond well to re-institution of therapy, regardless of the antipsychotic agent used [6,15].
