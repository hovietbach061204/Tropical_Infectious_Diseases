KEY FEATURES
- similar diseases.
- human-adapted viruses to emerging highly pathogenic viruses from animal reservoirs with pandemic threat.
- respiratory tract infection with systemic dissemination.
- children, the elderly, and the immunocompromised are more at risk for severe disease (during the H1N1pdm09 in|uenza pandemic, pregnant women and young adults were especially at risk, whereas the annual avian H7N9 outbreaks in China and MERS-CoV mostly affect the elderly).

INTRODUCTION
Acute respiratory illnesses are the most frequently occurring illness in all age groups globally. Disease is mostly limited to the upper airways and is self-limiting, but a small percentage can progress to lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) as bronchiolitis and pneumonia.  Children  and  elderly  people  are  at  increased  risk, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
Childhood  pneumonia  is  the  leading  cause  of  mortality  in children under 5 and has an incidence of 0.29 episodes per childyear in LMICs and 0.05 in high-income countries. This translates into 156 million new episodes annually worldwide, of which 151 million are in LMICs. Pneumonia killed 920,136 children under 5 in 2015, accounting for 16% of all deaths of children under 5. On the other side of the age spectrum, pneumonia is also a major cause of morbidity and mortality in older people, with an annual incidence for non-institutionalized patients at 25 to 44 per 1000, up to four times that of patients under 65.
The most important etiologic agents of severe LRTI are bacteria such as Streptococcus  pneumoniae and Haemophilus  inRuenzae and viruses  such  as  respiratory  syncytial  virus  (RSV)  and  in|uenza virus. Ef{cacious vaccines are available against the two bacteria and the in|uenza virus. Viruses are more important in mild upper and middle respiratory tract infections (RTIs) and in bronchiolitis in children, whereas bacteria are the main cause of pneumonia, especially in adults. Despite this, RTIs-because of the dif{culty of  making  a  rapid  diagnosis  of  the  etiologic  agent-are  often treated  with  antibiotics  and  are  responsible  for  a  large  part  of inappropriate and appropriate use of antibiotics in humans. Clinical syndromes overlap considerably, and there is increasing evidence of bacterial-viral co-infections and of bacterial pneumonia being secondary to viral RTI. 1-6

ETIOLOGY
A range of different viruses can cause RTIs; the most important are the ortho- and paramyxoviridae, picornaviridae, coronaviruses, and adenoviruses. Although it is generally accepted that the majority of mild RTIs are viral, recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the published literature showed that in adults, 25% of patients with community-acquired pneumonia was viral. This percentage is  higher  in  children,  particularly  children  under  5,  due  to  the large proportion of cases caused by RSV . In adults, the contributions of identi{ed viral etiologies were 8% for in|uenza viruses, 6% for rhinoviruses, 3% for coronaviruses, and 2% for RSV . In children under 5 with LRTIs, strong causal associations for RSV , in|uenza viruses, parain|uenza viruses, and metapneumovirus were found in comparison with healthy controls, and less so for adenoviruses, bocaviruses, and coronaviruses. 7,8

Orthomyxoviridae: Influenza Viruses
Orthomyxoviridae are divided into four genera: A-D. In|uenza A viruses are further subtyped based on the two major antigens: haemagglutinin (HA; H1-H18) and neuraminidase (NA; N1-N11), that are responsible for host receptor binding/cell entry and cell exit, respectively. Key amino acids in these proteins, especially in HA, are  associated  with  host  speci{city  and  transmissibility  in humans. Aquatic  birds  are  the  natural  reservoir  of  in|uenza  A viruses, harboring all possible subtypes, except H17, H18, N10, and N11. These were recently identi{ed in bats, suggesting birds are not the only reservoir. A selection of subtypes has established endemicity among land and water mammals (e.g., humans, pigs, horses,  seals;  Fig.  33.1).  In|uenza  B  and  C  viruses  are  mainly human pathogens, with rare reports of in|uenza B virus infection in dogs, cats, swine, and seals. In|uenza C rarely causes human infections, and in|uenza D viruses mostly infect cattle and will not be further discussed.
Yearly epidemics of in|uenza are caused by in|uenza A and B viruses with mutations in the regions of the HA and NA genes that  encode  antigenicity,  allowing  them  to  escape  the  hosts' immunity against parent strains (antigenic drift).

============================================================
CHUNK 6
============================================================
Orthomyxoviridae: Influenza Viruses
New lineages of in|uenza A virus emerge every few decades, resulting  in  global  pandemics  with  varying  severity  due  to  the absence of immunity in the human population. New human viruses have emerged through antigenic drift in avian viruses (1918 Spanish |u: H1N1, 40-100 million deaths) or through reassortment of gene segments in animal hosts infected with two different viruses (antigenic  shift;  1957 Asian  |u:  H2N2,  2  million  deaths;  1968 Hong Kong |u: H3N2, 500,000 deaths). After such an introduction,  the  new  virus  becomes  the  dominant  circulating  lineage. Two notable exceptions were the reintroduction of H1N1 in the human population in  1977, possibly caused  by  an escape  from a  research  laboratory,  and  the  introduction  in  2009  of  a  novel lineage of H1N1 in|uenza A virus, most likely from pigs, in North America, causing a relatively mild pandemic (with an estimated 100,000-400,000 deaths) and generating massive attention from both the public health communities and the general public and replacing only the 1977 H1N1 lineage. Currently, H1N1pdm09 and H3N2 in|uenza A virus are co-circulating with in|uenza B viruses and continue to cause yearly seasonal epidemics worldwide. The timing, extent, and direction of either 'drift' or 'shift' have so far been completely unpredictable. With no animal reservoirs to provide such new antigens, shift does not occur in in|uenza B and thus major epidemics do not occur (Fig. 33.2). 1,2
Sporadic dead-end human infections of animal viruses are known to occur and have caused concern about the pandemic potential of  these  viruses.  Swine  H3N2, H1N1, and H1N2 viruses have

Fig. 33.1 The reservoir of influenza A viruses. The working hypothesis is that wild aquatic birds are the primordial reservoir of all influenza viruses for avian and mammalian species. Transmission of influenza has been demonstrated between pigs and humans (solid lines). There is extensive evidence for transmission between aquatic birds and other species, including pigs and horses, and indirect transmission to humans through pigs and evidence for direct transmission to humans from chickens.

caused  infections  in  humans  with  limited  human-to-human transmission. H6N1, H7N7, H7N3, H9N2, and H10N7 viruses have caused conjunctivitis and mild |ulike illness in patients in close contact with infected birds or seals.
In contrast, H5N1 avian in|uenza viruses have caused severe human respiratory illness in Asia and North Africa, with a mortality of over 50%. Highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses were {rst detected in birds in 1996 in China. T ransmission to 18 humans occurred in Hong Kong, 6 of which were fatal. During the next 6 years no human or animal cases were recorded. In 2003 the virus reemerged in China. Since then H5N1 viruses have become panzootic among poultry and wild birds and have caused 860 sporadic infections (454 fatal) in humans until 2015, most of whom reported close contact with wild birds or domestic poultry.
Furthermore, a total of 1566 cases (including 613 deaths) of human infection with avian in|uenza H7N9 have been reported from China, occurring in annual outbreaks between December and February since 2013. Human H7N9 infection is also zoonotic,
Fig. 33.2 Timeline of circulating subtypes of influenza A virus from 1918 onwards. In 1977, H1N1 was re-introduced and has since co-circulated with H3N2. In 2009, a new H1N1 lineage (pdm09) was introduced, which has replaced the former H1N1 subtype.

with no reported sustained human-to-human transmission, and mostly associated with exposure to live bird markets. Interestingly, human cases have been con{ned to parts of mainland China, and avian infection is limited to domestic poultry with little spillover to migratory birds and wild waterfowl. The case fatality of H7N9 is lower than H5N1, and associations with age and comorbidities are reported. 9-12
Despite their worldwide presence for many years and the huge human-animal  interface  in Asia,  no  ef{cient  human-to-human transmission episodes  have  been  recorded  for  either.  However, the continuous evolution and reassortment in these viruses (e.g., H5N8 viruses  have  spread  globally  within  a  few  years  among birds,  without  human  cases,  and  H5N6  has  become  dominant among birds in parts of Asia and infected 19 humans in China, 6 of whom died) remains a cause for concern and warrants continuous monitoring and surveillance of these viruses in domestic poultry and wild birds. 6

============================================================
CHUNK 9
============================================================
Paramyxoviridae: Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Parainfluenza Virus 1-4, Human Metapneumovirus
These six human viruses are the most important causes of LRTIs in children worldwide. RSV is the single most important cause of bronchiolitis and the leading cause of RTIs requiring hospitalization. Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) causes similar disease but less frequently, whereas the parain|uenza viruses are associated with bronchiolitis and croup. A recent study estimated that RSV caused 3.2  million  hospitalizations  and  59,600  deaths  among  children under 5, and 118,200 deaths among all age groups, annually. 13
Infections are very common, and virtually all children will have been infected with RSV by 2 years of age and by hMPV at 5 years of age. Immunity is incomplete, although reinfections tend to be milder. Severe disease is common from RSV and hMPV in the {rst year of life. Reinfection with RSV or parain|uenza viruses is  also  a  common  cause of pneumonia in elderly and immunocompromised patients.
Other paramyxoviridae such as rubeola virus (measles) or the zoonotic Nipah virus are also associated with respiratory disease as part of disseminated infection. These are discussed in separate chapters.

============================================================
CHUNK 10
============================================================
Coronaviruses
The four main human respiratory coronaviruses (229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1) are associated with relatively mild upper RTIs and  may cause  10%  to 25%  of episodes of common  colds but are  less  frequently  implicated  in  severe  infections  requiring hospitalization.
In 2002-2003 a novel severe form of pneumonia of unknown acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). After smoldering for several months, the disease then spread rapidly across the world, facilitated by international air travel and a few so-called super-spreaders, with most  notable  outbreaks  in  Hong  Kong  and  T oronto,  Canada. Twenty-one percent of affected cases were health care workers.
The culprit, SARS coronavirus, is thought to have jumped to a delicacy in parts of Asia, in these markets were found to harbor the virus. Wild civet cats, however, do not carry these viruses, and instead  certain  bat  species  have  been  implicated  as  the  natural reservoir.
The epidemic of SARS, with 8096 cases and 744 deaths in 29 countries across 5 continents, started in November 2002 and came to an end in July 2003. Few sporadic community- and laboratoryacquired infections, including limited person-to-person transmission, have been recorded since then.
SARS was characterized by fever and myalgia rapidly progressing to a respiratory syndrome of cough and dyspnea followed by acute respiratory distress syndrome. Mortality was signi{cantly lower in children.
SARS is primarily spread by the respiratory route, but oral-fecal transmission has also been implicated. Why the SARS epidemic did not continue to spread is subject to much speculation. Explanations include the fact that SARS is most infectious in a later stage of infection, allowing for timely containment, and an extraordinary worldwide effort to control spread. 14,15

============================================================
Coronaviruses
A  decade  later,  another  novel  coronavirus  was  found  to  be associated with acute severe pneumonia in countries in the Middle East. The virus, called Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, has since caused > 2100 infections, 750 of which were fatal, in 27 countries. Most cases originated from countries in the Arabian  peninsula  with  rare  travel-related  spillovers,  including one that  caused  a  large  health  care  facility-related  outbreak  in South  Korea  in  2015.  More  mild  and  asymptomatic  cases  are observed with MERS, and mortality is strongly associated with age and co-morbidities. The natural reservoir of MERS coronavirus is dromedary camels, and in Saudi Arabia half of cases are classi{ed as  primary,  often  associated  with  collection,  preparation,  and ingestion of milk or meat. The other half results from humanto-human transmission, often associated with health care facilities. Control of MERS coronavirus is dif{cult because of the stable natural reservoir and the presence of asymptomatic human spreaders. Vaccination of dromedary camels was proposed as an ef{cient intervention,  but  unfortunately  neutralizing  antibodies  do  not appear to protect against infection or viral shedding. 6,16

============================================================
Picornaviruses: Enteroviruses and Parechoviruses
Picornaviruses are the most common cause of infectious illness in  humans. The more than 100 serotypes of rhinovirus species A-C  (now  classi{ed  as  enteroviruses)  are  the  most  important causative agent of the common cold. Infections are usually mild and con{ned to the upper respiratory tract but may be associated with exacerbations of asthma and chronic bronchitis.
The  more  than  100  serotypes  of  enterovirus  species  A-D (Coxsackie A and B viruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses) are mainly transmitted by the oral-fecal route and to a much lesser extent by respiratory droplets. Enteroviruses are a major cause of aseptic meningitis in children and adults but are also associated with  the  common  cold,  herpangina,  and  acute  hemorrhagic conjunctivitis. Enterovirus D68 behaves more like a rhinovirus, as it replicates in the respiratory rather than the gastrointestinal tract and has caused a worldwide outbreak of relatively mild RTI in  2012-2014,  but  with  epidemiologic  links  to  acute  |accid paralysis.
Similarly, parechoviruses are another common cause of aseptic meningitis but  are  also  implicated  as  frequent  causes  of  (mild) respiratory illness.

============================================================
CHUNK 13
============================================================
Adenoviruses
Adenoviruses are a frequent cause of epidemic infective conjunctivitis  in  LMICs  and  of  RTIs  in  children  and  young  adults worldwide.  Outbreaks  of  adenoviral  respiratory  infections  can occur in closed communities such as daycare centers, boarding schools, and among military recruits. Most adenoviral infections remain subclinical. T wo adenovirus serotypes are associated with gastroenteritis and diarrhea (serotypes 40 and 41).

============================================================
CHUNK 14
============================================================
EPIDEMIOLOGY
With the exceptions noted earlier,  most respiratory viruses  are spread from person to person by the respiratory route, to a varying extent by large droplets, small-particle aerosols, and fomites with hand contamination and subsequent self-inoculation. Patients are most infectious  early  in  the  disease  or  even  before.  Secondary attack  rates  may  be  especially  high  in  semi-closed  populations, like  schoolchildren,  inpatients,  and  nursing  home  residents. Children play a major role in respiratory virus outbreaks among families and communities. Frequent handwashing and covering of the mouth when coughing or sneezing may partially prevent transmission.
Many  of  the  viruses  display  signi{cant  seasonal  variation, especially in temperate regions. In|uenza virus and RSV epidemics occur in the winter months in temperate regions. In tropical areas seasonal patterns are less clear: viruses may circulate throughout the year, and peaks may coincide with lower temperatures, humidity, or rainfall.

============================================================
CHUNK 15
============================================================
CLINICAL SYNDROMES AND PATHOGENESIS
Acute RTIs usually start in the upper respiratory tract, as the port of entry is the nose, mouth, or eyes. Spread to the lower parts of the airways occurs within 2 to 4 days. Syndromes overlap considerably; are usually accompanied by symptoms such as fever, cough, and malaise; and can be caused by any of the pathogens described earlier.
Particularly  in  LMICs,  crowding  of  large  families  in  small houses, low levels of sanitation and personal hygiene, indoor and outdoor  smoke  pollution,  malnutrition,  vitamin  and  mineral de{ciencies, and a high frequency of RTIs may have detrimental effects  on  the  integrity  of  the  respiratory  mucosa,  respiratory function, and the immune status, making the patient more prone to  repeated  and  more  severe  viral  infection  and  to  secondary bacterial infection. Old and very young age, including prematurity, are additional risk factors for a more severe course.

============================================================
CHUNK 16
============================================================
Common Cold
The common cold, or coryza, is the most frequent disease worldwide. Speci{c symptoms include runny or stuffed nose, sneezing, and sore throat. Symptoms are caused by local infection of the ciliated nasal mucosal epithelium cells and surrounding increased vascular permeability. The disease is usually self-limiting.

============================================================
CHUNK 17
============================================================
Pharyngitis
Sore throat often accompanies the common cold but is typically not the result of in|ammation of the throat, but rather caused by excretion of chemical in|ammation mediators that stimulate pain nerve endings. Bacteria are a common cause of true pharyngitis, as are enteroviruses, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV).

============================================================
CHUNK 18
============================================================
Acute Laryngotracheobronchitis (Croup)
Croup  affects  children  under  3;  the  hallmark  symptoms  are  a barking cough and acute inspiratory stridor. Symptoms are caused by localized subglottic in|ammation and edema leading to air|ow impediment.

============================================================
CHUNK 19
============================================================
Tracheitis and Tracheobronchitis
These  are  most  often  caused  by  infection  of  the  tracheal  and bronchial epithelium and are characterized by tracheal tenderness, substernal discomfort on inhalation, and non-productive cough.

============================================================
CHUNK 20
============================================================
Bronchiolitis
Bronchiolitis is a distinct syndrome of infants and young children. The major symptom is wheezing, accompanied by |aring of the nostrils, use of accessory respiratory muscles, and cyanosis in more severe cases. Direct viral infection of the bronchiolar epithelial cells followed by increased mucus secretion results in the formation of dense plugs of debris that cause impediment of expiratory air|ow. Children  may  experience  repeated  episodes  of  wheezing  after recovery. Associations with development of asthma and a causative role of the immune system in pathogenesis have been suggested.

============================================================
CHUNK 21
============================================================
Viral Pneumonia
Development of primary viral pneumonia is de{ned by dysfunctional  gas  exchange  accompanying  in|ammation  of  the  lung parenchyma, usually resulting in radiographic changes. There is acute generalized illness and a dry cough; rhinitis and conjunctivitis may be present. An increased respiratory rate is an early feature, with cyanosis developing in very severe disease. Viruses reach the small airways either through continuous spread or by inhalation of aerosols.  Mucosal infection leads to destruction of epithelial cells, submucosal hyperemia, edema of the airways, and hemorrhaging. Additional cellular in{ltration and {brin depositions may further compromise respiratory volume and gas exchange surface.
Viral pneumonia can be part of severe forms of measles and varicella,  and  may  be  secondary  to  generalized  infections  with EBV or CMV. In infections with New World hantaviruses, pulmonary  symptoms  are  dominant  but  are  instead  caused  by immune-mediated capillary leak.
Secondary  bacterial  pneumonia  may  follow  any  respiratory viral illness and presents as a recurrent or protracted fever and respiratory  symptoms  after  initial  recovery. S.  pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus are common causes.

============================================================
CHUNK 22
============================================================
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical  history  and  examination  may  give  important  clues  in establishing  the  speci{c  viral  diagnosis,  but  syndromes  overlap and are non-speci{c. Etiologic diagnosis can only reliably be made by detection of virus, antigens, or nucleic acids in respiratory or other specimens, or retrospectively by demonstrating an immune response in paired serum samples.
Rapid antigen tests exist for RSV and in|uenza virus, but these are not very sensitive (up to 70%). Although viral culture is still considered the gold standard, it is complicated, cumbersome, slow, and  lacks  sensitivity;  also  it  is  not  commonly  used  for  clinical diagnostics anymore. Instead, molecular methods to detect pathogen nucleic acids are rapid and sensitive and, when used in multiplex format,  can  detect  most  common  respiratory  viruses. They are often still expensive and require even more expensive equipment, laboratory infrastructure, and well-trained staff to be performed adequately, thus limiting their application in LMICs, but simpler and  more  portable  formats  of  molecular  diagnostics  are  being developed.
The identi{cation of one viral agent does not rule out double or mixed bacterial-viral infection. Recently several novel viruses have been identi{ed in the human respiratory tract (Bocavirus, WU and KI polyomaviruses, and several others). The signi{cance of  these  viruses  as  pathogens  has  yet  to  be  established.  With next-generation sequencing becoming more accessible for clinical diagnostics, including in LMICs, it is expected that many more such viruses will be discovered.
Another promising development is the use of rapid tests for biomarkers  of  bacterial  or  viral  infection  (C-reactive  protein, procalcitonin,  tumor  necrosis  factor-related  apoptosis-inducing ligand [TRAIL], interferon gamma-inducible protein 10 [IP-10], Myxovirus resistance A [MxA]) to rule out the more severe bacterial etiology and prevent inappropriate antibiotic usage.

============================================================
CHUNK 23
============================================================
PREVENTION AND TREATMENT
Yearly vaccines against in|uenza virus are produced twice a year for  the  Northern  and  Southern  Hemispheres  containing  the predominant lineages of H3N2, H1N1, and B viruses. The use in LMICs is limited due to the high cost and the need for annual revaccination. A live oral Adenovirus serotype 4 and 7 vaccine is used for military recruits in the USA, but is not in use for the general population or outside of the USA.
Vaccines  for  the  other  respiratory  viruses  are  currently  not available. Attempts at production of inactivated RSV vaccine were associated with more severe forms of disease in vaccinees.
Cidofovir is available for severe adenovirus infections but causes severe side effects and needs to be administered simultaneously with probenecid. Oral or aerosolized formulations of the broadspectrum anti-viral ribavirin inhibit replication of several respiratory viruses, including in|uenza virus and RSV, but is expensive and should not be used routinely. Humanized anti-RSV immunoglobulins (palivizumab) are available for the prevention of RSV infection in high-risk groups (neonates and infants with congenital heart or lung disease) but are very expensive. Pleconaril was developed for  the  common cold  and inhibits picornavirus replication, but its side effects outweighed the bene{ts for use in uncomplicated infections.
The adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) were options for prevention in outbreaks within closed communities of high-risk individuals  and,  less  convincingly,  for  treatment  of  in|uenza  A virus infections. However, these therapies have become obsolete, as most human and avian viruses are resistant.

============================================================
CHUNK 24
============================================================
PREVENTION AND TREATMENT
Neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir and zanamivir, which  inhibit  in|uenza  virus  neuraminidase,  are  effective  for treatment and  prophylaxis  of  in|uenza.  For  uncomplicated in|uenza, treatment is generally not required, but if at all, neuraminidase inhibitors need to be given within 48 hours of onset for  any  clinical  bene{t.  For  severe  in|uenza,  in|uenza  in  the immunocompromised,  and  avian  in|uenza,  bene{t  can  still  be found when administered after 48 hours, and treatment should not be withheld in these cases.
Parenteral formulations of oseltamivir and zanamivir and two new neuraminidase inhibitors (peramivir and laninamivir) are under investigation for the treatment of severe in|uenza. Convalescent plasmatherapy, monoclonal antibodies, and other forms of immunomodulation have shown promising results, warranting further evaluation in clinical trials.
Supportive and, if needed, intensive care and various forms of oxygen supplementation for severe respiratory distress (tachypnea, retractions,  cyanosis)  are  often  the  mainstay  of  treatment  of respiratory viral infections. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is  a  last  resort for  maintaining oxygen saturation during severe viral pneumonia. 17,18
In some parts of the world (especially Southeast Asia) antibiotics are extensively used to treat any form of mild respiratory illness. Although there may be some bene{t of the use of antibiotics in preventing secondary bacterial sinusitis, otitis media, or pneumonia, over-the-counter  availability  of  antibiotics,  self-medication,  or medication administration by untrained pharmacy workers should be discouraged because of the selection and subsequent spread of resistance in commensal oral and gut |ora.
