INTRODUCTION
As of the end of 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 33.3 million (31.4-35.3 million) persons were living with HIV infection [1]. During 2009, an estimated 2.6 million (2.3-2.8 million) new infections occurred worldwide. Sub-Saharan Africa has been most heavily affected by the HIV pandemic and bears the greatest  burden of  both  prevalent (22.5 million  or 68%)  and  new  (1.8 million or 69%) infections. The majority (52%) of persons living with HIV worldwide are women. Since the late 1990s, the global annual number of new infections has steadily declined (Fig. 27.1). Likewise, with the  significant  scale  up  of  antiretroviral  therapy  (ART),  AIDSrelated deaths have also decreased globally by 14% since 2004, when the availability of ART in the developing world dramatically expanded. As a result, prevalence has continued to increase (Fig. 27.2), although at a slower pace during the past decade.
The first cases of AIDS were recognized in the USA in 1981 [2]. Phylogenetic  analysis  of  HIV  sequences  suggests  that  HIV  originated  in Central  Africa  and  may  have  been  transmitted  to  humans  around 1930 [3]. By 1985, human HIV infection had been identified in every region of the world [4].
In some African countries, HIV has reduced life expectancy by more than  20  years,  slowed  economic  growth  and  deepened  household poverty  [5].  Globally,  AIDS  is  the  leading  cause  of  death  among people aged 15-59 years old in low-income countries (especially subSaharan Africa) [6]. Despite the remarkably rapid scientific advances that have been made in epidemiology, basic science and treatment, in 201 1, the HIV pandemic continues to represent one of the world's most urgent public health challenges.

INTRODUCTION
HIV  has  also  changed  the  practice  of  tropical  medicine  [7].  In many  countries  in  eastern  and  southern  Africa,  50-75%  of  adult medical inpatients at urban hospitals are HIV-infected [8-10]. As a result of the immunosuppression caused by HIV infection, susceptibility to, and severity of, other infectious diseases, especially opportunistic infections  (e.g. tuberculosis,  cryptococcal meningitis)  is increased. HIV-infected patients can exhibit atypical clinical presentations  of  infections  (e.g.  fever  as  the  only  presenting  symptom  of cryptococcal  meningitis)  [1 1]  and  immunosuppressed  HIV-infected patients  can  have  multiple  pathologic  processes  occurring  simultaneously.  The  differential  diagnoses  for  infectious  diseases  in  HIVinfected  persons  can  be  broad,  making  empiric  therapy  difficult. Thus,  rapid  and  accurate  diagnostic  testing-when  available-is important.
The HIV pandemic has also heightened our global consciousness to health  disparities,  social  justice  and  human  rights,  and  mobilized unprecedented political, financial and human resources to scale-up

MOLECULAR EPIDEMIOLOGY
There  are  two  main  types  of  HIV  (a  lentivirus):  HIV-1  and  HIV-2. HIV-1  comprises  three  phylogenetically  distinct  groups,  termed group M (main), group O (outlier), and group N (non-M, non-O) [16]. A fourth group (group P) has been proposed based on a single infection with a genetically unique HIV strain [17]. Each group has likely evolved from  independent  cross-species  transmissions  of chimpanzee  simian  immunodeficiency  virus  (SIVcpz)  to  humans [18-20]. HIV-1 group M has spread to every region of the world and is the virus responsible for the current global pandemic [21]. Group O infections are uncommon and limited to people living in, or epidemiologically linked to, Central Africa (especially Cameroon) [22]. Group  N  infections  have  been  described  rarely  and  only  in  Cameroon [23].
HIV-2 is a primate lentivirus related to HIV-1 that is less pathogenic and transmissible (see HIV-2 section) [24, 25]. HIV-2 evolved from the  cross-species  transmission  of  sooty  mangabey  SIV  (SIVsm)  to humans  [19,  26].  Although  HIV-2  infections  have  been  reported throughout the world, they are most prevalent in Guinea-Bissau [27, 28]  and  in  surrounding  West  African  countries,  as  well  as  other nations with economic or cultural links to the region (e.g. Portugal, India,  Angola,  Mozambique,  Cote  d'Ivoire,  Senegal,  France)  [24]. Recent  data  suggest  the  prevalence  of  HIV-2  in  Guinea-Bissau  has declined  to  less  than  5%  [27,  28].  Dual  infection  with  HIV-1  and HIV-2 has been described but the viruses do not appear to recombine with each other [29].
High rates of viral replication coupled with continuous mutation and recombination events have resulted in the rapid genetic diversification of HIV-1 group M viruses into 9 distinct subtypes (or clades) and over

MOLECULAR EPIDEMIOLOGY
49  circulating  recombinant  forms  (CRFs)  [30].  The  number  of described CRFs is cataloged at the Los Alamos HIV sequence database [30]. There are also a variety of unique recombinant forms (URFs) that have only been identified in a single person or in an epidemiologically linked pair of persons. The effects of variation between HIV-1 subtypes on pathogenesis, transmission, drug resistance, and immune control are not well understood.
The  initial  genetic  diversification  of  HIV-1  group  M  viruses  likely occurred in Central Africa,  where  the  greatest  diversity  and  earliest cases of HIV-1 have been identified [31].  Subsequently, HIV-1 subtypes have spread with a geographically heterogeneous distribution (Fig. 27.3) [21]. Subtype C, the dominant subtype in Southern Africa, Ethiopia, and India, causes nearly half (48%) of HIV infections worldwide [21]. The predominance of subtype C, especially in countries with high-prevalence epidemics driven by heterosexual sexual contact, has led to speculation that subtype C might have an increased fitness for transmission [32, 33]. Subtype A accounts for 12% of infections worldwide and has a broad geographic distribution. CRF01_AE and CRF02_AG are two additional recombinant viruses involving subtype A that are epidemiologically important in Southeast Asia and West Africa  respectively  [21].  The  emergence  of  these  CRFs  has  raised concern that recombination may contribute to the selection of viruses with  increased  fitness,  immune  escape  or  transmissibility  [34]. Subtype B predominates in the Americas, western and central Europe, and Australia.  Finally,  URFs  are  important  components  of  the  epidemics in East Africa, Central Africa, West Africa, and South America, and it is expected that some of these URFs will emerge as important CRFs in the future [21, 35-37].

Modes of Transmission
HIV  can  be  transmitted  by  sexual  contact;  through  contact  with infected blood, blood products, or human tissues; and from mother to child (Table 27-1) [38, 39]. Although HIV has been isolated from a variety of body fluids, only blood, semen, genital fluids, and breast milk have been proven as sources of infection. HIV is not transmitted

Modes of Transmission
Unprotected sexual contact is the predominant mode of HIV transmission globally [1]. Despite a relatively low efficiency of transmission  per  sexual  act  [40],  numerous  factors  increase  transmission, including mucosal microtrauma, bleeding (e.g. menstruation), concurrent  sexually  transmitted  infections  (STIs;  especially  those  that cause genital ulcerations), the stage of HIV infection and HIV viral load [41]. Concurrent sexual partners, and not simply the absolute number of partners, augment HIV's spread in a community [42]. Male circumcision reduces female-to-male transmission of HIV and may reduce male-to-female transmission to a lesser extent [43-45]. Certain genetic  factors  also  decrease  the  probability  of  HIV  transmission (Table 27-2) [46].
Among injection drug users (IDUs), HIV is transmitted by exposure to  HIV-infected  blood  through  shared  contaminated  needles  and other injection equipment. People who have sex with an IDU are at risk through sexual transmission [1, 47]. Nosocomial transmission in hospitals from reuse of syringes and needles has been documented [48-50], and the risk of acquiring HIV from a transfusion with HIVcontaminated blood products approaches 100% [51].
Mother-to-child transmission can take place during pregnancy, labor and delivery, and during breastfeeding. In non-breastfeeding populations,  the  majority of transmissions occur during  the short interval before delivery when the placenta separates from the uterine wall and labor occurs. An additional 30% of transmissions occur during late labor and the actual passage through the birth canal. In breastfeeding populations, approximately 40% of transmissions occur in the postnatal breastfeeding period. Overall rates of transmission are 25-40% (depending on breastfeeding practices) without prevention but can

Pre-chewing and feeding of food by an HIV-infected adult caregiver to an HIV-uninfected infant has been a potential cause of three HIV infections in North America [53]. No evidence suggests that saliva alone can transmit HIV.

GEOGRAPHIC EPIDEMIOLOGY
The prevalence of HIV infections varies dramatically with a disproportionate  number  of  infections  in  sub-Saharan  Africa  (Fig.  27.4). New HIV infections appear to have peaked in some regions and, in 22 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, rates have declined by more than 25% between 2001 and 2009 [1]. In several high-prevalence countries, HIV prevalence among young women attending antenatal clinics (a sentinel  population in generalized HIV epidemics) has declined in association with increases in condom usage and reductions in highrisk  sexual  behaviors  (e.g.  decreased  number  of  partners,  delayed sexual  debut)  among  young  people  [1].  Improvements  in  surveillance, which include expanding surveillance sites to antenatal clinics in  rural  areas  and  conducting  population-based  surveys,  can  make trends difficult to interpret.
For the purposes of surveillance, UNAIDS and the WHO classify HIV epidemics as generalized, concentrated or low-level [54]. Generalized epidemics are defined by a HIV prevalence consistently over 1% in pregnant women, a sentinel population used to assess trends in HIV prevalence and to estimate the adult HIV prevalence 2 , indicating that sexual networking in the general population is sufficient to sustain an epidemic independent of high-risk groups. Concentrated epidemics are defined by an HIV prevalence consistently over 5% in at least one defined high-risk group (i.e., men who have sex with men (MSM), IDU, commercial sex workers) and an HIV prevalence below 1% in pregnant women in urban areas indicating that HIV infection is not well established in the general population. Low-level epidemics are defined by an HIV prevalence that has not exceeded 5% in any defined high-risk group.

the  world's  total  population  [1,  55].  Although  considerable  efforts have improved access to antiretrovirals, 1.3 million Africans died of AIDS in 2009 (72% of the AIDS  deaths worldwide)  [1]. Southern Africa  now has  the  highest adult HIV prevalence  in the  world, followed by East Africa. Most countries in West and Central Africa have maintained a relatively low HIV prevalence (12 countries in West and Central Africa had an HIV prevalence of ≤ 2% in 2009). Geographic prevalence varies within countries. In Kenya, for example, HIV prevalence estimated in 2007 varied from 0.8% in the northeast to 14.9% in the western province of Nyanza [56].
HIV arrived late in southern Africa (South Africa had a HIV prevalence of less than 1% in 1988) but has spread rapidly (Fig. 27.5). Swaziland now has the most intense HIV epidemic in the world with an estimated one in four (26%) adults living with HIV infection in 2009 [1]. The nine countries with the highest adult HIV prevalence worldwide (with an HIV prevalence greater than 10%) are all located in southern Africa. Various social and biologic factors have played a role in the high prevalence rates. These include high rates of men migrating for work, concurrent sexual partnerships, genital herpes, low rates of male circumcision and gender-based inequalities [57].
Before  the  mid-2000s,  new  HIV  infections  in  sub-Saharan  Africa combined with AIDS-related  deaths  led  to  substantial  decreases  in life expectancy (Fig. 27.6) [58]. In Botswana, life expectancy fell from 65  years  in  1985  to  34  years  in  2006;  however,  with  antiretroviral scale-up  covering  approximately  90%  of  eligible  persons,  AIDSrelated  deaths  have  been  cut  in  half  from  an  estimated  18,000  in 2002 to 9100 in 2009 [59]. In Malawi, provision of ART has been linked  to  a  10%  drop  in  the  adult  death  rate  between  2004  and 2008 [60].

============================================================
Sub-Saharan Africa
Efforts at preventing new infections are gaining traction. In Zambia, there  is  delayed  sexual  debut  and  increased  condom  usage  among young adults age 15-19 years with coincident reductions in multiple sexual partnerships [1]. Throughout southern Africa, declining HIV prevalence  among  young  adults,  increased  testing  and  counseling services, and provision of perinatal ART for prevention of mother-tochild  transmission  (PMTCT)  have  reduced  new  infections  among children by 32% [1].
Denial  of  risk  remains  a  barrier.  In  a  2005  South  African  survey, half  of  people  who  tested  HIV-positive  believed  they  were  not  at risk  of  acquiring  infection  [61].  In  a  2007  Kenyan  survey  of  adult men  and  women  who  reported  not  testing  for  HIV  because  they were low risk, the HIV prevalence was 4.9% and 5.9% respectively [56].  Only  recently  has  the  burden  of  HIV  infections  among MSM  [62-66]  and  IDUs  [67]  in  sub-Saharan  Africa  begun  to  be appreciated. The contribution of infections by MSM is estimated to be  greater  than  that  by  IDU  because  many  MSM  also  have  sex with women, whereas injection drug use is a new, and smaller, phenomenon that provides fewer  opportunities  for  bridging  transmissions [67, 68].

============================================================
Asia
Although the adult HIV prevalence is lower in Asia (Fig. 27.7) than sub-Saharan  Africa,  there  were  still  an  estimated  4.5-5.5  million people living with HIV in 2009, with over 360,000 new infections and more than 300,000 deaths in 2009 [1]. Prevalence is highest in Southeast Asia, where commercial sex work, sex between men and injection drug use are the primary modes of transmission. HIV in the region is concentrated in high-risk groups (there are no generalized epidemics) and in many countries there are significant regional variations in their HIV prevalence. In China, for example, five provinces account for over 50% of people living with HIV [69]. In India, unprotected sex accounts for the majority of new infections (90%); however, sharing contaminated injection equipment is the main mode of transmission in India's north-eastern states [70].
In Thailand and Cambodia, HIV spread rapidly in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Initial cases were reported among MSM and IDUs, and, later, among female sex workers. Extensive public education and prevention  campaigns  have  had  some  success.  In  Thailand,  increased knowledge  of  HIV  and  changes  in  sexual  behavior  (e.g.  increased condom usage, fewer visits to sex workers) have correlated with reductions in HIV  prevalence among  new  military  conscripts [71]. Thailand's '100% Condom' campaign, which educated sex workers and  promoted  condom  use,  has  also  decreased  HIV  transmission from female commercial sex workers [72].

1990s, many experts predicted that Brazil's epidemic would rapidly accelerate. However, the country's sustained campaign to promote sex education,  condom  use,  harm  reduction  and  HIV  testing,  and  to provide universal ART has held adult prevalence below 1% [1]. The majority of HIV infections in South America occur among MSM [73] and IDU [67]. Incarcerated men are at particularly high risk [74]. In addition, in Central America, a high proportion of MSM (22%) have reported having sex with at least one female partner in the previous 6 months, underscoring the potential for HIV to bridge to women in this region [75].

NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS AND PATHOLOGY
The HIV-1 genome is organized into three major regions: gag , encoding  structural  proteins, pol ,  encoding  enzymes  (e.g.  reverse  transcriptase, protease and integrase) necessary for viral replication, and env ,  encoding  envelope  proteins  (Fig.  27.8)  [76].  In  addition,  the HIV genome contains six regulatory genes ( tat, rev, nef, vpr, vpu , and vif ) that facilitate viral replication and host immune evasion. HIV is spherical  with  a  diameter  of  1/10,000  of  a  millimeter  (Fig.  27.9) [77].  The  outer  coat, known as the  viral  envelope,  is  composed  of two lipid layers taken from the membrane of a human cell when a newly  formed  virus  particle  buds.  Within  the  inner  viral  protein core are two copies of positive, single-stranded RNA that are tightly bound  to  nucleocapsid  proteins  and  viral  enzymes  necessary  for replication.
HIV is able to avoid intracellular antiviral defenses (e.g. APOBEC3G/3F and TRIM5 α ), while activating and exploiting cellular machinery to replicate (Fig. 27.10). HIV infects and replicates in cells that express the CD4 receptor, in particular CD4 + T lymphocytes. HIV's envelope protein  (gp120)  binds  to  the  CD4  receptor  and  to  additional co-receptors (i.e. CCR5 or CXCR4), leading to viral fusion with the cell and entry of HIV's inner viral core (steps 1 and 2 in Fig. 27.10) [77]. HIV's reverse transcriptase then converts the single-stranded HIV RNA  genome  into  double-stranded  DNA  (step  3).  Reverse  transcriptase is error prone and it is at this step that mutations and strand recombinations generate genetically distinct viral variants. The viral DNA then complexes with HIV integrase, is transported into the host cell's  nucleus  and  is  integrated  with  the  help  of  host  DNA  repair enzymes into a transcriptionally active location in the host's chromosomal DNA (step 4). This step irreversibly transforms the cell into a producer of virus. A certain proportion of cells infected by HIV are

resting memory T lymphocytes, which provide the virus with a persistent, long-lived reservoir that currently available antivirals are unable to  eliminate.  Both  host  and  viral  factors  stimulate  transcription  of viral RNA from the integrated DNA. This new viral RNA is translated into viral proteins (step 5) and these materials move to the cell membrane and new, immature HIV virions form and bud off from the cell with the help of host proteins (step 6). Once released, the HIV virion matures when HIV protease enzyme cleaves the gag-pol polyprotein into smaller functional proteins (step 7).
HIV transmission is inefficient (especially sexual transmission) and many HIV exposures do not result in HIV infection (Table 27-1). Successful HIV transmission occurs when HIV is able to cross the host's mucosal barrier and infect CD4 + T  lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. At this early stage, HIV must avoid host defenses that could extinguish the infection while recruiting target cells, specifically CD4 + T lymphocytes, to the site of infection. These initially infected cells return to regional lymph nodes where HIV is able to amplify by infecting other CD4 + T  lymphocytes. When these infected lymphocytes migrate into the bloodstream, HIV is dispersed throughout the body and causes massive infection of susceptible CD4 + T lymphocytes in the gastrointestinal tract, lymph system, spleen, and bone marrow. Up to 60% of memory CD4 + T lymphocytes in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue are infected and killed within weeks of infection [78-80]. This infection corresponds to a peak in HIV plasma viremia and the appearance of clinical symptoms of acute HIV infection (Fig. 27.1 1).

NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS AND PATHOLOGY
In response, the host generates both a humoral and cellular adaptive immune response and HIV viremia declines. This decline results primarily from the immune response (particularly the development of cytotoxic  CD8 + T  lymphocytes  against  HIV)  but  also,  to  a  lesser degree, from the depletion of available target cells. Within 6 months, an individual's viral load will reach a set-point; many individuals will be asymptomatic for years, although they remain infectious. The HIV viral load set-point varies greatly among individuals (in one study of 74  HIV-infected  adults,  the  median  HIV  viral  load  set-point  was 36,000 copies/mL (range: 200-717,000 copies/ml) at 120 days after HIV infection [81]) because of host and viral factors (Table 27-2), and a higher viral set-point predicts more rapid disease progression [82, 83].  Although  clinically  quiescent,  this  stage  of  HIV  infection  is

To keep pace, T lymphocyte proliferation  is  greatly  upregulated.  However,  over  time,  there  is  a  gradual destruction of  naïve and memory CD4 T lymphocytes. The rate of CD4 decline is variable [85, 86]. The median rate of CD4 decline has ranged from 37-74 cells/ μ l/year in studies from Africa [87, 88].

MANIFESTATIONS AND MANAGEMENT OF HIV INFECTION AND COMPLICATIONS OF HIV DISEASE
As the CD4 cell count declines, an HIV-infected person's susceptibility to  infections  and  infection-related  malignancies  that  are  normally controlled by the cell-mediated immune system increases. This susceptibility is  greatest  when  the  CD4  cell count  declines  below  200 cells/ μ l. In high-income countries, the term 'AIDS' describes the most advanced stage of HIV-infection characterized by severe immunodeficiency (e.g. CD4 cell count < 200 cells/ μ l in the USA) and development  of  opportunistic  illnesses.  In  addition,  HIV  causes  chronic inflammation  and  has  direct  effects  on  a  variety  of  organs;  many patients suffer from enteropathy, myopathy, neuropathy, or encephalopathy. Disease progression in the absence of ART varies with characteristics of the infecting virus, the host immune response and other factors. In general, disease progression is more rapid in children and older adults. Among infants, acquisition of HIV in utero predicts more rapid disease progression in the absence of treatment [89].

ACUTE HIV INFECTION
Acute HIV infection is the stage between HIV acquisition and development of detectable anti-HIV antibodies [90]. An estimated 40-90% of  persons  experience  symptoms  during  acute  HIV  infection  [91]. Acute  HIV  often  presents  as  an  infectious  mononucleosis-like  or influenza-like syndrome, but the clinical features can be highly variable. Symptoms typically begin a median of 10 days after HIV acquisition (Table 27-3), and include fever, maculopapular rash, arthralgia,

ACUTE HIV INFECTION
myalgia,  malaise,  lymphadenopathy,  oral  ulcers,  pharyngitis,  and weight loss [92]. The presence of fever and rash has the best positive predictive value [93]. Unfortunately, acute symptomatic HIV infection is rarely diagnosed by healthcare providers as its symptoms are often attributed to other viral infections or secondary syphilis [94].
Acute HIV infection is defined as having detectable HIV RNA 3 or HIV p24 antigen (a major core protein of HIV) in the presence of a negative  or  indeterminate  serologic  HIV  antibody  test  [97].  Although  a positive HIV RNA or HIV p24 antigen in the setting of a negative or indeterminate serologic HIV antibody test is diagnostically consistent with acute HIV infection, the diagnosis should be confirmed with an HIV antibody test performed over the next 3 months to document seroconversion [98, 99]. New advances in HIV testing technology [i.e. the increased use of fourth-generation enzyme immunoassay (EIA) tests that can detect both p24 antigen and anti-HIV antibodies] may improve its diagnosis [100, 101]. Identifying individuals during acute HIV is an important public health goal. During acute infection, HIV replicates extensively and can achieve a very high viral load, which increases the risk of further transmission (Fig. 27.1 1) [41, 46]. Pregnant  women  in  high  HIV  prevalence  settings  may  be  particularly vulnerable  to  acute  HIV  infection  and  subsequent  mother-to-child transmission  of  HIV  [102].  Diagnosis  should  prompt  preventive counseling to inform patients that they are highly infectious and to help reduce their risk of transmitting HIV. If testing for HIV RNA is not available but acute HIV is suspected, the patient should receive preventive counseling and repeat HIV antibody testing in 3-6 months.
3 HIV RNA can be detected by qualitative and quantitative nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT). The level of HIV viremia usually peaks with the onset of clinical symptoms of acute HIV infection [46]. Clinicians should suspect a false positive NAAT result if the HIV RNA level is less than 10,000 copies/ml in a patient with symptoms suggestive of acute HIV infection [95, 96]. In this setting, a repeat NAAT test should be performed as a rising HIV RNA level would suggest a true positive result.

STAGING OF HIV DISEASE
The  two  commonly  used  systems  for  the  clinical  staging  of  HIV disease are those developed by the WHO [103] and the USA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [104]. While these staging systems were defined primarily for surveillance purposes, they provide important prognostic and management information. The WHO clinical staging system classifies patients from Stage 1 (asymptomatic) to Stage  4  (life-threatening  opportunistic  infections  or  HIV-associated conditions) based on clinical and laboratory findings (Table 27-4). In resource-limited settings, inadequate laboratory capacity can limit the ability  to measure  CD4  cell counts  or diagnose  HIV-associated illnesses and accurately stage disease. The CDC surveillance case definitions are: Stage 1 (CD4 + T-lymphocyte count ≥ 500 cells/ µ l); Stage 2  (CD4 + T-lymphocyte  count = 200-499  cells/ µ l);  Stage  3  (CD4 + T-lymphocyte count of < 200 cells/ µ L or an AIDS-defining condition); or Stage unknown (Table 27-5).
In  the  absence  of  effective  ART,  HIV  infection  induces  progressive immune  suppression.  Opportunistic  illnesses  closely  relate  to  the degree  of  immune  suppression.  The  risk  for  specific  opportunistic illness can be anticipated based on the patient's CD4 + count.  Conversely,  the  occurrence  of  certain  opportunistic  illnesses  can  be  a marker for the degree of HIV disease progression. Figure 27.12 illustrates the CD4 + T lymphocyte counts at which opportunistic illnesses typically occur.

Variation in risk by gender for some opportunistic illnesses has been reported  (i.e.  higher  rates  of  tuberculosis  among HIV-infected men [105]); however, observed differences have not been great enough to alter screening and prophylaxis recommendations for women compared  with  men.  Disease  in  children  mirrors  that  in  adults  with several important differences [106].

Visceral leishmaniasis occurs in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, around the  Mediterranean  Sea,  on  the  Indian  subcontinent  and  in  South America. In Southeast Asia, most notably Thailand, systemic infection with the fungus Penicillium marneffei occurs with advanced immunosuppression (CD4 cell count < 50 cells/ μ l) [109]. Histoplasma capsulatum occurs  throughout  central  and  southern  USA,  the  tropics  and subtropics, but is rare in Europe and Asia [1 10, 1 1 1]. Finally, there is substantial overlap between geographic areas affected by HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria (Fig. 27.13 and 27.14) [1 12].
Management  of  opportunistic  illnesses  is  complex  and  must  be tailored to the local spectrum of disease [108, 1 13]. The WHO and others have developed and updated international guidelines for the

Cryptococcal Meningitis
Infection with Cryptococcus neoformans rivals tuberculosis as a cause of death  in  persons  with  HIV  infection  [1 16].  It  usually  manifests  as meningitis but can also present as pneumonia. Cryptococcal meningitis  is  characterized  by  headache,  fever,  altered  mental  status,  and cranial nerve palsies; notably, meningismus may not be prominent or completely absent.
Approximately 50% of HIV-infected patients with cryptococcal meningitis  have  elevated  baseline  intracranial  pressures  [i.e. > 25 cm of cerebrospinal  fluid  (CSF)]  and  patients  with  a  higher  intracranial pressure tend to have a higher fungal burden [1 17]. The organism can be cultured from CSF in the majority of patients and from the blood in up to 75% of patients [1 15]. Testing for cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) in CSF or in serum is sensitive and specific [1 18-120]. Serum CrAg testing can be useful for screening or when lumbar puncture cannot be performed.
The most effective treatment for cryptococcal meningitis (see Chapter 84) is a combination of amphotericin B and flucytosine with management of increased intracranial pressure, such as by repeated lumbar punctures  [121].  Fluconazole  is  an  alternative  when  amphotericin cannot be given and should be combined with flucytosine if flucytosine  and  laboratory  monitoring  are  available  [122,  123].  Monotherapy with fluconazole is likely inferior [124] but, in some situations, may be the only option.

============================================================
Cryptococcal Meningitis
In  persons with acute cryptococcal  meningitis, there are conflicting data regarding the optimal timing of ART (e.g. concurrent with initiation of antifungal therapy or delayed) [125-128]. A randomized clinical  trial  in  Zimbabwe  evaluated  the  timing of  ART in  HIV-infected patients who were newly diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis and treated with fluconazole monotherapy. In this trial, early initiation of ART (within 72 hours of the cryptococcal meningitis diagnosis) was associated with increased mortality [presumably as a result of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)] compared with delaying ART for 10 weeks [126]. Thus, it may be prudent to delay initiation for at least 2 weeks-possibly longer if fluconazole monotherapy is used.  For  persons  who  recover  from  an  initial  episode,  secondary prophylaxis is recommended. While there are few data from resourcelimited settings, it is assumed that discontinuation following immune recovery on ART is safe. Primary prophylaxis with fluconazole prevents cryptococcal disease, and may be cost effective in settings with high  disease  prevalence  [129].  Alternate  approaches  to  reducing the burden of cryptococcal disease are early initiation of ART or preemptive antifungal therapy to persons with asymptomatic cryptococcal infection [130].

Pneumocystis Pneumonia
PCP disease progression can be rapid, particularly in children, thus prevention  by  primary  antimicrobial  prophylaxis  is  a  priority  (see
' Prevention: Special Considerations for Antimicrobial Prophylaxis in Resource-Limited  Settings' below). PCP is most  common in patients with CD4 cell counts < 200 cells/ μ l. PCP typically presents with fever, a  dry  cough  and  progressive  dyspnea.  Hypoxia  is  common, serum lactate  dehydrogenase  is  typically  elevated  and  chest  x-ray  usually reveals diffuse interstitial infiltrates that are often perihilar.

BACTERIAL INFECTIONS
While  identification  of  bacterial  illness  is  unusual  in  resourcelimited  settings,  epidemiologic  studies  have  confirmed  the  importance  of Streptococcus  pneumoniae and  non-typhoid Salmonella in adults and children with HIV [131, 132], and Haemophilus influenzae in  children  [133,  134].  Clinical  manifestations  of S.  pneumoniae vary; pneumococcal infection presents most commonly as pneumonia or sinusitis, but meningitis also occurs and any presentation can be accompanied by pneumococcal bacteremia. WHO guidelines on the treatment of diarrhea and pneumonia in HIV-infected children and  infants  should  be  consulted  for  up-to-date  recommendations: (http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2010/9789241548083_ eng.pdf) [135].

SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS (STIs)
Many HIV-infected persons are at risk for STIs; these can also increase the risk  of  HIV  transmission  and acquisition  [136].  Diagnosis  and management of STIs in persons with HIV is similar to persons without HIV. However, clinical presentations of some STIs can be more severe with HIV, for example ulcerative lesions may be more extensive. Algorithms for syndromic management of STIs have not performed as well in  persons  with  HIV  and  specific  diagnoses  should  be  confirmed where possible [137].

CHUNK 34
============================================================
VIRAL HEPATITIS
Prevalence of hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) in HIV-infected persons  can  be  higher  than  in  HIV-uninfected  persons  because  of shared routes of transmission [138]. Co-infection of HIV with HBV or HCV increases the mortality risk, but may have modest impact on the  progression  of  HIV  disease.  However,  co-infected  patients  are at increased risk of cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma.
All persons with HIV and viral hepatitis should avoid alcohol consumption and use precautions to prevent transmission of viral hepatitis. A number of antiretroviral agents are active against both HIV and HBV. Therefore, guidelines now recommend that ART be started in any person diagnosed with active HBV or HCV [98, 139-141] (see ' Antiretroviral Therapy: What to Start-Special Considerations in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis B Infection ' below).
Baseline testing of HIV-infected persons for active hepatitis B infection can identify persons who should be prioritized to receive dually active antiretroviral  regimens  [142].  In  settings  where  HBV  prevalence  is high,  it  may  be  cost-effective  to  consider  empiric  ART  with  dually active (i.e. active against both HIV and HBV) regimens. The objectives of treating HBV are normalization of alanine aminotransferase, hepatitis B e antigen seroconversion, suppression of hepatitis B viral load and  improvement  in  liver  histology.  Withdrawal  of  dually  active therapy  in  HBV-co-infected  patients  can  lead  to  HBV  reactivation [143,  144].  Therefore,  HBV-infected  patients  on  dually  active  regimens  should  be  advised  against  self-discontinuation  and  closely monitored for hepatic injury if the regimen must be stopped.
Cure of HCV infection, defined as the sustained elimination of HCV RNA from the serum and liver, is possible. The existing standard of care-HCV protease inhibitors, pegylated interferon and ribavirin-is complex to manage because of the usual occurrence of adverse events that require clinical and laboratory monitoring. Directly-acting agents against HCV infection (e.g. HCV protease inhibitors) are in development [145-150].

FEVER
Prolonged fever is common, especially among patients with low CD4 cell counts (e.g. < 200 cells/ml) who are not receiving ART [151], and differential  diagnosis  is  broad  and  varies  geographically.  Infectious etiologies are responsible for the majority of fevers.
Tuberculosis should be considered in all patients with fever especially if cough, shortness of breath, weight loss, night sweats, or lymphadenopathy are present (see Chapter 39, ' Tuberculosis ') [131]. Other causes of fever are cryptococcal disease (e.g. C. neoformans bloodstream infection),  bacteremia  (e.g. Salmonella , Rhodococcus ),  pneumonia,  both bacterial (e.g. S.  pneumoniae )  and  fungal (e.g. PCP), malaria, CMV, and lymphoma. Multiple concurrent etiologies occur.
The  diagnostic  work-up  for  fever  should  be  driven  by  the  clinical presentation and availability of diagnostic tests. Blood cultures, blood smear for malaria, mycobacterial blood cultures and serum cryptococcal antigen testing can be helpful. Chest radiography, urine culture, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, and other radiologic studies (e.g. brain imaging, abdominal imaging) may be necessary. Certain etiologies such as mycobacterial disease, Pneumocystis , Bartonella , lymphoma and certain fungal infections can be particularly difficult to diagnose and  should  be  considered  when  fever  persists  despite  a  diagnostic work-up.

Dermatologic disease can have a broad differential diagnosis, especially in patients with advanced immunosuppression [152]. The International  AIDS  Society-USA  (www.iasusa.org)  has  useful  reference materials [152].
Pruritic papular eruption (PPE) is common in tropical environments. PPE may be caused by a hypersensitivity to insect bites and presents with  extremely  pruritic  papules  ( < 1 cm)  predominately  on  the extremities that can be hyperpigmented and excoriated from scratching [153] (Fig. 27.15). PPE is diagnosed clinically and improves with ART; topical steroids and capsaicin can help. Bacterial folliculitis (e.g. staphylococcal folliculitis) can present with lesions similar to PPE.  However,  the  lesions  are  follicular,  fewer  in  number,  variably

pruritic and occur more commonly on the upper trunk and buttocks. Staphylococcal  folliculitis  can  be  treated  with  topical  or  oral  antistaphylococcal antibiotics. Eosinophilic folliculitis presents with pruritic papules on the face, neck, and upper trunk, and can mimic acne. It responds best to ART, but may paradoxically worsen. Topical steroids or oral itraconazole can improve symptoms.

DERMATOLOGIC DISEASE
Scabies can present with pruritic papular lesions similar to those seen with PPE; however, scabies lesions tend to be clustered in the finger webs, waist, ankles, axillae, breasts, and genital areas, and burrows can sometimes be seen. Severe scabies ('Norwegian' scabies) can present with a crusted thick grayish scale teeming with mites. Scratching of scabies lesions can lead to bacterial superinfection. Oral ivermectin or  topical  agents  are  effective.  Prurigo  nodularis-a  condition  that results from intense scratching-presents with larger ( > 1 cm) pruritic nodules that often start on the extremities with a symmetric distribution; management should identify the underlying cause of pruritis. Topical steroids, topical capsaicin, and oral antihistamines can ameliorate symptoms.
Seborrheic dermatitis presents with dandruff and indistinct plaques of  yellowish  scale  involving  the  scalp,  face,  chest,  back,  and  groin. Although it can typically be seen on the hair-bearing area of the head (e.g. eyebrows, outer ear canal), in the context of HIV infection, and especially in Africa, it occurs at skin folds (e.g. axillae, inner thighs). Mild  cases  respond  to  dandruff  shampoo  (e.g.  selenium sulfide or zinc pyrithione).  More severe cases require  topical  antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole) directed against Pityrosporum yeasts such as Malassezia furfur and steroids. Refractory cases may require oral ketoconazole.
Photodermatitis  frequently  occurs  in  Africa  and  presents  with  an itchy, scaly rash. It is differentiated from seborrheic dermatitis by its distribution  on  sun-exposed  areas  of  skin.  Although  sulfonamides can be photosensitizing, their use in treating HIV infection is important  and  they  should  not  be  stopped,  if  possible,  because  of photodermatitis.

DERMATOLOGIC DISEASE
Human  herpesvirus  8  infection  (HHV-8),  the  cause  of  Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), is endemic to much of Africa. KS commonly occurs in patients with advanced HIV disease (see ' HIV-associated Malignancies ' below)  [154].  It  presents  with  reddish,  violaceous  or  brown  nontender  macules  and  papules  that  progress  to  nodules.  KS  often involves the head and neck but can involve several anatomical sites; oral lesions on the tongue, palate, and buccal mucosa may precede
skin  disease.  Advanced  KS  causes  widely  disseminated  skin  disease with lymphatic obstruction and involvement of the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. KS can regress with ART, especially if detected at an early stage. Bacillary angiomatosis caused by infection with Bartonella henselae or quintana can  cause  similar  lesions  as  KS  but  is  treated effectively  with  antibiotics.  Likewise,  dermal  non-Hodgkin  lymphoma can have a similar presentation but occurs rarely.
Molluscum contagiosum is caused by a poxvirus and is common in HIV-infected  children.  It  presents  with  dome-shaped  umbilicated papules. Disseminated cryptococcosis can present with similar lesions that  precede  the  development  of  systemic  disease  but  the  onset  is usually abrupt.
Genital and non-genital warts caused by human papillomavirus are common in tropical  environments  and  HIV-infected  children  may develop  hundreds  of  flat  warts.  Syphilis  should  be  considered  in patients presenting with disseminated maculopapular skin disease or condylomata lata.
The possibility of drug eruptions should always be considered. Mucocutaneous eruptions, blisters or other erosive dermal lesions should prompt consideration of Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis  [155, 156]. Decisions on whether to stop treatment with the suspect agent or to 'treat through' need to be made on a case-by-case basis.

OPHTHALMOLOGIC DISEASE
Eye disease is an important complication [157-159]. CMV retinitis is the  most  common  cause  of  retinal  disease  and  vision  loss  with advanced  immunosuppression  (i.e.  CD4  cell  count < 50  cells/ μ l) [158].  CMV retinitis  can be  diagnosed  by retinal  examination that demonstrates large white or creamy lesions with granular borders and associated hemorrhage (Fig. 27.16). Lesions often begin in the periphery  and  progress  centrally;  patients  complain  of  unilateral  floaters followed by progressively decreased visual acuity and eventual blindness.  CMV retinitis  should  be treated with  ART  and  CMV  antiviral therapy (e.g. oral valganciclovir, intravenous ganciclovir, or intraocular ganciclovir).  It  can  be  confused  with  HIV  retinopathy,  which  has characteristic  'cotton-wool'  spots  on  retinal  examination.  These lesions  are  not  sight  threatening  and  often  resolve  spontaneously [160]. Other causes of rapid vision loss are progressive outer retinal necrosis caused by varicella-zoster virus and, less commonly, by herpes simplex. Squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva, corneal microsporidiosis,  ocular  tuberculosis,  and  syphilitic  chorio  retinitis  and uveitis can cause ophthalmologic disease in low-income settings.

PULMONARY DISEASE
In most clinical and autopsy case series of lung disease in HIV-infected patients, tuberculosis is among the most frequently identified pathogens and should be considered with any pulmonary infection (see Chapter  39,  ' Tuberculosis ').  Community-acquired  pneumonia,  frequently caused by S. pneumoniae , is the next most common cause of lung disease [161, 162]. Tuberculosis and community-acquired pneumonia can occur at any time during HIV infection, but risk increases as the CD4 cell count declines. Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis and pneumococcal conjugate vaccination may be effective prevention strategies [163, 164]. PCP presents as a subacute process. KS, histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis,  nocardiosis  and,  in  children,  lymphoid  interstitial pneumonititis, are less common causes.
Pleural effusions are most often secondary to infection or malignancy [165].  Pleural  tuberculosis  can  occur  with or without parenchymal disease. Tuberculous pleural effusions are exudative, lymphocytic and not  acidic  or  hypoglycemic.  They  typically  demonstrate  concentrations  of  adenosine  deaminase  (ADA)  greater  than  50 U/l  [166].  A pleural fluid acid-fast smear is positive in less than 15% of cases, but a sputum smear may be positive. Pleural biopsies with examination for  acid-fast  bacilli  and  granulomas  have  the  highest  likelihood  of confirming pleural infection. Bacterial pneumonia often causes parapneumonic effusions. KS, multicentric Castleman's disease, primary effusion lymphoma, B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and lung cancer are malignant causes of effusion.

ESOPHAGEAL DISEASE
Dysphagia  (i.e. difficulty  swallowing  with  a  sensation  of  food sticking)  and  odynophagia  (i.e.  pain  on  swallowing)  occur  with advanced  HIV  infection  and  suggest  esophagitis.  Candidiasis  is the most common cause [115, 167] and is usually associated with oropharyngeal candidiasis (thrush) (Fig. 27.17). Empiric treatment for candidal esophagitis with fluconazole is usually indicated, especially in patients with a CD4 count < 200 cells/ μ L or if oral thrush is present. Patients who do not respond to fluconazole can be treated with a higher dose, and patients who still do not respond should be considered  for  upper  endoscopy  with  biopsy.  Other  etiologies  are CMV, herpes simplex virus, and aphthous ulcers, each of which tends to be associated with more prominent odynophagia (often without dysphagia).

GASTROENTERITIS/DIARRHEAL DISEASE
Acute diarrhea suggests a viral or bacterial pathogen although certain parasitic  infections  ( Isospora  belli , Entamoeba  histolytica )  can  present

acutely.  Diarrhea  and  fever  suggest Salmonella , Shigella ,  or Campylobacter ,  especially if mucus or blood are in the stool [168]. Bacterial diarrhea should be treated with antibiotics [1 15] guided by culture and antimicrobial sensitivity testing. Enteric  viruses (e.g. norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus) and pathogenic Escherichia coli (e.g. enteroaggregative,  enterotoxigenic  and  enterohemorrhagic E.  coli )  can  also cause  acute  diarrhea  [169,  170]. Clostridium  difficile occurs  among HIV-infected patients in developed nations exposed to antibiotics or who have been hospitalized [171]. Non-infectious etiologies of acute diarrhea can be secondary to drugs, food poisoning (e.g. bacterial or marine toxins), lactose intolerance, inflammatory bowel disease, or infiltrative diseases (i.e. lymphoma or Kaposi's sarcoma). ART, especially protease inhibitors (e.g. nelfinavir), can also be associated with diarrhea and should be considered if other etiologies can be ruled out [172]. ART-associated diarrhea can often be managed symptomatically but in severe cases may require a single drug substitution to an alternative medication.

GASTROENTERITIS/DIARRHEAL DISEASE
In patients with a low CD4 count ( < 200 cells/ μ l), cryptosporidiosis owing  to  infection  with Cryptosporidium  parvum,  C.  hominis ,  or C. maleagridis is a cause of chronic diarrhea [173-176]. Other causes are isosporiasis,  microsporidiosis, Mycobacterium  avium complex,  cyclosporiasis, and CMV. Giardiasis, amoebiasis, and strongyloidiasis can occur at any stage of HIV infection. Even with access to diagnostic testing (e.g. stool leukocyte evaluation, stool culture, stool examination for ova and parasites with a modified acid-fast stain for Cryptosporidium )  and  endoscopy  with  biopsy,  a  significant  proportion  of chronic diarrhea has no pathogen identified and is attributed to HIV enteropathy  [177].  While  some  causes  of  chronic  diarrhea  can  be treated (i.e.  trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole  for  isosporiasis  and cyclosporiasis),  cryptosporidiosis  and  microsporidiosis  are  often refractory to antimicrobial therapy alone. For these patients, immune reconstitution with ART is necessary [178].

============================================================
FOCAL CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (CNS) LESIONS
HIV-infected patients with advanced immunosuppression  who present  with  focal  neurologic  symptoms  or  seizures  often  have  a central  nervous system (CNS) mass lesion caused by an opportunistic  infection  or  HIV-associated  malignancy.  The  evaluation  and management of these lesions can be challenging if access to radiography [e.g. computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] and neurosurgery are limited [179, 180]. The most common  etiology  of  focal  CNS  lesions  in  low-income  settings has been tuberculosis (tuberculomas) [179], but neurocysticercosis, toxoplasma  encephalitis,  primary  CNS  lymphoma,  non-Hodgkin lymphoma,  bacterial  brain  abscess,  cryptococcosis  and,  in  South America,  brain  chagoma  caused  by Trypanosoma  cruzi ,  are  considerations.  Tuberculosis  should  be  strongly  suspected  if  there  is evidence  of  non-neurologic  tuberculosis  (e.g.  lung  disease),  basal meningeal  enhancement  on  CT  scan  or  a  CSF  pleocytosis  with  a high protein.
Toxoplasma  encephalitis  presents  with  fever,  headache,  weakness, altered  mental  status  or  confusion,  and  possibly  seizures;  physical exam  usually  demonstrates  focal  neurologic  abnormalities  [181]. Most  patients  have  a  CD4  cell  count < 100  cells/ μ l  and  positive toxoplasma  serology  [182].  Empiric  therapy  with  pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine,  and  leucovorin is  indicated;  clinical  improvement should  be  seen  within  1-2  weeks  if  the  diagnosis  is  correct.  In resource-limited settings, use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole may  be  considered  if  the  first-line  drugs  are  not  available  [183, 184].
Progressive  multifocal  leukoencephalopathy  (PML)  is  an  insidious and progressive disorder caused by John Cunningham (JC) virus that usually presents with one or more rapidly progressive focal neurologic  deficits  without  fever  in  advanced  HIV  infection  [1 15].  The diagnosis can be made by identification of JC virus in CSF or demonstration  of  characteristic  lesions  by  CNS  imaging.  No  specific therapy  exists;  treatment  is  ART  to  restore  immunity  against  the JC virus.

============================================================
IMMUNE RECONSTITUTION INFLAMMATORY SYNDROME (IRIS)
Occasionally,  and  especially  in  persons  with  low  CD4  cell  counts, immune reconstitution  following  initiation  of  ART  can  unmask  a clinically quiescent co-infection or lead to paradoxical worsening of an active previously diagnosed co-infection; in both cases the patient's clinical condition can worsen [185]. This ART-mediated IRIS occurs with mycobacterial infections, usually tuberculosis, as well as CMV retinitis,  cryptococcal  meningitis,  and  PML  [185].  However,  it  has occurred with almost every AIDS-associated opportunistic infection and a variety of  non-AIDS-associated infections and illnesses [186, 187]. In general, the benefits of early initiation of ART outweigh the risk of IRIS. IRIS can usually be managed without interrupting ART by treating the associated co-infection and providing supportive care, which can include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or corticosteroids. ART should be stopped with IRIS that is either lifethreatening or that cannot be managed with supportive care.

HIV-ASSOCIATED MALIGNANCIES
Persons with HIV infection are at increased risk for three malignancies:  KS,  non-Hodgkin lymphomas, and cervical cancer [104, 188]. The incidence of KS and non-Hodgkin lymphomas has declined dramatically  in  high-income  countries  among  persons  receiving  ART [189-191]. In regions where life expectancies of persons living with HIV infection have increased, the incidence of non-AIDS-associated malignancies has  increased  at  rates  in  excess  of  rates  for  the  same cancers in HIV-uninfected persons [192]. Whether similar trends are occurring in resource-limited settings is difficult to determine [193]. Many non-AIDS malignancies are associated with chronic oncogenic viral  infections:  human papillomavirus (HPV;  anal  and  oropharyngeal cancer), Epstein-Barr virus (non-Hodgkin lymphoma), and viral hepatitis B and C (hepatoma) [194, 195]. Others are associated with lifestyle  factors  that  are  more  prevalent  among certain  populations (e.g. tobacco use). Some data suggest that HIV infection independently  increases  risk  for  non-AIDS  malignancies;  however,  it  is  not evident whether ART affects this risk [196-198].

CHUNK 47
============================================================
Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS)
KS is caused by HHV-8 and the endemic prevalence (i.e. HIV-unassociated)  generally  correlates  with  regional  HHV-8  seroprevalence; however, immunosuppression from HIV can increase the incidence and prevalence of KS [199-202]. KS is common in African countries of  Zambia,  Democratic  Republic  of  Congo,  Zimbabwe,  Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi [203-205]. Although endemic KS is uncommon in the Americas, Europe, and Asia, persons with HIV infection, and especially MSM, experience greater  incidence of disease [206]. With ART, KS may regress [207] and protease inhibitors appear  to have specific activity against HHV-8 [208]. Extensive visceral or rapidly progressive disease often requires cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation therapy, which are generally palliative and not curative [201].

============================================================
CHUNK 48
============================================================
Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
Non-Hodgkin lymphomas are the second most common malignancy associated with HIV infection and comprise a heterogeneous group of tumors that are almost  all of B-cell origin [209]. Many  of these tumors appear causally related to either Epstein-Barr virus or HHV-8 [210].  Incidence is increased substantially among patients with low CD4  cell  counts.  Diagnosis  is  based  on  clinical  presentation  (e.g. lymphadenopathy, fevers, night sweats, weight loss) and biopsy. Treatment and prognosis vary according to the type of tumor and available therapy.

============================================================
CHUNK 49
============================================================
Cervical Cancer
Cervical cancer is a leading cause of death among women worldwide and a common AIDS-related malignancy [21 1]. The vast majority of cervical cancers, including among HIV-infected women, are caused by infection with oncogenic types of HPV [212, 213]. HPV infections are more common and persistent in women with HIV. Risk for cervical
cancer  is  not  correlated  with  CD4  cell  count.  Incidence  of  cervical cancer has not declined significantly in high-income settings where ART use is widespread [193], although women who are adherent to ART demonstrate lower incidence and prevalence of oncogenic HPV types [214].
Screening and earlier intervention are key aspects of preventing cervical  cancer.  Traditional  population-based  cervical  cancer  prevention programs that rely upon examination of cervical cells face substantial barriers to sustainability in resource-limited settings. These include a lack  of  resources  (e.g.  cytopathology  services,  surgery  and  chemotherapy,  infrastructure  to  support  screening,  and  treatment)  and trained healthcare workers (e.g. persons that collect specimens, cytotechnologists, clinicians for medical and surgical management of cervical  disease),  and  the  requirement  that  patients  attend  multiple medical  visits  [215].  Innovative  'see-and-treat'  programs,  where women with cervical pathology during direct visual examination of the cervix after application of acetic acid are treated at the same visit with  cryotherapy,  show  great  promise  [215].  National  programs  to vaccinate young women and men against HPV prior to sexual debut could substantially  reduce  the  burden  of cervical  cancer  and  other HPV-associated malignancies (e.g. anal cancer, head and neck cancer). Studies  of  the  effectiveness  of  HPV  vaccination  in  HIV-infected women are ongoing (www.clinicaltrials.gov).

============================================================
HIV TESTING
Many persons with HIV infection do not get tested until late in their disease [216]. Not only is their access to ART delayed, but they remain unaware that they need to protect their sex or needle-sharing partners from becoming infected. Many HIV-infected persons will decrease risk behaviors when they are aware of their positive HIV status [217, 218]. Medical treatment that lowers plasma HIV viral load also reduces risk for transmission to others [219-221]. An international randomized clinical  trial  demonstrated  that  treating  an  HIV-infected  individual with antiretrovirals can reduce the risk of sexual transmission of HIV to their HIV-uninfected partner by 96% [222].
In countries with generalized epidemics, the WHO recommends HIV testing all persons accessing health care. Testing should be considered a part of the standard of routine clinical care, and patients should be informed that they will be tested for HIV infection and that they can 'opt-out' . The highest priority for testing should be given to persons with  syndromes  that  suggest  HIV  infection  (Table  27-4)  and  to persons  whose  behaviors  or  exposures  substantially  increase  their risk of acquiring HIV, such as persons with other STIs, commercial sex  workers,  IDUs,  MSM,  and  children  whose  mothers  have  HIV infection.
All pregnant women should be tested at their initial antenatal visit. HIV testing can identify women who need their own treatment and who need to receive prenatal prophylaxis to PMTCT of HIV. In the absence of perinatal prophylaxis or interventions to prevent transmission  at  birth  [223-226]  and  through  breastfeeding  [227,  228], approximately 15-40% of infants born to HIV-infected mothers will become infected.  Timely  perinatal  prophylaxis  for  the  mother  and infant,  and  administration  of  ART  to  the  mother  or  infant  while breastfeeding, can reduce the rate to < 1% [39, 52, 229-233].
Clinicians should also consider testing all women during their third trimester or at delivery, especially in regions where the HIV epidemic is  generalized  among  women  of  reproductive  age.  Among  women whose previous testing was negative, re-testing can identify women who have become HIV infected or who were seroconverting. A second HIV test during the third trimester is cost-effective [234, 235].

============================================================
HIV TESTING
HIV-testing should be available and offered to persons in the general population.  Effective  models  have  used  rapid  test  kits  that  allow for  immediate  delivery  of  test  results  and  have  employed  trained lay  counselors  in  settings  with  healthcare  worker  shortages.  In populations with a high HIV prevalence, testing is feasible in rural settings and can be effectively offered by teams going door-to-door [236]. HIV testing results should be presented with counseling about HIV prevention and risk reduction. For persons who test positive, it is critical to provide psychosocial support and clinical services, and to ensure patients are referred to, and linked into, medical care [237] (see ' HIV counseling ' below).

============================================================
CHUNK 52
============================================================
HIV DIAGNOSIS
HIV  infection  should  be  diagnosed  with  a  rapid  or  conventional serologic assay for antibodies against HIV (e.g. an EIA). Rapid HIV testing  is  faster  (tests  results  are  often  available  in  less  than  30 minutes), less costly and increases the number of clients who receive their results [238]. Most rapid tests do not require access to running water or electricity and some can be performed on oral fluids.
Results that are reactive by a serologic assay should be confirmed with another assay. Clinicians should follow local guidelines for confirmatory testing,  which  may involve  repeat HIV testing with  a different rapid EIA test, performing a Western blot for antibodies against specific HIV proteins or an assay that directly detects HIV RNA.
In  low-income settings with a high HIV prevalence, there are algorithms  using  a  series  of  rapid  tests  to  confirm  HIV  infection  (Fig. 27.18). Although HIV serology has sensitivities and specificities that approach 99.9%, false-positive and false-negative results occur. Falsepositive serology is more frequent among persons with autoimmune disease, multiple myeloma, chronic renal failure, in persons recently vaccinated,  in  women  who  have  experienced  multiple  pregnancies and  in  persons  who  have  been  vaccinated  with  a  candidate  HIV vaccine  in  clinical  trials.  Importantly,  in  low-prevalence  situations (e.g. < 0.1% HIV prevalence), even tests with high specificity may yield a relatively high proportion of falsely positive results. False-negative results can occur during acute HIV infection when the person has not yet  developed  detectable  anti-HIV  antibodies  (i.e.  seroconversion), termed the 'window period' . Certain tests can detect HIV RNA and other HIV antigens (e.g. p24) early in infection during this 'window period'; however, there still remains a period of time between infection and the ability to detect the virus, termed the  'eclipse phase' . During  both  the  window  period  and  eclipse  phase,  HIV-infected persons can transmit infection.

============================================================
CHUNK 53
============================================================
HIV DIAGNOSIS
HIV infection in infants and children younger than 18 months cannot be  reliably  diagnosed  with  serology  because  of  the  persistence  of transplacentally acquired maternal antibody [239]. Prompt diagnosis of HIV-infected infants with molecular testing is essential because a high  proportion  (15-20%)  experience  rapid  disease  progression within the first year of life [240]; HIV-infected infants require early initiation of ART and opportunistic infection prophylaxis to survive. Molecular HIV testing of newborns and infants can be performed by either  quantifying HIV RNA or HIV  proviral DNA (preferred if the mother is taking ART). The availability of these tests is limited in lowincome settings.
HIV testing  algorithms should use HIV diagnostic tests that have a high  sensitivity  for  locally  circulating  HIV  subtypes  (clades).  Most HIV EIA tests can detect the vast majority of emerging HIV-1 subtypes and CRFs; certain assays can also detect HIV-1 Group O and N [241245]. Most current EIA tests also detect both HIV-1 and HIV-2, but only  a  few  tests  will  distinguish  between  them.  Patients  whose EIA  suggests  dual  infection  should  be  confirmed  with  HIV-1  and HIV-2 specific RNA testing  or other confirmatory tests.  Many commercial molecular tests can detect and quantify most HIV subtypes; certain assays can quantify group O and N viruses [246, 247]. Falsenegative  molecular  tests,  however,  have  been  reported  with  URFs [248, 249].

HIV COUNSELING
Post-test  counseling  is  necessary  for  all  patients  who  test  positive [237].  Emotional  support  should  be  provided  to  address  issues  of stigma and fear of disclosing one's HIV status. Risk reduction information and the value of male and female condoms should be provided

in non-judgmental language. Ideally, these devices should be made available to the client. Counseling should emphasize that HIV infection can be treated. Patients should be encouraged to disclose their status to trusted family members and friends. Any known sexual or needle-sharing  contacts  should  seek  HIV  testing.  Providers  should also provide referrals to appropriate follow-up services.

INITIAL EVALUATION OF THE NEWLY DIAGNOSED PATIENT
Guidelines and recommendations for the evaluation of HIV-infected adults and children, and for treating and monitoring patients should be  consulted  (Table  27-5)  [140,  250-254].  All  patients  diagnosed need a detailed history, examination and assessment of their social and  economic  circumstances.  Patients  in  resource-limited  settings often  experience  poor  nutritional  status,  inadequate  housing  and limited access to clean water. Such factors increase the susceptibility to  opportunistic  infections.  The  medical  history  should  screen  for opportunistic infections and note any past HIV-related illnesses, other medical  conditions  or  hospitalizations.  A  detailed  sexual  history should review sexual practices, past STIs, obstetric/gynecologic history (including plans for pregnancy), contraceptive use (including condoms), all sexual partners and  recreational  drug use  (including cigarette and alcohol use). The physical exam should be performed with attention to the skin, lymphatic, oral and fundoscopic examination. Women should undergo pelvic examination with assessment for cervical disease by cytology (e.g. Papanicolaou smear) or acetic acid whitening. Baseline laboratory testing typically includes assessment for anemia and abnormalities in liver and kidney function.
Patients should be staged clinically and immunologically. The WHO staging  system  classifies  patients  from  Stage  1  (asymptomatic)  to Stage  4  (life-threatening  opportunistic  infections  or  other  HIVassociated  conditions)  based  on  clinical  and  laboratory  findings (Table 27-4) [103]. Where available, immunologic staging according to the patient's CD4 cell count provides the most accurate assessment of  risk  for  opportunistic  illnesses  and  death. Measurement  of  CD4 cell count is also used to guide initiation of ART and opportunistic infection prophylaxis and to monitor the response to treatment [98]. HIV infection among adults and adolescents aged ≥ 13 years can also be staged according to the 2008 revised CDC surveillance case definitions:  Stage  1  (CD4 + T  lymphocyte  count ≥ 500  cells/ µ l),  Stage  2

HIV RNA viral load measurement and HIV genotypic resistance testing provide information useful for assessing prognosis and optimizing ART regimens. These tests are not widely available in resource-limited settings. In areas with a high burden of tuberculosis, active disease can be present in up to 20-30% of HIV-infected persons receiving clinical care [250].

INITIAL EVALUATION OF NEWLY DIAGNOSED WOMEN OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE
All newly diagnosed women of reproductive age should be assessed for  pregnancy and, if  pregnant, referred for ART and counseling to prevent perinatal HIV transmission to their infant [256]. Clinicians should  query  non-pregnant  women  regarding  their  intentions  for future pregnancies and provide contraceptive counseling. Use of dual methods (i.e. hormonal contraception combined with male or female condoms) may be appropriate in some settings. HIV-infected women who  are  contemplating  pregnancy  should  receive  pre-conception counseling (e.g. eliminating alcohol and cigarette smoking, folic acid supplementation) and counseling regarding the risk for HIV transmission to their infant. HIV-infected women on ART who are contemplating  pregnancy  should  not  take  potentially  teratogenic  drugs  (i.e. efavirenz) and should attain a stable, suppressed maternal viral load prior to conception [257].

INTRODUCTION
Expert guidance on ART is available from the WHO, the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the International AIDS Society-USA,  the  British  HIV  Association,  and  the  European  AIDS Clinical Society (Table 27-6). Most resource-limited countries develop specific national guidance.
Combination ART became the standard of care in developed nations following its introduction in 1996. However, in resource-limited settings, few had access to these life-saving drugs. Starting in the early 2000s, governments, the private sector, human rights advocates and other  stakeholders  have  reduced  the  cost  of  ART  and  initiated  the

GOALS OF ART
The goal of ART is to maximally suppress HIV replication and improve the  health  of  the  individual.  Improving  the  survival  of  young  and middle-aged adults reduces the number of orphaned children and is associated with improved economic outcomes [258]. At the individual level, ART is associated with a reduction in sexual transmission of HIV from an HIV-infected individual to their HIV-uninfected partner [222]. At the population level, reduction of the viral load of the community of HIV-infected persons leads to decreases in new HIV infections [259, 260].

============================================================
ART: WHEN TO START
ART should be initiated  in persons  who have developed an AIDSrelated opportunistic infection or illness (WHO Stage 4 or CDC Stage 3 illness), who have symptoms of advanced HIV disease (WHO Stage 3 illness) or who have a CD4 cell count < 200 cells/ μ l (CDC Stage 3 illness) (Tables 27-4 and 27-5). HIV-infected persons with CD4 cell counts < 200  cells/ μ l  can  be  asymptomatic  for  prolonged  periods before developing a WHO clinical indication for treatment, thus, it is important to assess the CD4 cell count. The introduction of simplified formulations (e.g. once or twice daily combination pills), more tolerable  and  durable  medications,  and  antiretrovirals  that  target  new steps  in  HIV's  lifecycle  (e.g.  integrase  inhibitors,  CCR5  inhibitors) have  improved  treatment  options  during  earlier  stages  of  disease (i.e.  at  higher  CD4  cell  counts).  Observational cohort  studies  have also demonstrated that initiation of continuous ART at higher CD4 cell  counts  improves  survival,  increases  AIDS-free  survival,  reduces non-AIDS  associated  outcomes  (e.g.  end-organ  disease)  [261-263] and  may  help  control  inflammatory  responses  related  to  chronic HIV infection [262-264]. A randomized trial in Haiti confirmed that initiation of ART and CD4 cell counts ≤ 350 cells/ μ L was associated with lower mortality and lower rates of tuberculosis than initiation at  a  CD4  cell  count  of  200  cells/ μ l  [265].  Definitive  randomized controlled trials of starting ART at even higher CD4 cell counts are underway [details can be found at: www.clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier: NCT00867048) or at http://insight.ccbr.umn.edu/start/].
As  of  201 1,  the  WHO  recommends  treating  all  patients  with  CD4 counts of ≤ 350 cells/ μ l,  irrespective  of  their  WHO  clinical  stage  of disease  [141].  Multiple  guidelines  from  developed  countries  have

moved the CD4 cell count threshold for ART initiation to 350-500 cells/ μ l and some recommend ART at any CD4 cell count as soon as HIV infection  is  diagnosed  considering  the  harmful  impact  of  ongoing HIV replication [98, 139, 140, 266]. The initiation of ART at CD4  cell  count > 350  cells/ μ L  in  resource-limited  settings  will  be problematic until there is the availability of more options for secondline regimens when resistance to first-line ART develops.

ART: Initiating Therapy for Women of Reproductive Age
Most HIV-infected women and men remain sexually active, and many continue to have children or to not use any form of contraception [267-269]. Women of reproductive age presenting for care must be assessed for pregnancy before starting therapy and referred for contraceptive counseling if not pregnant (see ' Initial evaluation of newly diagnosed women of reproductive age ' above). ART should be offered to pregnant women with HIV infection who need it for their own health and started as early as possible in pregnancy for PMTCT.

============================================================
ART: WHAT TO START
More than 20 antiretroviral drugs are commercially available. Antiretrovirals are characterized within five drug classes according to their mechanism  of  action  (Table  27-7).  The  oldest,  and  most  widely used,  drugs  against  HIV  are  nucleoside/nucleotide  analogues  that inhibit  HIV  reverse  transcriptase  (NRTIs).  Non-nucleoside  reversetranscriptase  inhibitors  (NNRTIs)  target  reverse-transcriptase  but are  structurally  dissimilar  to  endogenous  nucleosides,  and  to  each other.  Protease  inhibitors  inhibit  the  HIV  protease  and  interrupt assembly of the mature virion. Protease inhibitors are typically coadministered with a low dose (e.g. 100 mg) of the protease inhibitor ritonavir that 'boosts' the serum concentration of the other protease inhibitors by inhibiting their hepatic metabolism. Integrase inhibitors target HIV's integrase enzyme and block integration of HIV DNA into the host  genome. Entry inhibitors  block  entry  of HIV  into the cell and  include  fusion  inhibitors  and  agents  that  block  the  CCR5 co-receptor. As of 201 1, this class is not available in most resourcelimited settings.
Since 2002, the WHO has recommended use of standardized treatment regimens in resource-limited settings with reduced frequency of monitoring compared with high-income countries [141, 270]. Table 27-8 lists combinations of first-line antiretrovirals recommended by the WHO [141]. Standardization of treatment simplifies training of clinicians, medication dispensers (e.g. pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and technologists), counselors, and community workers. There are also standards for treatment during pregnancy and co-infection with tuberculosis (for special considerations in patients with tuberculosis see Chapter 39, ' Tuberculosis ') or hepatitis B.

ART: What to Start-Special Considerations for Women Previously Given Antiretroviral Drugs as Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT) of HIV
Women  who  require  PMTCT  should  be  given  highly  active  triple combination ART; this strategy reduces the risk of perinatal HIV transmission  and  minimizes  development  of  resistance.  In  resourcelimited settings, many programs have used only one or two drugs. Antiretroviral resistance can emerge under these circumstances [271], particularly resistance to lamivudine [272] and nevirapine [273, 274]. The resistance mutation to lamivudine confers increased susceptibility of HIV to other NRTIs. Thus, if this is the sole mutation present, then lamivudine can be used in combination with other NRTIs to treat mothers and their HIV-infected infants. Women who can wait at least one year after having received nevirapine prophylaxis for PMTCT respond  as  well  to  NNRTI-containing  highly  active  antiretroviral therapy (HAART), as women who had not been exposed to nevirapine  [275-282].  However,  if  less  than  a  year  has  passed,  a  protease inhibitor-based regimen is  preferred [283].  Antiretroviral  resistance testing should be conducted for all women and HIV-infected infants

ART: What to Start-Special Considerations for Pregnant Women
The NNRTIs nevirapine and efavirenz are both effective antiretroviral agents for pregnant women. Efavirenz has been associated with potential teratogenicity [284]; some guidelines recommend against its use during the first trimester of pregnancy [257], though others consider the risk of teratogenicity to be small enough to allow for its use [266]. Rash  and  life-threatening  hepatotoxicity  have  been  associated  with nevirapine in women with CD4 cell counts > 250 cells/ μ l [285, 286]. However, clinical experience has been reassuring regarding the safety of nevirapine in women in resource-limited settings who have CD4 cell counts > 250 cells/ μ l [287]. Nonetheless, pregnant women starting nevirapine should be counseled about the risk of rash and hepatotoxicity, and advised to seek immediate evaluation if problems occur.

ART: What to Start-Special Considerations in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Infection
Patients  with  HBV  and  HIV  co-infection  are  at  increased  risk  for chronic HBV and its complications [288]; earlier initiation of ART is associated with a reduction in liver disease (see ' Select Major Opportunistic Infections-Viral Hepatitis ' above). Several antiretroviral agents, including lamivudine, emtricitabine, and tenofovir, are active against both HIV and HBV. Selecting ART that contains two of these agents, such as tenofovir with emtricitabine or lamivudine, is recommended [98, 139-141]. Inclusion of a single agent with dual HIV and HBV activity is not recommended as it may not suppress HBV replication and can increase the risk of HBV drug resistance.

============================================================
CHUNK 70
============================================================
ART: ADHERENCE TO THERAPY
Adherence, including retention in care, is a cornerstone of effective ART  [289-291].  Aspects  of  ART  that  make  adherence  difficult  are: pill burden; complexity of regimens; side effects; patient knowledge and  attitudes;  distance  from  the  clinic;  transportation  costs;  userfriendliness  of  the  services;  competing  priorities  (e.g.  employment, child  care);  mental  illness  (e.g.  depression,  addiction);  and  social instability. Systems issues, such as inadequate supplies and stockouts, can also lead to nonadherence. Suboptimal adherence is associated with  treatment  failure  (e.g.  viral  breakthroughs,  lower  CD4  cell counts, increased mortality) and can lead to viral resistance.
All patients should receive adherence counseling at initiation of treatment. The WHO recommends client-centered counseling, pillboxes, and treatment supporters [141, 250]. As part of this counseling, the provider  should  assess  readiness  to  commit  to  lifelong  treatment,
identify  barriers  to  adherence  and  options  to  overcome  them,  and provide resources for assistance [292, 293].
Training healthcare personnel and community workers as treatment supporters can be facilitated if there is a set of essential messages. For advanced  disease,  improved  health  with  ART  (e.g.  weight  gain, increased strength, improved social functioning) can provide positive reinforcement. For those with less symptomatic disease, side effects are a challenge, especially if the patient experiences minimal improvements in their perceived wellbeing. Adherence can be improved if the health workers, and patient, understand what to expect after initiating ART and how to differentiate  minor  side  effects  from  more  severe events that require clinical evaluation.
Initiatives to maximize retention in care should identify persons who have  lapsed  (e.g.  missed  clinic  visits,  missed  pharmacy  refills)  and reach out to those patients in the community [294]. Successful interventions have ranged from community workers making home visits to the  use  of  cell  phones  and  text  messaging that  enable  staff at  a central  clinic  to  contact  patients  and  community  workers.  Refilling antiretroviral medications more regularly (a proxy for adherence to medications and retention in care) has been associated with improved virologic response and survival [295-297]. It is important to retain persons who do not yet qualify for ART, but who need regular visits for  CD4  count  testing  and  other  benefits  such  as  cotrimoxazole prophylaxis [298].

============================================================
CHUNK 71
============================================================
ART: MONITORING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ART
recognizing that access to laboratory capacity can be limited. Where laboratory testing is available, guidelines recommend measuring the CD4 cell count at initiation of ART and at least twice a year thereafter. Monitoring  CD4  cell  counts  provides  prognostic  information  and informs the use of opportunistic illness prophylaxis. Although adding CD4 cell counts to clinical monitoring improves outcomes [300, 301], discordant responses (e.g. viral load suppression without an accompanying increase in the CD4 cell count) can occur in 20% or more of patients [302].
Monitoring plasma HIV RNA viral load is controversial. Most authorities  recommend  HIV RNA viral  load testing, although  in  resourcelimited settings, adding this to routine patient monitoring does not improve outcomes [300, 303]. HIV RNA viral load provides the most direct measure of antiretroviral effectiveness and can indirectly assess adherence. Confirming virologic failure rather than poor adherence generally requires a repeat test. In developed countries, genotypic or phenotypic antiretroviral resistance testing is recommended prior to starting treatment and as needed during treatment to optimize ART in patients who are virologically failing [98, 304]. The WHO's standardized  approach  to  second-line  ART  for  resource-limited  settings limits the need for HIV-resistance testing by making treatment recommendations based on the assumption that prior treatment could have induced resistance.

ART: MONITORING FOR TOLERABILITY
The WHO recommends a minimum standard for monitoring clinical response to ART [141, 299]. Immunologic (i.e. CD4 cell count) and virologic (i.e. HIV RNA viral load) monitoring are not emphasized,
Antiretroviral drugs  have early and  late-onset side effects that can affect tolerance. Some side effects, such as headache and nausea, are  common  at  treatment  initiation  but  are  usually  transient  and manageable.  Table  27-9  lists  some  of  the  most  common  severe antiretroviral side effects.

Directed  assessments  for  adverse  events  (e.g.  questionnaires  that review specific signs and symptoms, monofilament testing for peripheral neuropathy) can help ensure that early side effects are identified when it is possible to change therapy to prevent their progression. As ART continues, the frequency of assessment can be decreased. It is not currently possible to identify which patients will develop side effects; however, the risk  for ART-related events  may be greater in  patients with more advanced disease [305-307].

============================================================
CHUNK 75
============================================================
ART: MONITORING FOR TOLERABILITY
If available, routine laboratory monitoring is an important adjunct to care  and  can  be used to  monitor  for ART-associated  toxicities  (e.g. liver  enzymes  to  assess  for  nevirapine-associated  hepatotoxicity, hemoglobin to assess for zidovudine-associated anemia). Laboratory monitoring, however, is not a prerequisite for the initiation of ART [141]. In high-income settings, guidelines typically recommend quarterly or semi-annual testing of complete blood counts, serum chemistries and urinalyses, as well as CD4 cell count and plasma HIV RNA viral load [98]. If resources are limited, laboratory testing should be directed by clinical signs and symptoms (see Table 27-9) [141]. The WHO also recommends testing that is tailored to the ART (e.g. creatinine clearance for tenofovir) [141].
Most patients with advanced HIV disease starting ART experience a return to health with improvements in functional status and laboratory parameters. However, high early mortality during the first 3-6 months of treatment has been observed among persons with advanced disease in resource-limited settings [308, 309]. Contributors to early mortality include undiagnosed or untreated opportunistic infection, IRIS, and severe malnutrition [310].

CHUNK 76
============================================================
ART: METABOLIC COMPLICATIONS DURING TREATMENT
ART has been associated with the  development of metabolic complications:  abnormal changes  in body fat distribution  (lipoatrophy and lipoaccumulation), serum dyslipidemias, insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, and osteopenia [31 1]. Many metabolic complications increase the risk for chronic medical conditions (e.g. myocardial infarction, stroke, hepatic and renal failure, fragility bone fracture), and some, particularly lipodystrophy, can impair the quality of life. In industrialized nations, the care of HIV-infected persons is increasingly dominated by management of these complications.

============================================================
CHUNK 77
============================================================
ART: WHEN TO CHANGE ART
The goal of ART is to maintain maximal suppression of HIV replication  for  as  long  as  possible  and  to  change  therapy  when  virologic failure occurs. Adherence should always be assessed. HIV RNA viral loads should be obtained at least every 6 months [98, 141]. However, where laboratory resources are limited, clinicians can limit HIV RNA viral load testing to confirm virologic failure when there is a declining CD4 cell count or clinical change in a person's health.
Clinicians  should  strive  to  maintain  HIV  RNA  viral  load  below the limit of detection for the assay (usually < 50 copies/ml) [98]. In resource-limited settings, a more lenient approach to virologic suppression has been advocated [141], with virologic failure defined as a  plasma  HIV  RNA  concentration > 5000  copies/ml  after  at  least 6 months of treatment. This allows programs with limited formularies to  treat  more  patients  and  limit  switching  to  costly  second-  or third-line  regimens.  Low-level  viral  replication  in  the  presence  of ART, however,  increases the risk  of  developing  ART  resistance [312-314].
The occurrence of an AIDS-defining illness or a decline in CD4 count below a threshold (e.g. fall to baseline value or lower, 50% fall from on-treatment  peak  value,  CD4  cell  count  persistently  below  100 cells/ μ l)  in  a  patient  who  had  demonstrated  clinical  improvement after  initiating  ART  suggests  a  need  to  change  treatment.  Some patients who initiate ART demonstrate no clinical improvement after a sufficient course of ART (e.g. 6 months). In this situation, the patient may have been infected with a strain with primary resistance.

============================================================
CHUNK 78
============================================================
ART: HOW TO CHANGE (SWITCH) ART
If genotypic or phenotypic antiretroviral resistance testing is available, clinicians should optimize regimens according to those results [312]. Resistance testing should be obtained while the patient is taking the failing antiretroviral regimen or shortly after treatment discontinuation. If the first-line regimen consisted of two NRTIs combined with an NNRTI, a reasonable second-line regimen would consist of a ritonavir-boosted  protease  inhibitor  combined  with  two  new  NRTIs. Importantly, for HIV-infected patients who have chronic active hepatitis  B  infection,  the  second-line  and  subsequent  regimens  should maintain two antiretrovirals with activity against hepatitis B.

============================================================
CHUNK 79
============================================================
ART FOR CHILDREN
For perinatally infected children, ART should be started  within  the first few months of life as, without treatment, opportunistic illnesses and death can occur very early. ART may need to be initiated in infants with a presumptive diagnosis of severe HIV disease (criteria are published  by  the  WHO  at:  http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/guidelines/art/ en/), as access to infant diagnosis (i.e. HIV proviral DNA testing) may not be available (see ' HIV Diagnosis ' above) [239, 315]. These infants must be closely monitored and must have their HIV diagnosis confirmed as soon as possible (at the latest, with HIV antibody testing at 18 months of age) [316]. In all settings, pediatric ART has been complicated by the lack of approved drugs in child-friendly formulations (e.g.  liquid  products). As  children grow,  dosages must be adjusted. Some manufacturers have produced child-friendly tablets at pediatric dosages  in  fixed-dose  combination  tablets  that  are  scored  for  easy splitting and are dispersible in water [317-320].
Perinatally infected children can be at greater risk of infection with strains of HIV that have primary resistance to antiretrovirals that the mother has taken for PMTCT. Treating all HIV-infected mothers with triple antiretroviral prophylaxis for PMTCT creates a barrier to transmitting drug-resistant infection [256]. Drug resistance can also emerge in  HIV-infected  children  administered  extended-prophylaxis  with nevirapine (with or without concomitant zidovudine) during breastfeeding [321, 322] or if exposed to antiretroviral drugs through breastfeeding  when  their  mothers  are  taking  ART  [323].  Lamivudine, nevirapine, efavirenz, but not zidovudine, are transmitted in biologically significant concentrations via breast milk [257].

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR ANTIMICROBIAL PROPHYLAXIS IN RESOURCE-LIMITED SETTINGS
[Note isoniazid prophylaxis is discussed in Chapter 39, ' Tuber  culosis ' .]

============================================================
CHUNK 81
============================================================
Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole/ Cotrimoxazole
In  resource-limited  settings,  daily  prophylaxis  with  trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole (cotrimoxazole) in adults and children reduces the incidence  of  pneumonia,  diarrhea,  malaria,  and  bacterial  bloodstream infections [324-327], and reduces mortality in areas with high prevalences of malaria [326] and in persons with both HIV and active tuberculosis [325]. Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis is also beneficial for persons  initiating  ART  [328-330].  The  intervention  has  additional benefits in pregnant women and reduces the rate of low birth weight in newborns [331].
The WHO strongly recommends cotrimoxazole prophylaxis for HIVinfected  persons,  including  children  and  pregnant  women  [332]. Countries may tailor its provision according to stage of disease (e.g. all  HIV-infected  persons  vs.  only  persons  with  advanced  disease). Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis increases pill burden and costs modestly, but  is well-tolerated and  is cost-effective [333-335].  It  creates
selection pressure leading to cotrimoxazole-resistant infections among a small number of individuals [336]; however, its use has been associated  with  decreases  in  overall  rates  of  sulfa-resistant  malaria [337].  Cotrimoxazole  prophylaxis  against Pneumocystis pneumonia can  be  safely  discontinued  in  individuals  who  maintain  CD4  cell counts > 200  cells/ μ l  for > 3  months  [1 15].  It  is  less  clear  whether cotrimoxazole in resource-limited settings should be discontinued; a marked increase in the risk of malaria and diarrheal disease following its discontinuation has been demonstrated [338].

============================================================

============================================================
Fluconazole and Itraconazole
Randomized clinical trials conducted in the USA, Uganda, and Thailand  demonstrated  that  primary  prophylaxis  with  fluconazole  or itraconazole reduces the incidence of cryptococcal disease in adults with  advanced  HIV  disease,  particularly  those  with  CD4  counts < 50-100 cells/ μ l [129, 339-343], and, in one trial, improved survival [340].  Primary  prophylaxis  is  not  recommended  in  high-income countries with a low prevalence of cryptococcosis [1 15] but may be beneficial  in  countries  with  a  high  prevalence  of  azole-susceptible fungal opportunistic illness (e.g. cryptococcosis, penicilliosis) [250]. Fluconazole can also reduce the risk of recurrent candidal infections but the benefits are felt to be outweighed by cost and concerns about induction of fluconazole resistance [250]. Because of possible teratogenicity,  women  prescribed  azoles  should  take  effective  birth control [344].

Non-Tuberculosis Anti-Mycobacterials [ Mycobacterium Avium Complex (MAC)]
Prophylaxis against Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) is recommended in developed countries for HIV-infected adults with CD4 cell counts < 50 cell/ μ l [1 15]. The organism is ubiquitous in the environment  worldwide  [345-347].  However,  MAC  infections  have  not emerged  as  a  substantial  cause  of  disease  in  HIV-infected  persons outside of North and South America and Europe. Primary prophylaxis against MAC is not addressed in WHO guidelines [141].

NON-PHARMACOLOGIC INTERVENTIONS
Insecticide-treated bed nets or indoor residual spraying for mosquitoes can prevent malaria, especially the associated risk for placental infection and its complications. Interventions to improve point-of-use water  safety  and  hand  hygiene (e.g.  latrines,  soap-and-water  handwashing) can decrease the risk of diarrheal disease at both the family, clinic and community levels. Reducing the burden of tuberculosis in persons  with  HIV  should  also  include  infection  control  measures, such as early triage and separation of persons with suspected tuberculosis and efforts to optimize ventilation [348].

Smoking Cessation
Adult male prevalence estimates for daily cigarette smoking in 2006 ranged from 4-27% for countries in Africa, 18-57% for countries in Asia, and 2-39% for countries in the Americas [348]. In many countries, rates of tobacco smoking in HIV-infected adults are substantially higher  than  rates  in  the  general  population  [196,  349-35 1].  HIVinfected adults are at increased risk of many diseases for which the burden  is  greater  in  tobacco  smokers:  cardiovascular  disease  (e.g. myocardial infarction), pulmonary disease (e.g. bacterial pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), tuberculosis [352]), and cancer (e.g. lung cancer) [348]. Smoking cessation is among the most  cost-effective  interventions  for  reducing  long-term  morbidity and mortality for HIV-infected persons [353].

Mental Health
Mental health conditions, such as depression and substance abuse, are  common  among  people  with  HIV,  reduce  quality  of  life  and present  challenges  to  adherence  and  retention  in  care  [354].  All patients  should  be  screened  for  mood  and  thought  disorders,  and drug and alcohol dependency.

Safety is a concern with some live virus vaccines and their use should be avoided when possible, especially in persons with CD4 cell counts < 200 cells/ μ l. Generally, vaccinations are more immunogenic in persons with higher CD4 cell counts. For persons in whom immune reconstitution is anticipated and vaccine resources are limited, vaccination can be deferred until the CD4 cell count has improved (e.g. ≥ 200 cells/ μ l).  Persons with low CD4 cell counts can be vaccinated at entry to care, and then reassessed once their CD4 cell count has improved and be revaccinated if warranted.

Nutrition
Food insecurity, inadequate energy intake, malnutrition, and specific micronutrient deficiencies are endemic in many areas with high HIV prevalence [359-362]. The diet and nutritional status of people living with HIV should be routinely assessed. In developed nations where patients have had long-standing access to ART, 'return to health' has been  associated  with  increased  rates  of  obesity  [363].  For  patients whose  expected  lifespan  has  increased  significantly,  dietary  counseling and exercise promotion are indicated.

PRIMARY HIV PREVENTION
Comprehensive,  sustained  prevention  programs  can  reduce  HIV transmission [364]; however, interventions do not reach most people at risk. Successful behavioral interventions engage high-risk populations and offer educational messages coupled with prevention skills, such as how to negotiate condom use and how to refuse sex.
HIV testing is an important component of primary HIV prevention as half of all persons living with HIV worldwide are unaware of their status [365]. Offering opt-out HIV testing in most clinical settings (e.g. antenatal clinics, pediatric and adult general medicine clinics, inpatients settings) has been widely recommended. Couples testing and counseling is acceptable in high-risk populations where transmission is predominately heterosexual [216]. Couples testing can be linked to ART of an HIV-infected partner, which can reduce transmission to the HIV-negative partner by as much as 96% through suppression of viral load [221, 222, 366].
A safe and effective HIV vaccine would be a major advance and is the subject of intense research efforts [367]. Male circumcision reduces a man's risk of acquiring HIV heterosexually by 50-60% [43-45]. In high prevalence areas where a large fraction of the regional population is uncircumcised, large-scale implementation of male circumcision has the potential to prevent many new infections.

PRIMARY HIV PREVENTION
Interventions that women can control, such as vaginal microbicides containing antiretrovirals, have shown early promise (39% reduction in HIV incidence) [368], and are the subject of intense investigation. Daily  oral  administration  of  antiretroviral  drugs  to  high-risk,  HIVnegative  individuals,  termed  'pre-exposure  prophylaxis',  has  been demonstrated in one trial to prevent HIV infection among MSM (44% reduction in HIV incidence) [369]. Trials among heterosexual men and women have also demonstrated an HIV prevention benefit from pre-exposure prophylaxis in Botswana (62% reduction in HIV incidence) and in Kenya and Uganda (67-75% reduction in HIV incidence)  [370,  371].  Higher  levels  of  protection  were  observed  with more  consistent  use  of  pre-exposure  prophylaxis  in  these  trials. However, another trial conducted in Kenya, South Africa, and Tanzania  among  high-risk,  HIV-negative  women  failed  to  demonstrate benefit; it is likely that low overall adherence contributed to the lack of  efficacy,  though  other  contributing  factors  may  have  made  preexposure prophylaxis less effective [372].

============================================================
PREVENTION WITH POSITIVES
Interventions  that  help  patients  maintain  their  health  and  reduce their risk of transmitting, often termed 'prevention with positives', play a critical role in HIV prevention [216]. Maintaining a suppressed plasma HIV viral load reduces their infectiousness to others. Use of male and female condoms and clean needles for IDUs prevents exposure of uninfected persons to HIV and reduces the likelihood that an HIV-infected person could become infected with a resistant strain of HIV (termed 'superinfection'). Encouraging patients to reduce their number of sexual partners, to disclose their HIV status, to encourage their partners to be tested and to use lubrication during intercourse can further reduce HIV transmission risk. Screening and treating for STIs may reduce their infectiousness to others [137].

PALLIATIVE CARE
Although there has been a 14% decline in the number of HIV-related deaths worldwide from 2004 to 2009, an estimated 1.8 million HIVrelated  deaths  still  occurred  in  2009  [1].  Palliative  care  focuses  on improving the quality of life of patients with life-threatening illnesses and  helping  patients  live  as  actively  as  possible  until  death  [373]. Palliative care can be offered throughout the course of HIV infection, not only at end-of-life situations. It can be provided in a healthcare setting or at home by family and community caregivers. Important goals are: (i) to provide relief from pain and other distressing symptoms  (i.e.  diarrhea,  nausea,  shortness  of  breath)  which  can  be common with  advanced HIV disease  and  opportunistic  infections; and (ii) to provide support for the psychological, social, spiritual and cultural needs of the patient and family, including bereavement care. For pain relief, an analgesic ladder with three standard drugs is usually recommended and includes a non-opioid (e.g. aspirin or paracetamol),  a  weak  opioid  (e.g.  codeine,  dextropropoxyphene  or  methadone), and a strong opioid (e.g. morphine). Detailed guidelines on palliative care have been developed by the WHO [374].
