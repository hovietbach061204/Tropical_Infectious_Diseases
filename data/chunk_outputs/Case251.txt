Neurologic diseases present different challenges in the tropics:
- those that relate to sanitation (e.g., typhoid) or arthropods (e.g., cerebral malaria)
- neuropathies)
- chronic diseases (hypertension, obesity, diabetes) without the necessary public health campaigns and measures to limit them
- (polio, diphtheria, tetanus)
- traditional medicines and healers and psychiatric diagnoses as witchcraft
The  number  of  infectious  and  non-infectious  causes  of neurologic presentation is large (T able 10.1). In this chapter, for  each  of  the  key  presenting  neurologic  syndromes,  the clinical approach, investigation, diagnosis, and management are considered.

Key Syndromes and Clinical Approach
Meningism is the clinical syndrome of headache, neck stiffness, and  photophobia,  often  with  nausea  and  vomiting. 1 It  is  most often  caused  by  in|ammation  of  the  meninges  (see  later),  but other causes include raised intracranial pressure. Kernig's sign is present if, with the patient supine and the hip and knee |exed, extension of the knee causes pain in the back and neck.
Brudzinski's sign is positive if passive |exion of the neck causes knee  and  hip  |exion.  Both  signs  have  low  sensitivity  but  high speci{city for meningitis.
Meningitis is in|ammation of the meninges. Bacterial, viral, and fungal infections are the most common causes, but meningitis can also be caused by carcinoma and drugs. Fever, neck stiffness, and altered consciousness are described as the 'classic triad,' but they are only found in about half of adults with acute bacterial meningitis. 2 The term meningoencephalitis is used by some clinicians to describe patients with meningitis and altered consciousness but by other clinicians to describe patients with meningitis or encephalitis. Therefore it is probably best avoided.
In the history and examination, pay particular attention to the presence of rash (meningococcus), macules or vesicles on the hands and feet and mouth ulcers (enterovirus causing hand-foot-andmouth disease), buccal lesions (enterovirus), and otitis (pneumococcal meningitis). Ask about possible contact with tuberculosis (TB) or whether there is an outbreak of mumps in the community, for

Approaches to Investigation, Diagnosis, and Management
The cardinal investigation in diagnosing meningitis and determining its underlying cause is the lumbar puncture (LP). In high-income countries where computed tomography (CT) scanning is readily available, this is sometimes performed before the LP if there are clinical  features  suggesting  the  possibility  of  brain  shift,  which could be made worse by an LP (Box 10.2). It is used less often in lower- and middle-income countries. If all the equipment is not available for LP , it can be fashioned out of readily available items (Box 10.3).
After LP, most patients will be classi{ed as having normal cerebrospinal |uid (CSF), or CSF consistent with viral meningitis,  bacterial  meningitis,  or  tuberculous  meningitis  (Box 10.4);  in  some  patients  a  microorganism  will  have  been  seen on CSF microscopy, thus guiding treatment. If CSF is consistent with acute bacterial meningitis, empirical antibiotics (usually a third-generation  cephalosporin)  are  started. These  should  be started immediately if bacterial meningitis is suspected and there will  be  delays  before  the  LP  can  be  performed.  If  the  initial CSF {ndings suggest tuberculosis meningitis (TBM), microbiologic  con{rmation  requires  large  volumes  of  CSF  (e.g., 6-10 mL);  therefore  unless  the  patient  is  very  unwell,  it  is worth waiting 24 hours to repeat an LP removing large CSF volumes. Cartridge-based automated polymerase chain reaction CSF for TB diagnosis,  are  more  sensitive,  and  can  also  give immediate information on rifampicin resistance. 3 It is important to  remember  that  the  differential  diagnosis  of  meningitis  is broad (Table 10.2).
There has been controversy for many years over the role of corticosteroids in treating acute bacterial meningitis. A meta-analysis of  data  from  {ve  studies,  including  two  from  Malawi  and  one from Vietnam, showed that dexamethasone did not reduce deaths or neurologic sequelae; a sub-group analysis showed it did reduce death and the composite analysis of death, neurologic sequelae, and severe hearing loss in patients over 55 years old. 4 This is in contrast  to  TBM,  where  corticosteroids  are  thought  to  be  of bene{t. 5

BOX 10.2 Lumbar Puncture Guidelines
All patients with a suspected CNS infection should have a lumbar puncture (LP) as soon as possible, unless there are contraindications. In Western industrialized settings, LP use declined somewhat in the 1990s, after concerns that it might precipitate brain shift and herniation syndromes in patients with incipient herniation. In the West, a CT scan is therefore recommended before LP in patients with clinical features suggestive of incipient herniation; while this is performed, appropriate antimicrobial therapy is started and an LP is performed as soon as it is deemed safe. If imaging shows no significant brain shift, lumbar puncture should be performed.
In lower- and middle-income countries where CT is less readily available and infections are more common, the benefits of accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment are often felt to outweigh the theoretical risk of herniation, and even patients with a relative contraindication often undergo an LP with no apparent harm. Imaging is indicated before the LP, if:
- falling level of consciousness
- Other contraindications to immediate LP:

Encephalitis is in|ammation of the brain parenchyma, often due  to  infection;  strictly  speaking,  this  can  only  be  diagnosed pathologically, with biopsy or autopsy.  Because of the  practical limitations  of  this,  surrogate  markers  are  used,  such  as  CSF pleocytosis, or in|ammatory change on imaging. Infectious causes of encephalitis include viruses and some bacteria, particularly small, intracellular bacteria. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis causes include limbic encephalitis associated with systemic neoplasms. Increasingly, autoimmune encephalitis is being recognized, especially that associated with antibodies against the N-methylcomplex. Clinically, encephalitis usually presents with a history of  |u-like  illness  followed  by  altered  consciousness  and  severe headache; in children there are often seizures and, depending on the type and cause of encephalitis, there may be focal signs. Japanese encephalitis is often associated with tremors and other signs of parkinsonism. Herpes simplex encephalitis may be associated with olfactory hallucinations.

For assessing depth of coma in adults and children over the under the age of 5, a range of scores are used, including the Alert, Blantyre Coma Scale (Box 10.7).
A careful history and examination greatly assist the classi{cation of patients presenting with altered consciousness. Consider evidence for HIV infection or other immunocompromise (see Box 10.1). In the history pay attention to:
- brainstem cerebrovascular accidents or subarachnoid hemorrhage; if preceded by hemispheric signs, then intracerebral hemorrhage

- medulla), which may indicate a syndrome of cerebral herniation through the tentorial hiatus or the foramen  magnum (Box 10.8; Fig. 10.1).

Essential  blood  tests in  encephalopathic  patients include blood sugar  (hypoglycemia),  a  peripheral  blood  smear  ( Plasmodium falciparum ), and full blood count (leukocytosis in bacterial infection, leukopenia in some viral infections).
CSF examination is extremely helpful. If patients are mildly encephalopathic with only a moderate reduction in coma score, LP can proceed without imaging (see Box 10.2). If patients have brainstem signs, hemispheric signs, or deep coma, imaging before LP is preferred where possible.  A CT scan may reveal the cause in patients with supratentorial or hemispheric signs; it is less helpful

If there is papilledema or clinical signs of raised intracranial pressure and brain shift, mannitol or hypertonic saline is often given. Although there is little evidence for or against many conditions, data from children with cerebral malaria suggest that mannitol gives a transient reduction in pressure, but overuse can ultimately result in raised pressure. 6 A multi-center study in Africa showed that bolus administration of |uid in children with a febrile illness and impaired perfusion (including those with coma) increased mortality. 7

EPILEPSY
Epilepsy is a major cause of neurodisability in the tropics. The incidence is increased as a result of infectious causes, such as cysticercosis, and head trauma and cerebral palsy. Nodding syndrome is an epidemic of epilepsy with atonic seizures that has increased to be due to the immune reaction to onchocerciasis. 8,9
Common epilepsy syndromes in the tropics include:
- cerebral palsy or developmental delay.
In many settings, the only drugs available are phenytoin, phenobarbitone, sodium valproate, and carbamazepine. Management is often complicated by local superstition about what causes epilepsy (curses,  witchcraft,  etc.)  and  poor  access  to  health  care.  Severe burns,  secondary  to  falling  into  an  open  {re,  are  a  common complication of epilepsy in many parts of the tropics. The management of status epilepticus is covered in Box 10.10. 10

In addition, stroke in younger people is especially common, possibly because of the increased incidence of HIV.
Infectious  space-occupying  lesions  may  cause  hemiparesis, altered consciousness, dementia, or meningism depending on their etiology, location, speed of onset, and the host response (see Box 10.13). They are especially important in the immunocompromised. Brain imaging is an essential investigation in such patients.

HIV, leprosy, drugs, toxins, and nutritional de{ciencies, although the complete list is much longer (Box 10.14). Identifying drug, toxin, and nutritional causes rapidly is important, as it will obviate the need for extensive investigations, and removal of the offending drug or toxin will stop progression and result in recovery if identi{ed early enough. Similarly, treatment with the appropriate vitamins and nutrients will stop progression and help with recovery, although this may not be complete. Nowadays, and especially in the tropics, HIV , which can affect all areas of the neuro-axis, including nerve and muscle, features high on every list of differential diagnosis. Furthermore, as much of the developing world has a growing middle class who less exercise, diabetes and obesity are an increasing problem with the well-known consequences.

Peripheral Neuropathic Syndromes
Sensory symptoms include positive symptoms, such as pins and needles (paresthesias); burning, sharp shooting, or stabbing pains;
Fig. 10.2 Peripheral nervous system (PNS). The PNS consists of all of the neural elements outside of the central nervous system (CNS; brain and spinal cord) and provides the connections between the CNS and all other body organ systems. The PNS consists of somatic and autonomic components. The somatic component innervates skeletal muscle and skin and is shown here. The somatic component of the peripheral nerves contains both motor and sensory axons. Cell bodies of the motor neurons are found in the anterior horn gray matter, whereas the cell bodies of sensory neurons are located in the dorsal root ganglia.

Examination  of  patients  with  peripheral  nerve  disorders  or radiculopathies  may  reveal  evidence  of  a 'lower  motor  neuron syndrome' with wasting ± fasciculation ± weakness in the distribution of a root(s), peripheral nerve(s), or plexus(i) ± depressed or absent re|exes ± sensory loss in the appropriate dermatomes. In small {ber neuropathies, for example, diabetes, HIV , and sometimes leprosy in the early stages, re|exes may remain present.
To reach a diagnosis of peripheral nerve syndromes, the following  questions  need  to  be  answered  after  the  history  and examination:

BOX 10.15 Patterns of Peripheral Nerve Syndromes
1.  Symmetric proximal and distal weakness and sensory loss (e.g., Guillain-Barré syndrome [GBS], chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy [CIDP], vasculitis).
2.  Symmetric distal weakness and sensory loss (e.g., diabetes, leprosy, toxic neuropathies [arsenic], nutritional deficiency [thiamine]).
3.  Asymmetric distal weakness with sensory loss: Multiple nerve involvement (mononeuritis multiplex), for example, vasculitis, leprosy, HIV, infiltration (lymphoma, carcinoma, sarcoidosis);
4. Single nerve involvement, for example, compression, but may be initial presentation of mononeuritis.
4.  Asymmetric distal or proximal weakness without sensory loss, for example, motor neuron disease (MND), polio, lead toxicity, post-infectious neuralgic amyotrophy, multifocal motor neuropathy with block (MMN).
5.  Asymmetric proximal and distal weakness with sensory loss, for example, GBS, CIDP, plexopathy due to diabetes or malignant infiltration, radiculopathies (e.g., tuberculosis, brucellosis).
6.  Symmetric sensory loss without weakness-mainly small fiber involvement (pain and temperature loss), for example, diabetes, HIV, nutritional deficiencies (thiamine, pyridoxine), toxins (ciguatera).
7.  Symmetric sensory loss without weakness-large fiber (joint position and vibration sensory loss) and small fiber, for example, diabetes, HIV, drugs, nutritional deficiencies, toxins (mercury, thallium).
8.  Marked proprioceptive sensory loss, for example, sensory ganglionopathies due to Sjögren's syndrome, paraneoplastic, B6 toxicity, HIV.

Myopathic Syndromes
There are fewer myopathic syndromes than neuropathic syndromes.
The important causes to consider in the tropics include HIV and drugs used to treat it, such as azidothymidine (AZT) (Box 10.16).
Symptoms  include  muscle  pain  (myalgia)  and  tenderness, dysphagia, and dark urine (myoglobinuria); weakness suggestive of  proximal  weakness  (dif{culty  rising  from  the  |oor  or  chair, climbing stairs, reaching above the head); exercise-induced muscle pains and cramps.
Examination includes weakness of neck |exion (sternomastoid muscles), muscles around the shoulder girdle (shoulder abductors [deltoid  muscle]),  and  pelvic  girdle  (hip  |exors  and  extensors in profoundly weak and wasted muscles, such as quadriceps (knee jerk, L3, L4).

============================================================
Myasthenic Syndromes
Symptoms include painless, |uctuating weakness that may affect ocular muscles, with drooping eyelids (ptosis) and double vision (diplopia), bulbar, and respiratory muscles (may be life threatening), as well as limb muscles.
In  myaesthenia  gravis  the  examination  includes  fatiguability  (increasing  weakness  with  exertion,  e.g.,  test  shoulder abduction before and after 20 repetitive abduction, adduction movements at the shoulders), which is pathognomonic, but in Lambert-Eaton  myasthenic  syndrome  (LEMS),  the  opposite occurs,  strength  increases  with  exercise.  In  botulism,  there  is progressive weakness, starting with pupillary involvement of the ocular muscles giving {xed pupils, followed by bulbar and limb muscle weakness. There is autonomic dysfunction as the toxin binds irreversibly with post-synaptic receptors at the cholinergic neuromuscular junction.
Drugs  such  as  penicillamine  can  rarely  cause  a  myasthenic -phosphates, used as pesticides and in chemical warfare, may also be ingested with suicidal intent. This causes an acute cholinergic crisis  as  a  result  of  acetylcholinesterase  inhibition  with  ocular, bulbar, limb, and respiratory weakness.

Approaches to Investigation, Diagnosis, and Management
The approach to investigation and diagnosis of peripheral nerve, muscle, and myasthenic disorders depends on whether only basic or more advanced facilities are available (Box 10.17).
The management of peripheral nerve syndromes depends on and neuropathic pain are shown in Box 10.18. The approach to managing myopathic syndromes is given in Box 10.19, and in Box 10.20 an overview of the approach to myaesthenia gravis is shown.
