INTRODUCTION
Giardiasis is a small intestinal infection resulting from infection with the flagellated protozoan parasite Giardia lamblia (syn. G. intestinalis , G. duodenalis ), likely first reported by Van Leeuwenhoek in 1681 [1].

============================================================
CHUNK 2
============================================================
EPIDEMIOLOGY
Giardia lamblia is constituted by seven different molecular types (genotypes A through G), each with some degree of host specificity. It is likely some of these genotypes will eventually be considered distinct species. Genotypes A and B are found in humans, and occasionally in a variety of other mammals. Conversely, genotypes C through G are found in a variety of other mammals [2]. They have a moderate degree of host specificity and have never been identified from human infections.  Therefore,  it  is  likely  that  most  human  infections  result (directly or indirectly) from human-to-human transmission. However, there are clearly exceptions. Beavers have been implicated as a source of  water-borne  human  outbreaks  in  a  couple  of  reports.  However, some controversy remains regarding the potential of household pets, especially  dogs,  as  sources  for  human  infection.  Most  studies  have shown the predominant or exclusive presence of genotypes C and D in dogs. However, some studies have identified genotypes A and B in dogs, fueling the controversy of whether dogs are a potential source of human giardiasis.
The most commonly identified risk factors relate to water-borne transmission, including backpacking, recreational water use, or having a shallow well for  drinking  water. Occasional  large outbreaks  due to contaminated water have been identified, including a recent outbreak of over 3000 symptomatic cases in a Norwegian city. The seasonality of infections in the US with increased occurrence in the summer and early  fall  probably  reflect  the  increased  use  of  recreational  water facilities.
The  increased  incidence  in  children  who  attend  daycare  facilities reflects direct fecal-oral transmission, while the increased incidence in homosexual men most likely results from oral-anal sexual contact. HIV  infection  has  not  been  reported  as  a  significant  risk  factor. Although less common than water-borne transmission, food-borne transmission has also been documented. Hypogammaglobulinemia has been associated with an increased risk of giardiasis [3]. Isolated IgA deficiency  may also  be  a risk  factor,  but  remains controversial. Impaired gastric acid secretion also increases the risk for acquisition of giardiasis.

============================================================
EPIDEMIOLOGY
Within the US, northern states have a higher incidence of giardiasis than the southern states, with case rates peaking at 30 per 100,000 population in Vermont (US average = 7)  [4],  perhaps due to  more prolonged cyst survival in cool moist climates. The above rates markedly underestimate the incidence, but stool prevalence rates of 2-5% are primarily from symptomatic patients and are overestimates.
Although there is little evidence for acquired resistance to infection, there appears to be partial resistance to symptomatic infection. Evidence includes a water-borne outbreak of giardiasis in a ski resort in the Rocky Mountains of the US, where local residents had a lower risk of symptoms. Similarly, very high rates of symptomatic disease (50100%)  have  been  reported  in  Finnish  travelers  to  St.  Petersburg, Russia, in the 1960s. In contrast, children in highly endemic regions such as Peru or Palestine are frequently asymptomatic; for example, in a shanty town near Lima, Peru, where the quality of available drinking  water  is  poor,  children  are  universally  infected  by the  age  of  2 years and are rapidly re-infected after treatment [5]. In these otherwise asymptomatic children, there is some evidence for  growth retardation.  However,  because  of  malnutrition  and  other  infection,  it  has been  difficult  to  determine  whether  there  is  a  causal  relationship between giardiasis  and growth  retardation in  these  children.  These observations suggest at least two very different patterns of transmission and disease. Populations with high rates of water contamination and continuing endemic transmission typically have high prevalence rates,  but  few  attributable  symptoms.  Conversely,  in  populations with generally safe water, transmission is irregular and prevalence is low. However, when  infections  do occur, they are frequently symptomatic.

NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
The life cycle of G. lamblia consists of two forms, the trophozoite and the cyst. The cyst is oval in shape and approximately 8 by 12 μ m in size and contains four nuclei that can be visualized microscopically. The cyst is environmentally resistant, and as few as 10 cysts can initiate infection after ingestion. After passage through the stomach, the cyst excysts to produce two binucleate trophozoites that are pear-shaped and  approximately  10-12 μ m in  length  by  5-7 μ m in  width.  The trophozoites move by the beating of four pairs of flagellae and attach to the wall of the small intestine by their concave ventral sucking disk (see Fig. 90.1). When the trophozoites detach from the intestinal wall, an  imprint  displays  the  site  of  their  attachment.  The  trophozoites
FIGURE 90.1 A scanning electron micrograph of Giardia lamblia trophozoites demonstrates the convex dorsal surface. Several of the eight Iagella can be seen.
replicate by binary fission and some of these trophozoites encyst after exposure to bile or as a result of cholesterol starvation, and are passed in the feces to continue the cycle of infection [6].
The course of naturally acquired giardiasis is highly variable, ranging from transient colonization to prolonged infection and from asymptomatic to severe diarrhea and weight loss. As noted above, partial immunity may account for some of those differences.  In addition, there is some evidence for differences in pathogenicity among different  isolates.  In  human  volunteer  studies,  all  10  volunteers  became infected with the GS isolate (genotype B) and five developed symptoms. On the other hand, none of five volunteers were infected with ISR (genotype A1). Genotype A2 differs about 1-2% from genotype A1 in DNA sequence, while genotype B differs by nearly 20% from both, suggesting that it may properly be considered a different species. Interestingly, some studies correlating symptoms with genotype have found that genotype B infections are more frequently symptomatic, while  others  have  found  that  symptoms  are  more  associated  with genotype  A2.  Genotype  A1  has  seldom  been  identified  in  these studies.

NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
Patients with symptomatic disease have villous shortening which can range from mild to severe, both from one patient to another and even within  the  same  patient.  Chronic  inflammatory  changes  are  frequently found.
There is no evidence for toxin-mediated diarrhea and mucosal invasion has not been convincingly shown. Therefore, much of the recent interest  has  focused  on  an  immunopathogenic  mechanism  for  the diarrhea. Animal models [7] and human observations [8] have shown epithelial  cell  dysfunction  and  impairment  of  the  barrier  function, likely involving intraepithelial lymphocytes.
The surfaces of trophozoites are coated with a cysteine-rich variantspecific  surface  protein  (VSP)  that  evokes  a  significant  immune response [9]. However, the organism can switch expression from one to another member of this large gene family, and this antigenic variation may contribute to the chronicity of the infection.

CLINICAL FEATURES
For  patients  who  develop  symptomatic  disease,  there  is  typically  a 1- to 2-week incubation period after exposure, followed by diarrhea that may be self-limited but frequently lasts 6 weeks or longer in the absence of treatment. Table 90-1 shows the approximate frequency of symptoms reported from a number of studies of symptomatic giardiasis [10-15]. Patients typically have diarrhea or loose stools marked by  loose  greasy  stools  with  a  foul  odor.  The  daily  stool  volume  is typically normal and one to several stools daily is usual. The diarrhea

is  frequently accompanied by abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, and  malabsorption  with  weight  loss  (Table  90-1).  Fatigue  is  commonly found. Fever is uncommon, and when present, it is found early and resolves with a few days. Bloody diarrhea and systemic toxicity are not seen with giardiasis and should raise the suspicion for invasive bacterial infections or amebiasis.
The physical examination is typically normal or demonstrates nonspecific abnormalities. Mild abdominal tenderness may be present, but severe tenderness should suggest an alternative diagnosis. Likewise, significant fluid loss is uncommon with giardiasis, so evidence of  dehydration  on  examination  or  by  laboratory  testing  should prompt a search for alternative diagnoses.

============================================================
CHUNK 7
============================================================
PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Giardiasis should be suspected in patients who present with subacute or chronic diarrhea, especially when the diarrhea is accompanied by weight  loss.  The  onset  of  giardiasis  can  be  relatively  indolent,  and frequently patients do not present for evaluation early, therefore giardiasis should be considered seriously in patients with at least 5 to 7 days of diarrhea. In contrast, most diarrhea caused by viral and bacterial  pathogens  resolves  within  3  to  5  days  [16].  In  addition,  the incubation period for giardiasis is typically 1 to 2 weeks, which distinguishes it from many other infectious etiologies. The differential diagnosis  includes  those  illnesses  that  present  with  subacute  or chronic diarrhea of a small intestinal source. The fluid and electrolyte loss caused by some small intestinal pathogens is distinctly uncommon with giardiasis. Thus, the list of pathogens that could produce diarrhea  mimicking  giardiasis  is  short,  but  could  include  atypical presentations  of Campylobacter or Salmonella infections.  Both  celiac disease and tropical sprue present with chronic diarrhea that may be accompanied by weight loss. Giardiasis typically has a more readily defined  onset  of  symptoms  than  celiac  disease  or  tropical  sprue. Celiac disease may be a more common cause of diarrhea in the US, but is much less common in many developing regions, so a travel and exposure  history  is  important.  Whipple's  disease  is  rare,  but  can present with chronic diarrhea and weight loss. Extraintestinal manifestations are common with Whipple's, but are not seen with giardiasis, with the exception of the occasional urticarial rash that has been reported. Lactose intolerance is a common cause of chronic diarrhea,

but  does  not  cause  weight  loss  and  resolves  with  elimination  of lactose from the diet. Irritable bowel syndrome frequently presents with chronic diarrhea, but does not cause weight loss. As noted below, it  is  particularly  common  after  an  episode  of  giardiasis.  Chronic diarrhea  is  commonly  found  in  advanced  HIV  infection  with  or without an identifiable pathogen. Conversely, HIV-infected patients are at increased risk for a variety of enteric pathogens, but there is not a  notable  increase  in  frequency  or  severity  of  giardiasis  in  these patients. Campylobacter or Salmonella spp. can occasionally cause prolonged diarrhea, so these pathogens should be considered.
The initial  diagnostic  test when giardiasis is  considered  is a microscopic  examination  of  a  concentrated  fecal  specimen  for  cysts  or trophozoites. Cysts are much more commonly found than trophozoites,  and  can  be  identified  equally  well  from  fresh  or  preserved specimens. In contrast, freshly collected specimens are required for the identification of trophozoites. When trophozoites are found, they correlate  highly  with  symptomatic  infection.  Three  separate  specimens should be evaluated for optimal sensitivity. Alternatively, there are several commercial Giardia cyst antigen tests available, all of which detect cyst antigens in fecal samples, either  by immunoassay or by immunofluorescence  or  chromatographic  detection  (Table  90-2). These are more sensitive than conventional microscopy, such that a single test can suffice. The sensitivity of the immunoassay tests is in the 93-100% range and the fluorescent antibody test near 100%, but with the caveat that there is not an adequate gold standard for a validation  of  the  diagnosis,  so  these  numbers  should  be  taken  with caution. The specificity of the tests is in the 98-99% range, so there should be few false-positive results in populations with a high prevalence. One limitation of these antigen-based tests is that they detect cysts, but not trophozoites. However, the enzyme imunoassay is less labor-intensive and does not require the availability of a fluorescent microscope. The use of PCR testing has been reported, but is not yet commercially available.

PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
For some patients with giardiasis, fecal examinations are repeatedly negative but Giardia trophozoites can be detected in the duodenum by endoscopy or by the string test. The string test involves the patient swallowing a capsule on the end of a string, pulling it out after 4 hours to  overnight,  and  then  examining  the  end  microscopically  for  the presence of trophozoites. An alternative approach is to perform an upper endoscopy with a biopsy and sampling of duodenal contents (see Fig. 90.2 for a histologic specimen of the small intestine showing a  flattened  villous  and  a  mononuclear  inflammatory  response), which adds the potential of identifying other entities such as tropical or celiac sprue.
There  are  no  serologic  tests  that  are  useful  for  the  diagnosis  of giardiasis.
In clinical practice, it is very common to empirically treat for giardiasis in patients who have a clinical presentation consistent with giardiasis, especially in resource-poor areas.

============================================================
TREATMENT
Drugs from several different classes have excellent efficacy for treatment of giardiasis (Table 90-3) [17,18]. The nitroimidazoles are the most commonly used drugs in the US, and perhaps worldwide, primarily metronidazole and tinidazole. These two drugs are essentially 100% absorbed by the oral route. Initial concerns regarding metronidazole in pregnancy have been allayed, at least for the second and third trimesters, by extensive experience with treating bacterial vaginosis.  Nausea  and  a  metallic  taste  are  common  and  potentially treatment-limiting side effects. These drugs also have a disulfiram-like activity  after  ethanol  ingestion,  so  alcohol  use  during  treatment  is prohibited. Single-dose and short courses of therapy with metronidazole have had high failure rates, so treatment should be continued for 5 to 10 days, while tinidazole demonstrates excellent efficacy with single-dose therapy, which may make it the preferred agent in many settings.  Secnidazole  and ornidazole are other nitroimidazoles that have excellent efficacy with single-dose treatment courses, but are not available in the US.
Albendazole is an antihelminthic agent that inhibits tubulin and has activity against giardiasis. In addition, its broad antihelminthic activity may be an advantage in settings with a high prevalence of intestinal helminth infections. However, single-dose therapy has demonstrated poor efficacy for the treatment of giardiasis, so treatment courses of 5 days are used. Some studies have shown reduced efficacy in comparison with nitroimidazoles. Albendazole has been associated with embryopathy, so it should be avoided at least during the first trimester of pregnancy.
Quinacrine  has  excellent  efficacy  and  at  one  time  was  the  drug  of choice in the US, but has been largely replaced by the nitroimidazoles, partly  because  of  nausea  and  vomiting  and  occasional  reports  of psychosis.
Nitazoxanide has activity for Giardia and Cryptosporidium as  well  as other microbes and has been approved for use in the US. Nitazoxanide  has  been  studied  in  children  using  3-day  courses,  yielding response rates of about 70-80%, and has been well tolerated.

============================================================
CHUNK 11
============================================================
TREATMENT
Furazolidone  became  popular  for  treating  giardiasis  in  children because it is tolerated better than quinacrine and is available in liquid suspension. In clinical studies, it has yielded cure rates of 80-94%. However, compliance is more difficult than with some drugs, since it is administered four times daily for 7 to 10 days.
Paromomycin has been evaluated in a few earlier studies, demonstrating an efficacy of about 55-90% [17]. It is commonly recommended for treatment of giardiasis during pregnancy, at least during the first trimester, because of its perceived safety in that setting.
Persistent  symptoms after  treatment  of  giardiasis  are  common and usually do not represent continued infection. After a large outbreak of giardiasis in Norway, as many as 40% of patients had prolonged

TREATMENT
fatigue and abdominal symptoms without evidence of ongoing infection  [19]  or  benefit  from Giardia -specific  treatment.  Persistent  gastrointestinal symptoms are common after treatment of several other intestinal pathogens as well [20]. Therefore, if someone has persistent or recurrent symptoms after treatment for giardiasis, the presence or absence of giardiasis  should  be  confirmed  by  fecal examination.  A negative test in someone with persistent diarrhea but no weight loss suggests post-infectious irritable bowel or perhaps lactose intolerance. However, with a negative fecal examination in the setting of weight loss, upper endoscopy should be considered, to identify other diagnoses such as gluten enteropathy.
For patients with documented relapse after treatment, re-treatment is usually  effective.  Drug  resistance  has  been  proposed  as  a  possible reason for treatment failure; however, because of culture difficulties, few susceptibility studies have been performed. In addition, relapses may be more common in the setting of immunoglobulin deficiency, so immunoglobulin levels should be determined. Patients who fail re-treatment  with  a  standard  course  of  a  nitroimidazole  usually respond to subsequent treatment with metronidazole in addition to either albendazole or quinacrine.

PREVENTION
The  majority  of  cases  of  giardiasis  occur  through  the  ingestion  of contaminated  water,  so  backpackers  and  travelers  to  regions  with inadequately purified water should purify the water by filtration with a 1-2μ m (or smaller) pore size or by heating the water to 70°C for 10  minutes  or  boiling.  Halogenation  will  also  inactivate  cysts  but must be prolonged. Contaminated hands are the source of Giardia in the  setting  of  daycare  or  food,  therefore  hand  washing  should  be employed.
