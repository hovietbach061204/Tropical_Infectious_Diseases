southern  Sudan  and  the  Ethiopian  Highlands  in  the  East.  In  the Americas,  isolated  foci  remain  in  Mexico,  Guatemala,  Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Brazil [3] (Fig. 1 12.1B). The infection is also found in Yemen [4]. Blinding disease in highly endemic communities in the savanna of West Africa heretofore has affected up to 30% of the population. Onchocerciasis foci have been  classified  epidemiologically into hyperendemic, mesoendemic, and hypoendemic, according to disease prevalence: > 60%, 30-60%, and < 30%, respectively. In highly endemic areas, O. volvulus infection is acquired early in life and over 90% of inhabitants may be infected by the age of 20 years.  In  communities  with  a  low  prevalence  of  infection,  there  is often little evidence of clinical disease. Onchocerciasis accounts for approximately  1  in  500  medical  conditions  diagnosed  in  returned travelers, and the risk of infection will be higher among travelers to rural areas of Africa where the parasite is endemic [5].
- Infection with O. volvulus can also cause debilitating skin disease, including localized onchodermatitis ('sowda') and chronic papular onchodermatitis
- Ivermectin is the treatment of choice
- Control of onchocerciasis consists of semi-annual or annual treatment of populations

INTRODUCTION
Onchocerciasis was first described in 1875 by John O'Neill, a British naval surgeon, among inhabitants of the West African coast suffering from  a  pruritic  skin  disease  known  as  'craw-craw' .  Onchocerciasis remains today a leading cause of debilitating skin and ocular disease in endemic regions in Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of Latin America. Forty percent of disability-adjusted  life years attributed  to the  disease  are  due  to  visual  impairment,  and  60%  to  the  severe itching with skin disease. Infection has been associated with increased mortality independent of its effects on sight, and poses a major hurdle to economic wellbeing in highly endemic areas of Africa. However, control  programs  using  repeated  community  treatments  with  ivermectin  can  prevent  public  health  consequences  of the  disease  and eliminate the infection in endemic regions in the Americas and possibly in Africa.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Onchocerciasis  is  found  in  36  countries,  where  an  estimated  37 million  people  are  infected,  and  some  500,000  suffer  significant visual loss of which about one-half are blind [1, 2]. An estimated 85.6 million people are thought to be at risk of infection worldwide [1]. Onchocerciasis is most prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa (Fig. 1 12.1A) and is a major public health problem along rivers where the black fly vectors breed, from Senegal, Guinea, and Sierra Leone in the West to

NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS AND PATHOLOGY
Infectious O.  volvulus L3  larvae  are  transmitted  by  black  flies  (Fig. 112.2) and develop into adults that are found in subcutaneous fibrous nodules or onchocercomata (Fig. 1 12.3). Male adults migrate between nodules where they fertilize sedentary females. Females release thousands of larvae  or microfilariae  into  the surrounding tissues where they can be ingested by feeding black flies to complete the life cycle (see Fig. 1 12.4). The period from an infective bite to the detection of microfilariae in skin is generally between 10 and 20 months. Individuals  infected  with O.  volvulus can  suffer  disease  affecting  the  skin, lymph nodes, and eyes. Pathology in these tissues is caused by inflammatory  reactions  that  follow  the  death  of  microfilariae.  It  can  be caused by the secretion of toxic products by granulocytes, the deposition of immune complexes in the tissues, or by inflammatory mechanisms  induced by release of Wolbachia (bacteria infecting the filariae)-derived  products.  Most  clinical  manifestations  associated with O. volvulus infection are related to the chronic effects of repeated episodes  of  inflammation.  Clinical  disease  can  also  follow  short periods of exposure such as among visitors to or expatriates living in endemic areas.

NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS AND PATHOLOGY
Skin  disease  is  caused  by  skin-dwelling  microfilariae  that  secrete enzymes such as  collagenase  during  their  migration,  causing  longterm damage to dermal collagen and elastin. Loss of skin elasticity and early  aging  characterize  chronic  disease.  Microfilariae  are  seen histologically  at  the  dermo-epidermal  junction  (Fig.  1 12.5A)  and 'live' intact microfilariae are generally observed free of inflammatory cells. The inflammatory changes take place in the upper dermis and include  edema  and  fibrosis.  Acute  papules  show  intraepidermal microabscess formation with dead or degenerating microfilariae surrounded by eosinophils and neutrophils (Fig. 112.5B). There can be loss of melanin from basal cells, loss of elastic fibres in the dermis, and  atrophy  of  the  dermis.  The  dermatitis  correlates  with  where microfilariae  predominate,  particularly  around  the  buttocks  and pelvic girdle where the inguinal and femoral nodes show evidence of  lymphadenitis  and  fibrosis.  Lichenified  onchodermatitis  (LOD) (also known as localized onchocerciasis or 'sowda') (Fig. 1 12.6C) is

characterized by enlarged, soft, regional lymph nodes associated with localized skin changes that histologically show a hyperreactive inflammatory cell infiltrate with sclerosis and edema but few microfilariae. Scarring in lymph nodes may lead to regional lymphedema, hanging groin (Fig. 1 12.6F), or elephantiasis.

NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS AND PATHOLOGY
Individuals  with  higher  microfilarial  burdens  are  more  likely  to develop severe ocular disease. Ocular lesions are caused by the invasion and local death of microfilariae. Microfilariae can enter the eye through the bulbar conjunctiva, along the sheaths of the scleral vessels and nerves, or by embolization in the choroidal or ciliary capillaries. Punctate keratitis (Fig. 1 12.7A) is observed clinically in the corneal stroma and clears without scarring. Punctate opacities are focal accumulations  of  lymphocytes  and  eosinophils  around  degenerating microfilariae  with  local  edema.  Sclerosing  keratitis  (Fig.  1 12.7B) is  a  progressive  fibrovascular  pannus  and  inflammatory  infiltrate composed mainly of lymphocytes and eosinophils which starts at the level of Bowman's membrane. Mild, chronic uveitis is common with heavy microfilarial invasion of the anterior chamber. Lesions of the posterior chamber include optic atrophy and chorioretinopathy. The extent  of  chorioretinal  changes  is  highly  variable  and  the  retinal pigment epithelium can show migration, clumping, atrophy, or focal hyperplasia. Chronic nongranulomatous chorioretinitis consists of an infiltrate of lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils with secondary degenerative changes in the overlying retinal pigment epithelium and neuroretina. Loss of the photoreceptors and outer layers of the retina  can  be  due  to  inflammatory  damage  to  the  retinal  pigment epithelium and choriocapillaris. This is followed by consecutive loss of the inner neuroretina, ganglion cells, and nerve fibres. Profound chorioretinal atrophy can develop with loss of almost all the retina and choroid. Optic atrophy is common in the more advanced stages of ocular onchocerciasis (Fig. 1 12.7E,F).

The earliest and most troublesome symptom of onchocercal skin

============================================================
SKIN DISEASE
The  earliest  and  most  troublesome  symptom  of  onchocercal  skin involvement is itching [6]. The skin changes have been classified as acute papular onchodermatitis (APOD), chronic papular onchodermatitis  (CPOD),  lichenified  onchodermatitis  (LOD),  atrophy,  and depigmentation [6]. More than one skin disease type can coexist in an individual. APOD consists of small pruritic papules (Fig. 1 12.6A). Because of pruritus,  there can  be excoriations,  secondary infection, and ulceration. APOD is the typical presentation in individuals with short exposure histories, and in such individuals, microfilariae may not be detectable.

============================================================
CHUNK 9
============================================================
SKIN DISEASE
CPOD consists  of  flat-topped  papules  that  vary  in  size  and  height above the skin surface (Fig. 1 12.6B). Some lesions can  be macular. Itching can occur, and individuals with CPOD may also have acute lesions. LOD or 'sowda' typically affects young adults and is characterized by pruritic, hyperpigmented and hyperkeratotic plaques (Fig. 112.6C). The distribution is asymmetric, involving one limb, and is associated with regional lymphadenopathy. In later stages, the skin can be grossly lichenified. Itching is intense in the acute stage; this condition can coexist with APOD or CPOD. Atrophy of the skin is relatively common in areas of high endemicity (Fig. 1 12.6D). Atrophic skin adopts many of the characteristics of aging, such as loss of elasticity, and the skin appears excessively wrinkled. Hairs may be lost and sweating reduced. Onchocercal depigmentation or 'leopard skin' is associated with patches of complete pigment loss and generally affects the lower leg anteriorly (Fig. 1 12.6E). A rare manifestation is 'hanging groin'  or  'adenolymphocele'  that  is  observed  only  in  heavy  and longstanding infections, and consists of a pouch of lymphedematous tissue in which hang atrophic inguinal or femoral nodes (Fig. 1 12.6F). Inflammatory damage to the lymph nodes and lymphatics may, over the long term, lead to elephantiasis of the limbs or genitalia.

NODULES
Onchocercomata are subcutaneous fibrous nodules containing adult worms,  found  in  the  region  of  the  iliac  crest,  the  trochanter,  the sacrum, the upper thorax and head (Fig. 1 12.8). Nodules are often absent among patients with short exposure histories but may become detectable later in the course of the infection.

LYMPH NODES
Lymph node changes are commonly seen where they drain areas of onchodermatitis. Usually the nodes are only slightly enlarged, firm, and  nontender.  Acute  regional  lymphadenopathy  can  accompany acute papular eruptions and lymphedema, but lymph node pathology is usually clinically silent.

CHUNK 12
============================================================
EYE DISEASE
Punctate keratitis (fluffy or snowflake opacities) consists of opacities of the superficial corneal stroma (Fig. 1 12.7A). They can be seen by the  naked  eye  or  visualized  using  a  slit  lamp.  Up  to  100  or  more opacities measuring 0.5 mm in diameter may be observed, and these lesions heal without scarring. Punctate keratitis can be asymptomatic or  accompanied  by  conjunctival  injection,  chemosis,  limbitis  and epiphora. Longstanding and heavy infections can result in massive invasion  of  the  cornea,  leading  to  the  development  of  sclerosing keratitis,  a  slowly  progressive  scarring  of  the  cornea  (Fig.  1 12.7B). Severe anterior uveitis (iridocyclitis) can occur with the development of posterior synechiae and pear-shaped deformity of the pupil, a loss of the iris pigment frill and a pumice-stone appearance of the iris [7]. Extensive synechiae can cause seclusio- and occlusio-pupillae, secondary cataracts, and secondary glaucoma [7].

EYE DISEASE
Chorioretinitis or chorioretinopathy is slowly progressive, taking many years before visual loss is evident. It is characterized by retinal pigment epithelial atrophy and chorioretinal scarring [7]. Chorioretinopathy in onchocerciasis is first seen as a loss of pigment lateral to the macula (Fig. 1 12.7C,D) or nasal to the optic disc at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Pigment loss appears as a grey-yellow mottling. RPE  loss progresses in  an  arc  around  the  macula  and eventually  may  become  confluent,  producing  areas  of  geographic atrophy  (Fig.  1 12.7F).  Extensive  atrophy  can  be  accompanied  by choriocapillary atrophy (the choroidal vessels become exposed) and subretinal fibrosis. The macula is often preserved until late in the course of disease. Mild forms of RPE atrophy may be detected only by fluorescein angiography. Fundal changes are usually symmetric. Post-neuritic optic atrophy reflects previous episodes of active inflammation of the optic nerve [7] (Fig. 1 12.7E). Onchocercal optic atrophy can also follow extensive destruction of the retina (Fig. 1 12.7F). Both forms are generally  accompanied  by  inflammatory  changes  such  as  peripapillary hyperpigmentation and sheathing of the central retinal vessels.

OTHER COMPLICATIONS
Chronic infections are associated with low body weight and diffuse musculoskeletal pain. A form of dwarfism, Nakalanga dwarfism, has been attributed to pituitary involvement in this disease in the Mabira forest  of  Uganda  [8].  An  association  with  epilepsy  has  also  been reported [8, 9]. Other conditions are reproductive abnormalities with secondary amenorrhea, spontaneous abortion, and infertility.

============================================================
CHUNK 17
============================================================
PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The chance of acquiring O. volvulus infection  increases with  greater exposure time in endemic regions (Box 1 12.1). Some patients may be diagnosed through investigation of eosinophilia. A presumptive diagnosis can be made based on a history of exposure in an endemic area,  the  presence of subcutaneous  nodules,  or typical  skin  and/or ocular signs. Early onchodermatitis is rarely diagnosed correctly and must be distinguished from atopic dermatitis, food allergies, contact dermatitis, insect bites and scabies. Chronic skin lesions can be mistaken  for  severe  chronic  eczema,  malnutrition  and  presbydermia. 'Leopard skin' must be distinguished from other causes of hypochromia, including vitiligo and leprosy.
Definitive diagnosis depends on the identification of microfilariae in skin snips or of the adult worms from excised or aspirated nodules [10]. Ocular microfilariae can be detected by slit lamp examination. The chances of detection are increased if patients are asked to sit with their head between their legs for up to 10 minutes prior to examination. Microfilariae in the anterior chamber are seen as small wriggling worms. Live microfilariae in the cornea are transparent and coiled up. Skin snips can be obtained using a corneoscleral punch (Fig. 1 12.9A) or by elevating a crease of skin with the point of a needle (Fig. 1 12.9B) and  obtaining  a  small  circular  disc-shaped  slice  of  epidermis  and superficial dermis using a scalpel blade. The skin snip is then incubated  on  a  glass  slide  in  saline  and  examined  using  a  dissecting microscope  (or  magnifying  glass)  to  detect  emergent  microfilariae [10].
Assays to detect specific antibodies to Onchocerca [1 1-14]  and PCR [15]  to  detect  onchocercal  DNA  in  skin  snips  are  now  in  use  in

specialized laboratories and are highly sensitive and specific. Although current serologic assays have limited ability to discriminate past exposures  from  current  infections,  the  detection  of O.  volvulus DNA  in microscopically negative skin snips is useful in individuals with light infections.
Individuals with no evidence of O. volvulus microfilariae in the skin or eyes can be challenged using the Mazzotti test. The patient is given a single oral dose of 25-50 mg of diethylcarbamazine (DEC). Patients should have a complete ocular examination before considering the performance of this test because DEC may cause irreversible damage to  the  posterior  segment  of  the  eye.  Infected  individuals  develop intense  pruritus  between  30  minutes  and  24  hours  after  the  test, which can be accompanied by erythema, edema and papular dermatitis  (Fig.  1 12.5C).  The  presence  of M.  streptocerca may  cause  falsepositive reactions.

============================================================
TREATMENT
Ivermectin is the most important drug for the treatment of onchocerciasis.  It  is  well  tolerated,  highly  efficacious,  and  rapidly  reduces microfilarial numbers in the skin [16]. The drug is administered as a single dose of 150 μ g/kg.  Because ivermectin has limited effects on adult worms, treatment must be repeated at annual or semi-annual intervals  for  the  duration  of  the  lives  of  adult  worms  to  suppress dermal microfilarial levels [17]. Ivermectin significantly reduces the itching  of  reactive  onchocercal  skin  disease  (APOD,  CPOD  and LOD),  but  because  microfilariae  can  re-invade  the  skin  within  6 months  of  treatment,  annual  treatments  may  not  be  sufficient  to control pruritus, and treatments every 3 months may be necessary for the  first  1-2  years.  Contraindications  for  ivermectin  treatment  are conditions associated with an impaired blood-brain barrier because penetration  into  the  CNS  can  cause  lethargy,  ataxia,  tremors  and death. The drug is not approved for use in children weighing less than 15 kg  (Box  1 12.2),  pregnant  women,  and  mothers  nursing  infants during  the  first  week  of  life.  Ivermectin  has  no  significant  drug interactions.
Ivermectin has a marked beneficial effect on anterior segment disease [7,  18].  A  single  dose  of  ivermectin  is  associated  with  a  reduction in  the  prevalence  of  punctate  corneal  opacities  and  microfilariae

============================================================
CHUNK 20
============================================================
BOX 112.2  Pediatric Considerations - Treatment
- Ivermectin is not approved for use in children weighing less than 15 kg
- Doxycycline is contraindicated in children aged below 9 years and in pregnant women
in  the  anterior  chamber  (MfAC).  Repeated  treatments  result  in  an improvement in the early lesions of iridocyclitis and sclerosing keratitis.  There is evidence that ivermectin may also have a useful effect even in relatively advanced cases of iridocyclitis. The benefits of ivermectin  on  posterior  segment  disease  are  less  clear,  with  the  drug shown to be beneficial against the development of optic atrophy but not chorioretinal diseases [7, 18]. Control programs using ivermectin are  expected  to  have  a  major  impact  on  the  development  of  the lesions  of  ocular  onchocerciasis,  and  should  prevent  much  of  the visual loss and blindness associated with this infection [7, 18].
There are  few side effects and it is generally well tolerated. A  mild clinical reaction (Mazzotti-like reaction) occurs in 10-20% of patients receiving  a  first  dose  of  ivermectin;  a  more  severe  reaction  may  be seen. Most reactions occur on the second day after treatment, although severe reactions can commence within 12 hours. During subsequent treatments, the frequency and severity of adverse reactions is reduced. Reactions are characterized by worsening of rash in previously affected areas. Edema can affect one limb or the face and is associated with enlarged tender regional lymph nodes. A systemic reaction may be observed, characterized by fever, arthralgia, musculoskeletal pain, and severe postural hypotension. Patients with LOD tend to have more severe  reactions  following  treatment.  Mild  reactions  require  only symptomatic treatment (e.g. antihistamines and antipyretics). Severe reactions may require intramuscular or intravenous steroids. Extreme caution should be exercised in those with a possible exposure history to  loiasis  -  the  death  of Loa  loa microfilariae  can  cause  severe,  or even fatal, encephalitis [19]. It is recommended that the presence of heavy infections with Loa loa should be excluded using thin blood films [19].

BOX 112.2  Pediatric Considerations - Treatment
Because a Wolbachia endosymbiotic bacteria is present in O. volvulus and is required for the survival of Onchocerca, doxycycline at a daily dose  of  200 mg  for  6  weeks  inhibits O.  volvulus fertility  and  kills approximately 50% of adult worms when given with a single standard dose of ivermectin [20-22]. Such treatment regimens have even been used in small community-based treatment programs. This approach (doxycycline  plus  ivermectin)  provides  a  macrofilaricidal  treatment option for individuals who do not live in endemic areas and are thus unlikely to get re-infected.

CHUNK 22
============================================================
CONTROL
The initial objective of onchocerciasis control strategies was to reduce community microfilarial burdens to levels that were associated with negligible morbidity. Elimination of onchocerciasis is now considered a realistic objective not only in small foci in parts of Latin America (e.g.  Ecuador)  [3,  23,  24]  but  also  in  many  regions  of  Africa  [25]. Currently, the focus of control strategies is through semi-annual (in Latin America) [3] or annual distribution (in Africa) [26] of ivermectin that has been provided gratis by the manufacturer (Merck & Co) for  as  long  as  it  is  needed.  The  highly  successful  Onchocerciasis Control Programme (OCP) in West Africa that relied on vector control measures was phased out in 2002 [26], and control presently relies on ivermectin as the primary control measure [26]. Concerns for both suboptimal microfilaricidal responses to ivermectin or possible resistance [27] have surfaced such that measures that would be adjunctive to annual ivermectin distribution are being sought.
