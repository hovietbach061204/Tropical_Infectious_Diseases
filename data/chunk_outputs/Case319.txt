INTRODUCTION
Paracoccidioidomycosis is a systemic mycosis endemic in South and Central America caused by dimorphic fungi of two species Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and P. lutzii. 1,2
This mycosis was discovered by Adolfo Lutz in Brazil in 1908. Alfonso Splendore (1912) published several cases in São Paulo, Brazil, and described the etiologic agent. Floriano P . de Almeida (1930) distinguished this mycosis from coccidioidomycosis. 1,3,4 In 2006 a new species of Paracoccidioides was recognized and named P. lutzii. Three clades of P. brasiliensis have been detected, S1, PS2, and PS3, with different geographic distribution. 2,5,6

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Paracoccidioidomycosis is endemic in humid tropical and subtropical areas of Latin America, from Southern Mexico to 34° south in  Argentina  and  Uruguay  (Fig.  88.1).  It  is  common  in  Brazil, where 80% of all patients are detected and where it is one of the leading  causes  of  death; it  also  occurs  in Argentina,  Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, and Venezuela. 3,7,8 P. lutzii is only endemic in the west-central regions of Brazil (states of Goiás, Mato Grosso, 5,6 The incidence and prevalence of paracoccidioidomycosis  are  not  known  because  there  is  no  compulsory reporting except in some Brazilian states. 2
Endemic zones have acidic soils, rich in organic material, with many streams and rivers, and exuberant vegetation. Although the habitat of Paracoccidioides spp. is not well known, it probably lives in  soil  near  water.  It  has  been  isolated  from  different  natural sources, but these isolations are dif{cult to replicate. In addition to  humans,  infection  has  been  observed  in  armadillos,  squirrel monkeys, dogs, horses, cattle, and wild rodents. Animal-to-human and human-to-human transmission has not been con{rmed. 2-4,7
to progressive clinical forms is frequently observed in adult males older than 35 years of age, the majority of whom are rural workers. Genetics, smoking, and alcoholism seem to be risk factors.
The juvenile type of paracoccidioidomycosis is less common (only 3%-5% of clinical cases), affects both sexes equally, and has an acute or subacute course. 3,7,9

NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
In infected tissue and culture at 37°C, Paracoccidioides spp. appear as  spherical  cells  of  10  to  40 μ m in  diameter  with  a  thick  birefringent cell wall and several peripheral buds, like a pilot wheel. Mother cells  with  a  single  blastoconidium  and  short  chains  of three to four budding cells are often found (Fig. 88.2). In Sabouraud dextrose  agar  and  in  yeast  extract  agar  at  25°C, Paracoccidioides spp. grow very slowly and yield cotton-like, whitish colonies that exhibit branched, septated, and hyaline hyphae with chlamydospores and aleurioconidiae. Minor differences in the conidia's shape can be detected between the mycelial forms of the two Paracoccidioides species; the three P. brasiliensis clades are morphologically identical. 5
Infection  is  most  likely  acquired  by  airborne  inhalation  of aleurioconidiae that turn into yeast-like elements inside alveolar macrophages.  A  non-speci{c  in|ammatory  reaction  is  initially observed.  In  a  few  days,  the  in|ammatory  changes  progress  to epithelioid  cell  granuloma  with  giant  cells,  plasmacytes,  and lymphocytes. 10-13 Microabscesses are common, and caseous necrosis is  observed  in  lymph  nodes  and  adrenal  glands.  Tissue  repair involves  {brosis.  Cell-mediated  immunity,  with  a  predominant Th1  cytokine  response  (INFγ ,  IL 12 ,  IL2,  TNFα ),  is  the  most important  defense  mechanism,  and  is  genetically  controlled. Antibodies  are  produced  during  progressive  disease,  but  their signi{cance in the control of the infection is not well understood. 10,11 In  patients with  severe  disease  there  is  an increased  activity  of regulatory T cells with a strong immune suppression produced by IL10 and TGFβ . 12
Progressive  paracoccidioidomycosis  may  be  the  result  of reactivation of a latent  focus of infection (in chronic forms) or the lack of control of the primary infection (in the acute juvenile type). 3,4,9,10

Non-Progressive Infections
Primary  infections  are  often  asymptomatic  or  mild  and  selflimited;  symptomatic  primary  infections  are  rare. 9 Six  percent to {fty percent of inhabitants of endemic regions have positive paracoccidioidin  skin  tests  as  evidence  of  a  prior  subclinical infection. 3,9

============================================================
Acute Form of Juvenile Type
This  clinical  form  in  children  and  adolescents  has  an  acute course  marked  by  toxemia,  fever,  asthenia,  anorexia,  weight loss,  subcutaneous  abscesses,  diffuse  lymphadenopathy,  hepatosplenomegaly, diarrhea, jaundice, anemia, and leukocytosis with eosinophilia. It is probably due to failure of the immune response during the primary infection. 10,11 Acneiform lesions of the skin, scrofuloderma,  osteomyelitis,  and  gastrointestinal  involvement are  often  present.  Moderate  cases  with  a  stable  general  condition and localized lymph node involvement occur (Fig. 88.3). 1-4,7 Involvement of the lungs and mucous membrane lesions are rarely observed.

Chronic Form of Adult Type
This usually occurs in adult males. It has an insidious onset with prominent asthenia, weight loss, and exertional dyspnea. 3,9,14
In 25% of cases, there is only pulmonary involvement, with low-grade fever, cough, mucopurulent sputum, hemoptysis, and dyspnea. Chest x-rays show bilateral symmetric lesions, generally perihilar  in  distribution,  resembling  the  wings  of  the  butter|y, formed by in{ltrates, and micronodular and linear shadows (Fig. 88.4). Death occurs after several years, due to cachexia or respiratory impairments. 3,7,14

(mulberry-like stomatitis) (Fig. 88.5). A {rm, red-violet edema is frequently observed in the lips and gingival mucosa (thromboid-like lip). 3 These lesions make eating and drinking painful. Laryngeal attacks cause dysphonia, obstructive dyspnea, and dysphagia. 2-4
Skin lesions include papules, nodules, and ulcers; they are often located  on  the  face  and  neck  (Fig.  88.6).  Some  ulcers  become vegetative and papillomatous. Cervical lymph nodes are generally hypertrophic and {rm but can be suppurative or necrotic, opening to  the  skin  and  causing  a  scrofula-like  lesion.  Adrenal  gland involvement occurs in more than 15% of chronic cases and, when severe, causes Addison's disease. CNS compromise is observed in 10% of cases; abscessed granulomas located in the posterior fossa and subacute meningoencephalitis have been reported (Fig. 88.7). Other locations  are  testicles,  epididymis,  prostate,  bones,  liver, and spleen. Death may occur from respiratory failure, malnutrition, or intercurrent infections. 3,4,9
In some Brazilian states (Mato Grosso, Goias) a different clinical form  has  been  observed,  characterized  by  chronic  peritonitis, hepatosplenomegaly, mesenteric lymphadenopathy, and compromise of the digestive tract. This form is probably related to P. lutzii . 2,5 After effective treatment, some lesions remain latent, and relapses can occasionally occur. 3

PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Diagnosis is  con{rmed by {nding typical yeastlike elements of Paracoccidioides spp. in microscopy of wet preparations of specimens (see  Fig.  88.2).  Cultures  should  be  done  in  yeast  extract  agar without glucose, brain-heart infusion agar, and Sabouraud dextrose agar with antibiotics and cycloheximide, and incubated for 4 weeks at 25°C and 37°C. The fungus grows slowly, and its isolation is dif{cult. Inoculation of clinical specimens in laboratory animals is rarely done. 1,3,4,7,9
Histopathologic  specimens  should  be  stained  with  periodic acid-Schiff or Grocott methenamine-silver. 3,9,14
In progressive forms of paracoccidioidomycosis, antibodies can be detected by immunodiffusion in agar gel, counterimmunoelectrophoresis, complement {xation tests, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A speci{c glycoprotein of 43 kDa (gp 43), as well as other antigens, have been used in testing. 9,11,14 Antibodies  against Paracoccidioides antigens  can  be  detected  by Western blot, but this is infrequently used. 15 Antibody titers are proportional to severity of the infection, and with cure they decline or become negative. In endemic areas of P. lutzii serologic reactions should be done with species-speci{c antigens. 5,6,16 In severe cases, antigen  can  be  detected  in  serum  and  urine  by  ELISA  using monoclonal antibodies against gp 43. 4,17
The paracoccidioidin skin test has little diagnostic value for progressive paracoccidioidomycosis. It can be used in epidemiologic studies; most infected people without active lesions have positive reactions. 3,4,9,10,14
In patients with severe disease, serology is positive with high titers; paracoccidioidin skin test is often negative; and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia and eosinophilia and low CD4-positive T-cell counts are frequently detected. All these alterations may revert to normal with clinical improvement. 3,4,9,14

PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The differential diagnosis of chronic disseminated disease can be  confused  with  tuberculosis,  histoplasmosis,  leishmaniasis, carcinoma, and sarcoidosis. Acute disseminated disease presents with clinical characteristics similar to tuberculosis, malaria, leukemia, and lymphomas.

TREATMENT
Sulfonamides, ketoconazole, itraconazole, |uconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole,  and  amphotericin  B  have  been  successfully  used for treatment. 18-20 Accepted treatment schedules are ketoconazole day for 6 months; and intravenous amphotericin B at daily dose -conazole is the treatment of choice and is effective in more than 95%  of  cases;  however,  neither  itraconazole  nor  ketoconazole should be used in cases with CNS infection. The absorption of itraconazole requires gastric acid, and its effect can be reduced by fungal involvement of mesenteric lymph nodes and the digestive tract, especially in acute disseminated form. It should not be used for  patients  with  tuberculosis  being  treated  with  rifampin. 19 In severe cases where malabsorption is present, amphotericin B is indicated.  Fluconazole  by  oral  route  or  intravenously  has  been successfully  used  in  cases  with  brain  lesions,  at  a  daily  dose  of 800 mg. 2,3
Co-trimoxazole is still frequently used in Brazil, especially in recently diagnosed patients with no previous therapy, in chronic unifocal progressive disease, and as maintenance after a course of amphotericin B. It is given to adults every 12 hours, at a dosage of 160 mg of trimethoprim and 800 mg of sulfamethoxazole, for 2 to 3 years. 4,18 It is the treatment of choice in patients with CNS to 1600 mg every 12 hours. 19
Children suffering paracoccidioidomycosis are usually treated oral medication and can have frequent involvement of mesenteric lymph nodes. 3,4,19
Other drugs that have been successfully used are voriconazole, posaconazole, and terbina{ne, but clinical experience with them remains  limited.  Voriconazole  has  been  used  in  double-blind comparative study with itraconazole, with similar ef{cacy; voriconazole is more expensive. 2,20

are  common, and cure often leaves incapacitating sequelae,  for example, laryngeal and tracheal stenosis, buccal atresia, and pulmonary  {brosis.  According  to  studies  in  murine  models  of experimental paracoccidioidomycosis, the simultaneous administration of itraconazole and pentoxifylline reduced  pulmonary {brosis. 2,4,14
Although several antigens have been studied as immunogens to prevent paracoccidioidomycosis in laboratory animals, none of them have been used in human beings, and there is no measure to avoid the risk of infection. 2,4,10
