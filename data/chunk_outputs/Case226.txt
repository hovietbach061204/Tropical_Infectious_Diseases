Key features
- Pentastomiasis (synonyms: porocephalosis, linguatulosis, or linguatuliasis) is caused by maxillopod crustaceans known as pentastomids or pentastomes
- Linguatula infection is acquired by eating raw o'al. In humans, migrating larvae cause obstructive symptoms in various organs or acute nasopharyngeal pentastomiasis (Halzoun or Marrara syndrome)
- Armillifer infection is acquired by eating raw snake meat or drinking water contaminated by snakes. Unless infection is massive, it is asymptomatic but revealed by appearance of calci(ed larvae on abdominal radiographs
- There is no proven chemotherapy, but ivermectin, praziquantel, or mebendazole could be tried in severe symptomatic cases; surgery may be needed to relieve obstructive symptoms
- Prevention is by avoiding eating raw meat and boiling drinking water

INTRODUCTION
Pentastomiasis, also termed porocephalosis, linguatulosis, or linguatuliasis, is a zoonosis caused by pentastomids or pentastomes, now considered a subclass of maxillopod crustaceans [1]. The name pentastome derives from the appearance of two pairs of hooks above the mouth giving 'five mouths', while 'lingua' refers to the resemblance of  some  pentastomes  to  an  animal's  tongue,  hence  an  alternative name 'tongue worm'. Adults inhabit the respiratory  tracts of  their definitive vertebrate hosts - dogs and other carnivorous mammals in the case of Linguatula spp., and snakes and other reptiles in the case of Armillifer spp. They attach to respiratory tract epithelium by their peri-oral hooks and suck up blood and other tissues, tissue fluids, and secretions [2]. The more than 100 species belong to orders Cephalobaenida (e.g. genus Raillietiella ) and Porocephalida (e.g. genera Linguatula , Armillifer , Porocephalus, Leiperia and Sebekia ). More than ten species are recognized zoonotic parasites of humans [3, 4]. Visceral pentastomiasis is most often caused by Linguatula serrata or Armillifer armillatus. Nasopharyngeal  pentastomiasis  ('Halzoun'  or  'Marrara syndrome') is caused by L.  serrata .  Subcutaneous pentastomiasis is caused by Raillietella and Sebekia spp. [3].

LINGUATULA SPECIES
Linguatula serrata occurs in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and North, Central and South America, where canids are the definitive hosts. In some  parts  of  the  Middle  East,  more  than  50%  of  stray  dogs  are infected  with L.  serrata .  These  animals  harbor  adults  and  larvae  in their upper respiratory tracts and shed ova in their nasal secretions, saliva, and feces onto wet vegetation or into water. Ova are ingested by  herbivorous  intermediate  hosts  and  by  humans  who  can  be infected directly  by  contact  with  dogs' nasal secretions or contaminated food, developing visceral pentastomiasis and becoming intermediate  hosts.  Humans  can  also  be  infected  by  ingesting  infected offal  from  ruminants;  in  which  case,  they  develop  nasopharyngeal pentastomiasis  ('Halzoun'),  becoming  temporary  definitive  hosts. Linguatula ova hatch in the gut lumen releasing larvae which burrow into the tissues and encyst. When the intermediate hosts are eaten by carnivores, third-stage larvae hatch from the cysts and migrate to the lungs and nasopharynx where they mature.

============================================================
VISCERAL PENTASTOMIASIS
When humans ingest Linguatula ova, larvae hatch in the gut, burrow through its wall, migrate through the tissues and encyst mainly in the liver. Later larval stages can obstruct or compress biliary, gastrointestinal or respiratory tracts, meninges, brain, or the anterior chamber of the eye, causing iritis and secondary glaucoma.

============================================================
NASOPHARYNGEAL PENTOSTOMIASIS ('HALZOUN' IN LEBANON, 'MARRARA SYNDROME' IN THE SUDAN)
This follows ingestion of raw liver or lymph nodes from sheep, goats, cattle,  buffalo,  camels,  and  lagomorphs,  containing  encysted  or migrating third-stage larvae. Larvae migrate from the stomach up the esophagus to the nasopharynx mucosa [6, 7]. Within minutes to a few hours of eating the infected viscera, there is intense irritation of the  upper  respiratory  and  gastrointestinal  tracts  causing  coughing, sneezing,  rhinorrhea,  retching,  vomiting,  lacrimation,  hemoptysis, epistaxis, cervical lymphadenopathy, transient deafness, difficulty in speaking,  dysphagia,  wheezing,  dyspnea,  edema  of  the  face  and oropharynx, and urticaria. These clinical features suggest a hypersensitivity reaction. Wriggling larvae 5-10 mm long are found in sputum and vomitus. Patients who survive the acute upper airway obstruction usually recover in 1-2 weeks. Persistent infections are rare.

ARMILLIFER ( POROCEPHALUS ) SPECIES
These  annulated,  non-segmented  parasites  of  up  to  20  cm  long inhabit the respiratory and digestive tracts of snakes, lizards, crocodilians, and other vertebrates (Fig. 135.1). Human infections have been reported from Africa (especially West Africa), Southeast Asia, the Far East, and America. Ova shed in the snake's nasal secretions and picked up by rodents and other mammals hatch, releasing larvae that encyst in the tissues but will develop into nymphs if ingested by the definitive host. Humans may ingest ova by drinking water contaminated by snakes or by handling pet snakes (including pythons kept as revered peri-domestic totems in West Africa) and then licking their fingers.

Ova, larvae, and adult pentastomids may be ingested by eating raw snake as part of widespread ju ju rituals in west and central Africa and Southeast Asia, and for medicinal reasons in the Far East. In humans, ingested eggs hatch in the gut, releasing larvae that burrow into the tissues  where  they  encyst,  die  and  calcify  or  mature,  excyst  and migrate. Various species infect humans, including A. armillatus (Africa and Arabia) , Armillifer grandis (Africa), Armillifer moniliformis (Southeast Asia), Armillifer agkistrodonti [8] and Porocephalus taiwani (China) [9], Porocephalus crotali (USA) [10], and Leiperia cincinnalis (Africa).

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Judged by the discovery of calcified larvae in thoracic and abdominal radiographs, these infections can be prevalent in some parts of the world.  In  south-west  Nigeria,  they  were  seen  in  7%  of  men  aged 50-59 years, appearing as discrete, crescent-shaped, soft tissue calcifications,  4-8  mm  in  size,  especially  in  the  right  upper  quadrant because they are situated beneath the peritoneum covering the liver (Fig. 135.2). At autopsy, the prevalence exceeded 20% in some parts of Africa [1 1].

============================================================
CLINICAL FEATURES (POROCEPHALOSIS)
Infection is usually asymptomatic - the diagnosis being incidental by radiography or laparaotomy for other purposes or as a chance finding at autopsy. Mass migration of larvae from the gut into the tissue following  ingestion  of  many  ova  or  adult  female  pentastomes  may produce a variety of symptoms and signs, including fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, hepatosplenomegaly, and obstructive jaundice prompting laparotomy at which hundreds of wriggling nymphs may be discovered beneath the visceral peritoneum. Hemorrhagic enterocolitis and intestinal obstruction, secondary bacterial septicemia and pneumonia are described in the rare fatal cases [1 1, 12]. The peritoneum,  liver  and  biliary  tract,  lungs,  pleura,  pericardium,  central nervous  system,  and  anterior  chamber  of  the  eye  may  be  affected by  the  migrating  larvae,  leading  to  inflammatory  and  obstructive symptoms [13].

SUBCUTANEOUS PENTASTOMIASIS
Subcutaneous creeping eruptions, resembling cutaneous larva migrans or  larva  currens  have  been  associated  with Raillietella  hemidactyli

infections in Vietnam, resulting from ingestion of living lizards and with Sebekia spp. in Costa Rica [3].

INVESTIGATIONS
Severe infections are associated with neutrophil leukocytosis, sometimes  with  eosinophila  and  other  features  of  an  inflammatory response  and  anemia,  but  results  of  other  routine  investigations, including hepatic enzymes, are normal. The crescentic calcified pentastomid larvae produce a distinctive radiographic appearance. Unlike cysticerci,  they  are  not  found  in  muscle,  but  they  must  be  distinguished from calcified mesenteric lymph glands and calculi [14]. They are usually numerous and most dense in the lower lung fields and abdomen (especially the right upper quadrant) reflecting their subperitoneal  disposition.  Ultrasound  and  imaging  may  detect  hyperechoic/dense  lesions  in  the  peritoneum,  liver,  and  other  viscera, resembling tumors [15].

CHUNK 10
============================================================
DIAGNOSIS
Pentastomes  may  be  discovered  accidentally  in  the  liver,  intestinal wall and other tissues at surgery or autopsy [1 1]. Their macroscopic and histologic appearances are well-described [12, 16]. Pentastomids have also been identified by consensus PCR [10] and immunologic tests are being developed.

============================================================
CHUNK 11
============================================================
TREATMENT
There  is  no  proven  effective  chemotherapy  for  pentostomiasis,  but ivermectin,  praziquantel,  and  mebendazole  have  been  used  with apparent  success  in  individual  cases.  This  should  be  reserved  for severe and symptomatic cases. Obstruction and compression should be relieved surgically. Hypersensitivity phenomena (halzoun) should be treated with adrenaline (epinephrine), antihistamines, and corticosteroids.

============================================================
CHUNK 12
============================================================
PREVENTION
Pentostomiasis can be prevented by thoroughly cooking all meat of any origin, but especially of the key host species and boiling and/or filtering of drinking water. Eating sheep's lymph nodes is proscribed by the Shiite Moslems of Lebanon.
