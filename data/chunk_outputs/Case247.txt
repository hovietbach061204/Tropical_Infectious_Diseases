KEY FEATURES
- around a quarter of the world's population. The highest prevalence of anemia is in Africa and Southeast Asia, and it particularly affects pregnant women and young children.
- excessive loss of red cells or excessive red cell destruction (i.e. hemolysis). At least 50% of anemia is estimated to be due to iron de{ciency. Congenital defects of red cells, such as sickle cell trait and glucose6-phosphate dehydrogenase de{ciency, provide some protection against severe malaria.
- based on molecular, immunological and other features. Accurate classi{cation is important as it affects the prognosis and treatment, so diagnosis and management at a specialist center is recommended.
- and may be associated with an increased risk of either clotting or bleeding. Common acquired reasons for excessive bleeding include vitamin K de{ciency, obstetric complications, and platelet disorders such as immune thrombocytopenic purpura. The most common congenital causes of hemostatic problems include de{ciencies of clotting factors and von Willebrand's disease.

Epidemiology
Anemia is a major global health problem that affects health and intellectual capacity and consequently can have a measurable effect on economic development. Around 1.62 billion people are anemic worldwide-24%  of  the  global  population-with  the  highest prevalence in Africa and Southeast Asia 1 (T able 5.1). According the World Health Organization (WHO), at least 50% of global anemia is attributable to iron de{ciency. Health consequences of anemia include reduced adult work productivity, a negative effect on child development and cognition, increased risk of maternal/ child mortality, and increased post-operative mortality.

Anemia Reference Ranges
Hemoglobin (Hb) is highest at birth, decreasing to a minimum by about 2  months of age before increasing gradually through childhood to reach adult levels by puberty (T able 5.2). The lower normal limits for Hb are  13 for men and 12 g/dL for women. Ethnic differences have been described in Hb estimations; they may be 0.5 to 1 g/dL lower in black Americans than in socially comparable white counterparts. 2 Normal Hb concentration varies with age, sex, and pregnancy status and is also in|uenced by genetic

Hematologic Diseases
Stephen McKew, Imelda Bates, Edeghonghon Olayemi and environmental factors. Children and women of reproductive age have the highest prevalence of anemia (Fig. 5.1). In normal pregnancy an increase in plasma volume results in a progressive decrease in Hb, which returns to normal about a week after delivery. Altitude can increase Hb by approximately 0.25 g/dL per 1000 m above sea level.
Anemia can be caused by reduced production, excessive loss, or destruction of red cells. In this chapter, only causes of anemia with  particular  relevance  for  low-resourced  countries  will  be discussed.

Clinical Features
Anemia results in a reduction in oxygen delivered to tissues. Clinical manifestations  depend  on  the  rate  of  development  of  anemia, co-existent medical conditions, and the age of the patient. If the onset of anemia is insidious and there is no cardiorespiratory disease ( compensated anemia ),  the Hb can fall below 8 g/dL before symptoms become apparent, especially in children, who can tolerate severe anemia better than adults. In compensated anemia there are few symptoms at rest, although there may be pallor and breathlessness on exertion.  Cardiac  output  is  increased,  and  there  is  a  rise  in erythrocyte 2,3-diphosphoglycerate levels, which improves tissue oxygen delivery.  A severe reduction in Hb, particularly if this occurred acutely, can  be  associated  with  breathlessness  at  rest,  increased heart rate and cardiac output, and eventually heart failure ( decompensated anemia ). There may be severe breathlessness, angina, and claudication with pulmonary and peripheral edema, ascites, and hypotension. Mortality is high once heart failure occurs.

Diagnosis
The accurate diagnosis of anemia in a resource-poor setting is challenging if there is insuf{cient or unreliable laboratory support. Health care workers may use physical signs such as conjunctival and palmar pallor to diagnose anemia. 3 In patients with severe anemia, de{ned as an Hb < 7 g/dL, these signs can predict severe anemia with reasonable accuracy. However, they are not reliable in diagnosing mild and moderate anemia. Several portable technologies are available to aid in the diagnosis of anemia. The Hb color scale (HCS) is a rapid, cheap, and simple method of estimating Hb levels using a blood spot obtained from a {nger prick. It requires no laboratory support and can estimate the Hb concentration to within 1 gd/L. A meta-analysis has shown that the HCS can signi{cantly reduce the misdiagnosis of anemia compared with clinical assessment alone. 4 There are also point-of-care direct read-out tests that provide an accurate and rapid Hb measurement (e.g., HemoCue, Aptus) and are suitable for use where there is no laboratory.

Management of Different Types of Anemia
The cause of the anemia should be identi{ed and treated. Although transfusion usually rapidly corrects the anemia, it may exacerbate cardiac  failure  and  carries  signi{cant  infection  risks,  especially in  countries  with  weak  health  systems  and  high  prevalence  of transfusion-transmitted infections. In low-resource settings, anemia is often caused by several factors acting simultaneously, for example, malnutrition, hemoglobinopathies, and infections. 5,6 Some of these factors have a degree of interdependency, such as iron de{ciency and infection, which may explain why traditional single-treatment approaches  (e.g.,  iron  supplementation)  have  failed  to  make  a

Anemia Caused by Reduced Red Cell Production
Underproduction anemia can be caused by a lack of hematinics (such as iron, folate, vitamin B 12 , vitamin A, and ribo|avin) and/ or reduced bone marrow activity and is characterized by anemia with an inappropriately low reticulocyte count. Hematinic de{ciencies usually result from poor nutrition and, because the de{ciency develops gradually, quite severe degrees of anemia can be tolerated before signi{cant symptoms develop.
Iron De=ciency. Iron de{ciency is the result of many causes (T able 5.3)  and  may present  with  loss of melanin skin  pigmentation, angular stomatitis, glossitis, and koilonychia in very severe cases. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular Hb (MCH) are reduced, and hypochromia, microcytosis, and characteristic  'pencil cells' are evident on the blood {lm. Serum ferritin may be low, but as it is an acute-phase protein, the lower cut-off level may need to be raised in populations where infections are common. 7 Treatment is ferrous sulfate (200 mg, two to three times a day), and absorption can be improved by combining it with vitamin C. Ferrous sulfate given at lower doses or less frequently may reduce troublesome side effects such as constipation and nausea and therefore improve adherence. Treatment should be continued for 6 to 12 weeks once a normal Hb is achieved to replenish body stores. If oral iron cannot be tolerated, parenteral iron should be used rather than blood transfusion.  The underlying cause of the iron de{ciency should also be addressed.
Folate De=ciency. Although folate is found in many foods (e.g., liver,  green  vegetables,  tubers,  bananas),  de{ciency  is  relatively

Severe de{ciency is associated with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, and de{ciency in pregnancy can cause neural tube defects and intrauterine growth retardation.  Both  folate  de{ciency  and  B 12 de{ciency  cause hyperpigmentation of the skin, as well as an increase in MCV and neutrophil hypersegmentation on the blood {lm. Serum folate and serum vitamin B12 levels need to be measured to differentiate between these two de{ciencies. If these tests are not available, a trial  of  oral  folic  acid  5 mg/day  could  be  tried.

The clinical and hematologic picture of B12 de{ciency is similar to that of folate de{ciency but is associated with additional complications such as peripheral neuropathy, optic atrophy, psychiatric disturbance, and sub-acute combined degeneration of  the  cord.  Hyperpigmentation of  the  skin may  be  more pronounced than in folate de{ciency. Antibodies to intrinsic factor antibodies and gastric parietal cells may indicate pernicious anemia as the cause of B 12 de{ciency. The treatment of B12 de{ciency is usually with intramuscular injection of cyanocobalamin using a loading dose and then a maintenance dose of 1 mg every month. Oral cyanocobalamin 50-150 micrograms daily can be used but may not produce an adequate response.

In addition to causes of blood loss that occur commonly worldwide (e.g., peptic ulceration, bowel polyps, or cancer) there are infections such  as  hookworm,  trichuriasis,  and  schistosomiasis  that  occur predominantly in low-resource countries. These infections cause chronic blood loss from the bowel or urinary tract leading to ironde{ciency anemia. They may also exacerbate anemia by interfering with intestinal absorption (e.g., Strongyloides, Ascaris ) or by causing hypersplenism (e.g., intestinal schistosomiasis). Management consists of treating the underlying infection and replenishing iron stores. Blood transfusion should be avoided, as it may precipitate cardiac failure in the presence of long-standing chronic anemia.

Anemia of Inflammation
Anemia of in|ammation (also called anemia of chronic disease )  is associated with a wide range of infections, malignancies, or chronic in|ammatory  conditions  (T able  5.4).

It is characterized by low ferritin levels but ample reticuloendothelial iron  stored  in  the  bone  marrow  and other  tissues  and  reduced  erythropoiesis  in  the  bone  marrow. 8 The  blood  {lm  is  usually  normal  but  may  be  microcytic  and hypochromic in up to 25% of cases.

Anemia Caused by Excessive Red Cell Destruction (Hemolytic Anemias)
Red cells can be destroyed by abnormalities within the red cell (e.g., hemoglobinopathies, enzymopathies), abnormalities of the membrane (e.g., spherocytosis, elliptocytosis), or factors external to the red cell (e.g., drugs, antibodies, mechanical heart valves). Hemolytic anemias are characterized by anemia, jaundice, splenomegaly,  and  gallstones,  with  increased  reticulocyte  count, unconjugated bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase, and reduced haptoglobin. A direct Coombs test may be helpful in diagnosis, and treatment should be aimed at removing the underlying cause.

============================================================
Malaria
Anemia  can  occur  with  all  species  of  malaria  but  is  especially common with Plasmodium falciparum infection. The cause of the anemia is multifactorial and includes intracellular parasites, hypersplenism, and dyserythropoiesis caused by cytokine imbalance. 11 In malaria-endemic areas, anemia is most common in those with the highest prevalence of infection, such as young children and pregnant women. Anemia caused by malaria generally responds to anti-malarial treatment, but children need careful follow-up, as anemia may recur or only improve slowly. Blood transfusion should be limited to those who have signs of life-threatening complications of anemia, such as cardiac failure and severe tissue under-perfusion, and are unresponsive to other resuscitation measures.
Hyper-reactive malarial splenomegaly occurs in malaria-endemic areas, has a familial tendency, and affects women more than men. It is characterized by massive splenomegaly ( ≥ 10 cm) with hypersplenism and consequent pancytopenia, hepatomegaly, and raised immunoglobulin  M  levels. 12 T reatment  is  malarial  prophylaxis (usually proguanil hydrochloride 100 mg/day) though other antimalarials appropriate for long-term administration can be tried. The  presence  of  a  lymphocytosis  may  suggest  an  underlying lymphoma and should prompt referral to a specialist.

Visceral Leishmaniasis
Visceral leishmaniasis is associated with insidious onset of anemia and, eventually, pancytopenia primarily caused by hypersplenism. The diagnosis can be made by {nding macrophages containing marrow. The detection rate for parasites is higher in splenic aspirates ( > 95% positive compared with > 85% for bone marrow), but the splenic aspiration procedure is associated with a risk of death of ≈ 1%, making it less favored. T reatment should resolve the splenomegaly and hematologic abnormalities after several months.

Thalassemias
These are hereditary hemolytic anemias characterized by a genetic defect affecting the synthesis of one or more of the globin sub-units of the Hb molecule, most commonly the α or β globin chains ( α - and β - thalassemias). This leads to imbalanced globin chain production,  ineffective  erythropoiesis,  and  anemia  caused  by destruction of the abnormal red cells.

Thalassemia  is  classi{ed  by  the  clinical  severity  of  the disease. β -Thalassemia  major  is  the  most  severe  form  and  is characterized  by  transfusion-dependent  anemia.

The management of β -thalassemia major is complex and requires input from many specialties to deal with the complications and to provide psychological and social support  for  patients  and  their  families.  A  red  cell  transfusion every 2 to 4 weeks is the mainstay of management, aiming for an Hb of 9.5 to 10 g/dL. Although blood transfusions can slow the development of complications, iron overload is an inevitable consequence,  causing  endocrine  failure,  liver  {brosis,  cardiac dysfunction,  and  diabetes  mellitus.  Blood  transfusions  should therefore be utilized in conjunction with iron chelation if available (e.g.,  desferrioxamine (deferoxamine), deferiprone, deferasirox). Without transfusion, children may not survive beyond the age of 2 years, whereas those who receive intermittent transfusions may survive to early teenage years.

β -Thalassemia
Splenectomy may be helpful in patients with hypersplenism and  worsening  anemia.  Because  of  the  risk  of  infection  with encapsulated organisms, it is advisable to delay splenectomy until the child is 4 to 5 years old. They should have the relevant vaccinations at least 2 weeks before elective splenectomy and started on lifelong penicillin prophylaxis in accordance with local guidelines for asplenic patients. Stem cell transplantation from a well-matched sibling  donor  has  a  high  success  rate  and,  in  the  long  term,  a closely matched transplant is probably more cost-effective than a transfusion-chelation regimen.
β -Thalassemia Intermedia. β -Thalassemia intermedia produces non-transfusion-dependent anemia with Hb levels of 5 to 9 g/dL. Patients  present  later  than  those  with β -thalassemia  major  and have  similar,  but  less  severe,  complications  and  hematologic abnormalities. The need for regular blood transfusions is guided by the clinical condition of the patient, so growth, skeletal abnormalities, and spleen size should be monitored. Transfusion may be required intermittently during periods of stress (e.g., infections, rapid growth, and pregnancy) or during aplastic crises.
β -Thalassemia Trait. β -Thalassemia trait is usually asymptomatic with no or only very mild anemia. The MCV and MCH are markedly reduced, and the blood {lm is hypochromic and microcytic.

α -Thalassemia
The α -thalassemias are common throughout the Mediterranean, sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, India, southern China, and Indonesia, but sporadic mutations occur in all populations (see Fig. 5.2). As α genes are duplicated, there are four genes ( αα / αα ) responsible for production of the α
α genes  ( -α )  results  in α + -thalassemia,  with  reduced α chain production,  whereas  deletion  of  both  genes  (-  -)  results  in α 0 -thalassemia, with absent α chain production. The excess γ and β chains form γ tetramers in fetal life (Hb Bart's) and β tetramers in adult life (HbH), respectively, which damage red cells leading to hemolysis and reduced erythropoiesis.
The α gene mutations result in four clinical conditions across a  spectrum  of  severity:  silent  carrier, α -thalassemia  trait,  HbH disease, and Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis.
Silent Carrier (α / αα ). This is usually associated with a completely normal blood count and blood {lm or a trivial microcytic anemia.
α -Thalassemia Trait (α /-α or  -/ αα ). This is usually asymptomatic, but there may be mild microcytic anemia.
Hemoglobin H Disease (-/α ). HbH is common in Southeast Asia and around the Mediterranean but occurs rarely in those of African  descent.  Most  patients  have  Hb  7  to  10 g/L  with  few symptoms  and  mild  hepatosplenomegaly.  They  may  require occasional transfusions during pregnancy or episodes of infection. The blood {lm (Fig. 5.4) shows extreme variation in red cell size and shape, as well as hypochromia, microcytosis, polychromasia, and basophilic stippling. Staining with brilliant cresyl blue demonstrates the characteristic 'golf-ball' HbH inclusions in up to 90% of red cells. Hemoglobin electrophoresis and HPLC show increased HbH ( < 40%) with reduced HbA2.

Sickle Cell Hemoglobinopathies
Sickle hemoglobin (HbS) is caused by a mutation in the β globin gene,  which  affects  the  stability  and  solubility  of  the β chain. When HbS is deoxygenated (e.g., during in|ammation, infection, dehydration, or hypoxia) it polymerizes and distorts the red cell, eventually resulting in the characteristic sickle shape. The red cell

HbS is  found  in  high  frequency  in Africa  and  areas  in  the Middle East, where the prevalence can reach > 30%. HbS occurs in parts of the world where P. falciparum malaria is endemic, and it  now  has  a  global  distribution  contributed  to  initially  by  the trans-Atlantic slave trade and now by modern travel and migration. Individuals with sickle cell trait (HbAS) have 10-fold protection against severe malaria compared with individuals with normal Hb.

These  are  mostly  sickle  cell  anemia  (HbSS),  but  include hemoglobin  SC  disease  (HbSC)  and  sickle  beta  thalassemia (HbS/ β + ). In these infants, symptoms such as hemolytic anemia, splenomegaly, and vaso-occlusive episodes become apparent after the {rst 6 months of life as the protective effect of HbF is lost. The age of onset of symptoms is variable, but most children will experience  problems by the age  of 6 years. Without treatment children with HbSS are stunted, with bossing of the bones of the skull similar to that seen in β -thalassemia (Fig. 5.5). Both conditions cause expansion of the bone marrow, which is the cause of the bossing and other abnormalities of development of the facial bones. When HbS is  co-inherited  with  other  Hb  abnormalities  (e.g., HbSC and HbS/ β + Cells containing HbSS form sickle-shaped cells in tissues where there  is  low  oxygen  tension.

Diagnosis. The blood count is normal at birth but Hb falls during the {rst year of life. The adult Hb is 6 to 10 g/L but can drop to less  than 2 g/L during a crisis.  Blood  {lms (Fig. 5.6) show the typical  sickle  cells,  as  well  as  target  cells,  polychromasia,  and nucleated red cells.

A  positive  test indicates the presence of Hb S but does not differentiate between sickle cell trait). A blood {lm is not a reliable way to differentiate be very few sickled cells. False-negative sickle screening tests can occur  if  the  patient  is  very  anemic  (ideally  use  packed  cells  to avoid this), if the reagents are out of date, if the infant is less than 6 months old, or if the patient has had a recent transfusion.

Hydroxycarbamide/ hydroxyurea  is  generally  well  tolerated  and  associated  with prolonged survival.

The neutrophil count  should  be  monitored  regularly  and  the  dose  reduced  if the neutrophil count falls. The need for regular monitoring of the blood count means that in some resource-limited countries there has been a poor uptake of hydroxycarbamide so trials are ongoing to assess  the  effect  of low-dose hydroxycarbamide. As in β -thalassemia major, a well-matched bone marrow transplant, even from a sibling with HbAS, may be the most cost-effective management strategy.

Dactylitis. Typically the bones of the hands and feet are affected with fever and leukocytosis. It is often the first event in young children and can occur multiple times until the age of 3 years.
Painful crises. Typically occurs after the first few years in bones or occasionally abdominal viscera. Pain is due to ischemia and can be very severe. Crises are associated with low-grade fever and mild leukocytosis compared with osteomyelitis, where fever and leukocytosis are more pronounced. Pain relief with paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or opioids, as appropriate, should be instigated immediately. Supportive measures such as hydration, intravenously if necessary, and oxygen also help to reduce the duration of the pain crisis. Any precipitating cause such as infection should be treated.
Central nervous system events. Strokes occur in up to 17% of children and young adults. The pathogenesis is unclear, but angiography often shows occlusions or stenosis. Recurrence is likely unless a long-term transfusion program is initiated.
Acute chest syndrome. This is a common cause of death presenting with fever, tachypnea, chest pain, and leukocytosis, often with a sudden drop in hemoglobin. It can be difficult to differentiate from infection, infarction, and embolism. Common precipitating causes are pulmonary fat embolism and infections. Treatment is with transfusion (simple or exchange), antibiotics, and aggressive treatment of hypoxia.
Splenic sequestration. This occurs in children between 6 months and 2 years. It is caused by sudden trapping of red cells within the spleen producing a sudden drop in hemoglobin and rapidly enlarging spleen, eventually leading to hypovolemic shock and death. Management includes early detection of the rapidly enlarging spleen and blood transfusion.
Priapism. Engorgement of the penis can be short-lived and selfterminating or can last in excess of 24 hours and may lead to impotence. Initial management is with fluids and analgesia, but persistent priapism ( > 12 hours) may need partial exchange transfusion and corporal aspiration.

Sickle Cell Trait
Individuals with sickle cell trait (HbAS) are generally asymptomatic with  a  normal  Hb  and  normal  life  expectancy.  Complications are very uncommon but can include poor perfusion of the renal papillae and increased bacteriuria. 14 The blood {lm is either normal electrophoresis or HPLC. The sickle solubility test is positive.
Hemoglobin Sickle Cell Disease. Hemoglobin sickle cell (SC) disease results from the inheritance of HbS from one parent and HbC from the other. The highest prevalence is in West Africa. The clinical  features  are  similar  to  those  of  HbSS  anemia  but slightly less severe. Splenic perfusion remains intact into adulthood, and so splenomegaly, splenic infarcts, and splenic sequestration can present in adulthood. Regular ophthalmic review should be undertaken, as proliferative retinopathy may start in the second decade of life.
Anemia is less marked in HbSC than in HbSS (80-140 g/L). The blood {lm in HbSC differs from that in HbSS, as there are fewer sickle cells and more target cells, and rhomboid HbC crystals may be seen within ghost cells. The sickle solubility test is positive due to the presence of HbS, and diagnosis can be con{rmed by Hb electrophoresis or HPLC.
Hemoglobin  S β -Thalassemia. The  severity  of  the  clinical condition resulting from double heterozygous inheritance of HbS and β -thalassemia  depends  on  the  amount  of β globin  chain production. If there is no or minimal production (S β 0 ), the clinical picture is similar to HbSS.

Pancytopenia is a reduction in more than one type of blood cell and should raise the suspicion of vitamin B12 or folate de{ciency, leukemia, aplastic anemia, or infections.

Acute Leukemias
Acute  lymphoblastic  leukemia  (ALL)  and  acute  myeloblastic leukemia (AML) have different epidemiologic patterns in lower- and
high-resourced countries. ALL occurs most commonly in childhood and  accounts  for ≈ 80% of  leukemias  in  children  aged  0  to  14 years. The peak incidence is 5 to 14 years of age in sub-Saharan Africa-a later onset compared with high-resourced countries due to delayed exposure to infection and possibly less breastfeeding. The incidence of AML is stable worldwide at 1 to 5 cases per 100,000 per year. 17 Risk  factors  for AML include smoking and exposure  to  chemicals  and  alkylating  agents.  Note  that  severe vitamin B12 de{ciency may mimic AML.
Diagnosis. In both ALL and AML the white cell count is usually raised  because  of  the  presence  of  blast  cells,  though  occasionally it can be reduced, and the Hb and platelet count are often reduced. A blood {lm will usually show blast cells, but occasionally they may be absent or very infrequent. In children the clinical features and blood {lm of acute viral infection may mimic ALL, and a leukemoid reaction mimicking AML may occur in severe tuberculosis. Cytochemical stains of peripheral blood with Sudan black,  myeloperoxidase,  and  non-speci{c  esterase  can  help  differentiate  between  ALL  and  myelomonocytic  and  monocytic AML.

Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is commonly associated with the Philadelphia chromosome t(9;22). This translocation results in the production of an abnormal tyrosine kinase-like protein that alters cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival in several cell lines.  CML appears to  occur uniformly throughout the  world; incidence increases from late childhood. In poorer countries where populations are younger compared with more wealthy countries, CML is more commonly seen in those under 40. The clinical onset is insidious, with symptoms caused by anemia and hypercatabolic effects  such  as  progressive  fatigue  and  weight  loss.  Abdominal discomfort caused by splenomegaly and hepatomegaly is common.
Diagnosis. An increase in white cells, predominantly mature and immature neutrophils, of up to 500 × 10 9 /L can occur, accompanied by anemia and occasionally increased platelets. A de{nitive diagnosis depends  on  a  specialist  laboratory  demonstrating  the 9;22 (Philadelphia) translocation by cytogenetics or in situ hybridization. Many in|ammatory and infectious conditions can cause a reactive increased neutrophil count with immature forms, which can mimic CML. The  absence  of  a  basophilia  and  the  presence  of  toxic granulation  of  the  neutrophils  in  these  reactive  conditions  can help to differentiate them from CML.

Chronic  lymphocytic  leukemia  (CLL)  usually  originates  from mature B lymphocytes. Incidence increases with age, and there is a male predominance of 2 : 1.

Symptoms  include  fever  and weight  loss  with  lymphadenopathy,  splenomegaly,  and  anemia, and there is an increased risk of infections.
Investigations. In  CLL  there  is  usually  a  lymphocytosis  of > 5 × 10 9 /L,  which occasionally can  be  as high as  400 × 10 9 /L. Autoimmune anemia and thrombocytopenia can occur. The blood {lm  shows  excessive  numbers  of  mature  lymphocytes.  These cells  are  fragile  and  appear  smeared  (i.e., 'smear'  cells)  on  the blood {lm. The diagnosis is con{rmed by immunophenotyping, which  differentiates  CLL  from  other  causes  of  lymphocytosis. 'African CLL,' which is associated with lymphocytosis and occurs predominantly in young women in Africa, is now thought to be a type of splenic lymphoma possibly related to chronic immune stimulation by malaria.

The clinical presentation of NHL is variable, with more patients presenting with extranodal disease compared in Africa accounting for about a third of pediatric malignancies. The  incidence  of  various  types  of  NHL  (including  Burkitt's lymphoma) has been rising due to their association with HIV/ worldwide.

Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura
Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is caused by immune destruction of platelets. Although it is usually primary, it can be associated  with  underlying  conditions  such  as  lymphomas  and infections  including  HIV.  It  may  present  incidentally  or  with bruising or bleeding. Petechiae or bleeding from the nose or gums is  more likely if the platelet count is < 30 × 10 9 /L. Spontaneous recovery occurs more often in children than in adults.
There is no speci{c test for ITP , but increased  numbers of platelet  precursors  in  the  bone  marrow  support  a  diagnosis  of ITP. It is important to exclude other causes of thrombocytopenia, if  the  platelet  count  drops well below 30 × 10 9 /L or if there is bleeding.  T reatment  is  initially  with  corticosteroids  such  as prednisolone at doses of 0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg, which should be tapered off  over  several  weeks  once  the  platelet  count  has  improved. Second-line  treatment  includes  immunosuppressive  agents  and danazol. Splenectomy may result in a long-term improvement in platelet count, but the bene{ts need to be balanced against the risks of splenectomy, particularly in settings where infections are common.  Intravenous  immunoglobulin  (IVIG)  can  be  used  to increase  the  platelet  count  in  an  emergency  or  before  surgical procedures. For severe bleeding, combinations of platelet transfusion, IVIG, and high-dose steroids may be considered.

Several laboratory tests are  required  to  determine  the  cause  and  classify  the  type  of thrombophilia.  Interpretation  of  the  results,  understanding  the limitations of the tests, and explaining the implications to patients require considerable expertise and should be done by specialists.
