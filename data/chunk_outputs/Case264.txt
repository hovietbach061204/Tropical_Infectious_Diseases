(icaridin). 18 At the public health level, a sustained and integrated vector-control strategy is generally needed to consistently reduce A. aegypti population densities. A. aegypti mosquitoes proliferate in many peri-domestic water-containing habitats. These include purposely {lled man-made containers (e.g., water storage barrels, |owerpots/vases), rain-{lled objects (e.g., used tires), and natural habitats (e.g., tree holes).
Dengue vaccine development has moved forward with encouraging advances. Given the potential for increased disease severity upon sequential infection with heterologous DENV serotypes, a general consensus has been that effective vaccination strategies will  require  simultaneous  immunization  to  the  four  DENV serotypes (tetravalent vaccines). A chimeric live-attenuated viral vaccine, where the DENVs 1 to 4 envelope proteins have been engineered onto a yellow fever (YF)-17D vaccine backbone,  is licensed in several countries. However, if this vaccine is administered to truly dengue-naïve individuals, it appears to be able to enhance the subsequent disease severity with a natural DENV infection. Another  tetravalent  live-attenuated  dengue  vaccine  (attenuated by a deletion in the DENV2 3' untranslated region [UTR]) is in phase III clinical trials. Other dengue vaccine products that are in  pre-clinical  or  early  clinical  phases  include  an  adjuvanted recombinant envelope protein vaccine, an adjuvanted inactivated virus vaccine, and a plasmid DNA vaccine. The combination of effective  dengue  vaccination  with  vector-control  strategies  will open up the possibility of severely halting, or even eradicating, DENV transmission in many endemic regions.

INTRODUCTION
Chikungunya (CHIK) fever is an arboviral disease that is characterized by the rapid onset of high fever, rash, and severe joint pain (Fig. 36.2.1). Its name is derived from the Makonde word meaning 'that which bends up' in reference to the stooped posture that develops as a result of the arthritic symptoms of the disease. The disease is nearly always self-limiting. 1 The causative agent, chikungunya virus (CHIKV), is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the family T ogaviridae , genus Alphavirus. Molecular characterization has demonstrated three distinct genotypes (West African, Central/East African, and Asian)  that historically  were  geographically  limited  to  Africa  and  Asia. 2 Recent spread has made the pathogen a nearly  global  concern (Fig. 36.2.2). A zoonotic cycle is known to exist in Africa involving a range of vertebrate hosts, including non-human primates, and  forest-dwelling Aedes  (Stegomyia) mosquitoes.  The  virus  is transmitted to humans primarily by Aedes aegypti and A. albopictus mosquitoes.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
The {rst recorded epidemic occurred in T anzania in 1952-1953. In Asia, CHIKV was {rst detected in Bangkok, Thailand, in 1958. In India, well-documented outbreaks occurred in 1963 and 1964 in Calcutta and southern India, respectively. Thereafter, a small outbreak  of  CHIK  was  reported  from  the  Sholapur  district, Maharashtra, in 1973. 3 Cases of CHIK continued to be reported in Africa and Southeast Asia, although no additional major outbreaks were  reported  for  nearly  three  decades.  The  virus  emerged  in East Africa (Kenya) and the islands of the Indian Ocean, including Comoros, La Reunion, Mayotte, Mauritius, and Seychelles, beginning in 2004. 4-6 CHIKV then re-emerged in India in December 2005. The 2005-2006 outbreak in India involved approximately 1.35 million suspected cases in 12 states. The attack rate reached up to 45% due to the lack of herd immunity, a large susceptible population, and the ability of certain strains containing an alanine to valine mutation in the E1 gene to more ef{ciently infect the secondary vector, A. albopictus . 3
Imported cases of CHIKV infection were reported from Europe and North and South America in returning travelers from areas with  high  incidence  rates. 7 In  2013  the  virus  emerged  in  the Caribbean island of St. Martin and quickly spread throughout the Caribbean and Latin America. In the {rst year alone in the Americas, an estimated > 1 million cases occurred in over 40 countries (Fig. 36.2.3).  Although  massive  outbreaks  have  subsided,  the  virus continues to circulate on a nearly global scale.

PATHOGENESIS
After  the  bite  of  an  infected  mosquito,  the  virus  replicates  in {broblasts and epithelial cells leading to a viremia that can reach up to 8 log10/mL. The skin, joints, and muscles are the primary affected organs, whereas the nervous system, heart, and liver are less frequently involved. Macrophage appear to be susceptible to infection during the viremic phase. Mouse models have shown that type 1 interferon response appears to be associated with control of infection. 8

============================================================
CLINICAL FEATURES
CHIK is an acute infection of abrupt onset, heralded by high fever and severe arthralgia, followed by other constitutional symptoms and rash (typically maculopapular) lasting for a period of 1 to 7 days. The incubation period is usually 3 to 7 days, with a range of 2 to 12 days. Fever rises abruptly, often reaching 39°C to 40°C. This acute phase lasts a few days to 2 weeks. 9 In some cases, the temperature may remit for 1 to 2 days after a gap of 4 to 10 days, resulting in a 'saddle back' fever curve that is characteristic of arthropod-borne virus infections.
The arthralgias are polyarticular, symmetric, and predominantly affect the small joints of the hands, wrists, ankles, and feet (see Fig. 36.2.1) with lesser involvement of larger joints. During the acute phase, joint pain can be incapacitating. Patients with milder articular  manifestations  are  usually  symptom  free  within  a  few

CLINICAL FEATURES
weeks, but more severe cases require months or years to resolve entirely. 10 One study indicated that one third of patients had chronic joint symptoms that persisted for at least 9 months. 11 Cutaneous manifestations are typical with many patients. This is usually a maculopapular rash, but bullous lesions can occur in infants. The trunk and limbs are most commonly involved, but the face, palms, and soles may also show lesions. During the acute phase, some patients will have headache, but it is not usually severe, and retro-orbital pain, commonly found in dengue infections, rarely occurs. Conjunctival redness is present in some cases. Pregnant women can pass the virus to their infant, most commonly during the intrapartum phase. The Reunion South Hospital Group observed 84 pregnant women who had laboratory-con{rmed CHIK infection. In 88% of these women (all involving infections relatively distant from delivery), the newborns appeared asymptomatic. Conversely, 10 newborns developed disease soon after birth (4 with meningoencephalitis and 3 with intravascular coagulation) and required intensive care support. 12 Severe cases of CHIK, including neurologic complications, myocarditis, or nephritis, can occur, most commonly in the elderly, newborns, and immunocompromised individuals. 13,14 CHIK outbreaks typically result in several hundred or thousands of cases, but deaths are rarely encountered.

DIAGNOSIS
Symptoms of CHIKV infection can be clinically indistinguishable from dengue fever. Other causes in the differential diagnosis of CHIK include malaria, O'nyong nyong, Sindbis, Ross River, West Nile, and Zika virus infections. 9,15,16
The clinical laboratory {ndings in CHIK are not remarkable. A few patients may present with  leukopenia with relative lymphocytosis; however, most patients will have normal blood counts. The platelet count may be moderately depressed. The erythrocyte sedimentation  rate  and  C-reactive  protein  levels  are  typically elevated in acute cases. 15 A de{nitive diagnosis can only be made by laboratory testing, but CHIK should be suspected when epidemic disease  occurs  with  the  characteristic  triad  of  fever,  rash,  and arthralgia.
Virus-speci{c IgM antibodies typically can be detected by 5 to  7  days  of  illness  using  enzyme-linked  immunosorbent  assay (ELISA). Because viremia is so high and persists for several days post-illness onset, blood samples for virus isolation and reverse transcriptase  polymerase  chain  reaction  (RT-PCR)  should  be collected within the {rst 5 days of illness when viremia is detectable. Frequently, diagnosis can be de{nitively con{rmed by virus isolation or molecular techniques such as RT-PCR, for which a wide range of tests now exist. 17

TREATMENT
There is no speci{c treatment for CHIK. The illness is usually self-limiting and resolves with time. Supportive care with rest is

indicated during the acute joint symptoms. Movement and mild exercise may decrease stiffness and arthralgia, but heavy exercise may  exacerbate  rheumatic  symptoms.  Aspirin  and  other  nonsteroidal  anti-in|ammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are recommended for chronic pain. A number of therapeutic options are in development, as are several vaccine candidates. 18
Because no vaccine or speci{c medication is yet available against CHIKV infection, vector control is very important in controlling or preventing transmission. Elimination of breeding sites or source reduction is an important control approach. A. aegypti is typically a container-habitat species (Fig. 36.2.4) and breeds primarily in arti{cial  containers  and  receptacles.  Therefore  all  water  tanks, cisterns, barrels, trash containers, etc., need to be covered tightly with a lid. Old tires, tin cans, buckets, drums, bottles, etc., should be removed, as mosquitoes may breed in these containers if they accumulate water. In ornamental garden water tanks, larvivorous {sh  (e.g . ,  gambusia,  guppy)  can  be  introduced.  In  case  water containers cannot be emptied on a daily or weekly basis, larvicidal treatments can be applied. 19
Both primary vectors, A. aegypti and A. albopictus, are principally daytime biters. Insect repellant containing N,N -diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) or another registered active ingredient should be applied on exposed skin (T able 36.2.1). People should be advised to wear long sleeves and pants and have secure screens on windows and doors  to  keep  mosquitoes  out.  Insecticide-treated  bed  net  use during daytime resting can help prevent mosquito bites. Infected persons  should  be  protected  from  further  mosquito  exposure (staying indoors and/or under a mosquito net during the {rst few days of illness) so that they cannot contribute to the transmission cycle.
