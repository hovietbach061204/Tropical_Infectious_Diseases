female is 33 mm long with vulva and anus located near the caudal end; the male is 20 mm long with a copulatory bursa and two spicules approximately  300 μ m in  length  [2].  Eggs  are  released  within  the mesenteric arteries and carried by the blood into the intestinal wall, where  they  embryonate  (Fig.  1 19.1).  First-stage  larvae  hatch  and migrate through the intestinal wall. They are excreted in the rat's feces and reach the soil, where they are eaten by the intermediate hostusually slugs. Two molts take place in the mollusk and, after 18 days, the infective third-stage larva matures. The definitive host, usually the cotton  rat,  becomes  infected  by  eating  the  mollusk.  The  prepatent period lasts 24 days [3].
In Costa Rica, the cotton rat, Sigmodon hispidus , is the most important host, but at least 12 different species of rat and one coati have been found to be naturally infected. Marmosets and two rodents have been found  infected  with A.  costaricensis in  eastern  Peru  and  southern Brazil, respectively [4].
Although several mollusks are naturally infected with A. costaricensis , veronicellid slugs are  considered  the main  intermediate  hosts. Humans become infected when they ingest slugs or food items contaminated with small mollusks or their secretions, for example small slugs hidden in salad greens could be finely chopped and inadvertently eaten raw. Several cases have followed ingestion of mollusks by infants. Most human infections are probably caused by ingestion of the infective larvae shed in the mollusk's secretions (Fig. 1 19.1). Slugs have been found in ripe fruits that have fallen to the ground. Characteristic mucous trails left by the mollusks can be observed throughout endemic areas. The propensity for small children to put things in their mouths could explain why they have the highest infection rates.

At  least  two  species  of  veronicellid  slugs  in  Costa  Rica  ( Saranisula plebeia and Diplosolenodes  occidentalis )  and  several  species  in  Brazil ( Phyllocaulis variegatus and Sarasinula  linguaeformis ,  among  other species)  are  naturally  infected  with A.  costaricensis .  Fifty  percent  of 6025 slugs from 20 Costa Rican localities, from sea level to an altitude of  2000  meters,  were  found  to  be  infected  and  more  than  16,000 infected larvae were counted in a single specimen.
In  most  cases,  lesions  caused  by A.  costaricensis are  located  in  the ileocecal region. They also occur in the hepatic flexure and descending colon, regional lymph nodes, liver, and testicles. Two major pathogenic mechanisms are present : (i) the adult worms living within the mesenteric arteries  (Fig.  1 19.2)  damage  the  endothelium,  inducing thrombosis and, consequently, necrosis of the tissues perfused by the vessels;  and  (ii)  eggs,  embryos,  and  larvae,  as  well  as  excretionsecretion products, cause inflammatory reactions. These features, as well as the patient's susceptibility and the number and localization of parasites, determine the pathophysiology of the infection.

INTRODUCTION
Abdominal angiostrongylosis, caused by Angiostrongylus costaricensis is characterized by a granulomatous inflammatory reaction with heavy eosinophilic infiltration of the intestinal wall, especially in the ileocecal region. The disease has been observed in Costa Rica since 1952; since 1971, it has been reported from most countries of the Americas, especially Central and South America. In addition, cotton rats naturally infected with the parasite have been found in the USA.

============================================================
EPIDEMIOLOGY
The disease has been reported from the USA to Argentina, including some Caribbean islands. One human case has been reported from Africa. In Costa Rica, its distribution is universal, from sea level to an altitude of 2000 meters. With the first recognition of A. costaricensis until the mid-1980s, 20-60 cases were reported annually. Secondary to  better  identification  of  the  disease  by  medical  personnel,  the annual incidence increased to 600 cases per year (20 cases per 100,000 inhabitants). Improvements in sanitation and mollusk control since 2000 have decreased the number of cases to about 185 cases/year over the last 10 years.

NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
Angiostrongylus  costaricensis is  a  filariform  nematode normally living within the mesenteric arteries of the definitive host-a rodent. The

granulomatous inflammatory reactions (Fig. 1 19.3A) with heavy eosinophilic infiltration, especially in the intestinal mucosa and submucosa;  the  serosa  and  muscular  layers  are  often  involved  to  a  lesser degree. Eggs ( Fig. 1 19.3B), embryos, and larvae are in small cavities lined by endothelium. Unfertilized eggs usually degenerate and are difficult  to  recognize.  These  structures,  as  well  as  the  excretionsecretion  antigens,  are  easily  identified  by  immunochemical  techniques. Large areas of necrosis are caused by arterial thrombosis.

EXTRAINTESTINAL LESIONS
Eggs and embryos are present in the mesenteric lymph nodes, which show  reticuloendothelial  hyperplasia  and  eosinophilic  infiltration. Hepatic lesions caused by A. costaricensis are similar to those caused by Toxocara canis (Chapter  1 16).  However  the  finding  of  eggs
(Fig. 1 19.3C), larvae and even adult worms in the hepatic parenchyma establishes  the  diagnosis.  In  excised  testicles,  worms  have  been observed obstructing the arteries of the spermatic cord and there can be extensive parenchymal hemorrhagic necrosis.

CLINICAL FEATURES
Abdominal angiostrongylasis predominantly affects children. Among 116 patients studied in a pediatric hospital, 50% were school age, 40% were preschool age and 10% were infants; two-thirds were male [5]. When worms are located in the ileocecal region, most patients complain of pain in the right iliac fossa and the right flank. Palpation in this area often causes pain. Rectal examination is also painful in about one-half of the patients and most patients present with fever of 3838.5°C, rarely accompanied by chills. In chronic cases, a mild fever

may persist for several weeks. Anorexia, vomiting, and constipation are also present in about half the patients.
An important finding is the palpation of a tumor-like mass in the right  lower  quadrant  that  can  be  confused  with  a  malignancy. Although a few patients have no hematologic abnormalities, leukocytosis and eosinophilia are usually present. White blood cell counts usually  range  between  15,000  and  50,000/mm 3 and  eosinophilia from 20-50%. The leukocytosis has been as high as 169,000/mm 3 , with a 91% eosinophilia.

EXTRAINTESTINAL FINDINGS
Sometimes the patient complaints of pain in the right upper quadrant.  In  these  cases,  the  liver  is  almost  always  enlarged  and  tender to palpation. At laparoscopy, small yellowish spots (granulomas) are seen on the surface of the liver. Most patients have hepatic involvement  along  with  intestinal  angiostrongyliasis.  When  the  testicle is  involved,  the  patient  experiences  acute  pain,  accompanied  by redness and then purple discoloration. Eosinophilia and leukocytosis are also conspicuous. All patients with testicular necrosis have been misdiagnosed  as  having  testicular  torsion-the  correct  diagnosis being made only following surgery.

PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The clinical diagnosis is based on characteristic features. The symptoms and findings can be confused with those of appendicitis-the appendix is frequently involved, with the diagnosis made at surgery. Radiologic  or  other  imaging  can  demonstrate  suggestive  findings usually localized in the terminal ileum, cecum, appendix, and ascending  colon.  Studies  using  contrast  medium  show  incomplete  filling and irritability  of  the  involved  areas.  The  lumen  is  reduced  by  the thickening of the intestinal wall and often resembles colon carcinoma (Fig. 1 19.4). Laboratory diagnosis can involve both ELISA and PCR [6]. A latex agglutination test has high sensitivity and specificity and can be performed in small laboratories. Eggs and larvae do not appear in the stools.

TREATMENT
Surgery  is  sometimes  required  for  abdominal  angiostrongyliasis. However, as knowledge of this often self-limiting disease increases, more  cases  have  been  followed  without  surgery.  Two  drugsdiethycarbamazine and thiabendazole-have been used, but there are no clinical trials demonstrating efficacy [7]. In vitro and in vivo trials in  experimentally  infected  rats  demonstrate  that  parasites  can  be excited, rather than killed, by the drugs, causing erratic migrations and worsening of the lesions. Thus, chemotherapy is not recommended until experimental studies demonstrate a more efficacious drug.
