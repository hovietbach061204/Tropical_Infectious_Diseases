other ulcerative STIs became possible. The first full description of LGV was given in 1913 by Durand, Nicolas and Favré. The introduction of an intradermal skin test by Frei in 1925 allowed a distinct diagnosis of  lesions,  formerly  called  'climatic'  or  'tropical  bubo'  and  connected the late complications of elephantiasis and rectal stricture with LGV. With the isolation and culture of chlamydiae in the 1930s and the introduction of specific serologic tests in the 1960s, the natural history  of  LGV could  be  fully  described.  Advances  in  immunology and molecular biology in the last decades of the 20th century led to a new understanding of the disease. DNA amplification tests began to replace cell culture as the gold standard of diagnosis.
Chlamydiae are highly specialized, obligate, intracellular  Gramnegative bacteria, with a unique reproductive cycle (see Chapter 48, 'Chlamydial infections'). Whereas the other serotypes of C. trachomatis all produce superficial epithelial infections of mucous membranes in the eyes, genitalia or respiratory system, serotypes L1-L3 (the 'LGV strains') display a distinct invasive behavior in lymphatic tissue. They grow rapidly in cell culture, show enhanced resistance to phagocytosis and kill mice after intracerebral inoculation.
LGV is primarily a lymphatic disease. Chlamydia gain access to lymphatic vessels through microtrauma of the skin or mucous membranes. Being partly  the  result  of  an  excessive  T-cell  mediated  immune  response, the leading pathologic feature of LGV is a progressive thrombolymphangitis. Endothelial cells along the lymphatic vessel walls proliferate, finally causing stenosis and obstruction, and the inflammatory reaction  spreads  to  the  surrounding  tissue.  Regional  lymph  nodes  are invaded by neutrophils and mononuclear macrophages, leading to granuloma formation and the characteristic three- or four-cornered 'stellate' microabscesses, finally resolving in progressive fibrosis and scarring.  Although  the  immune  system  is  capable  of  suppressing chlamydial  replication,  it  usually  cannot  completely  eradicate  the organism that can persist for decades in local lesions [3].

CLINICAL FEATURES
LGV is a systemic disease with three distinct stages. The clinical features  vary  according  to  gender  and  sexual  practices  of  the  patient. Immunosuppression, for example underlying HIV disease, seems to result in more severe and prolonged symptoms.

PRIMARY LYMPHOGRANULOMA VENEREUM (LGV)
A  small  papule,  erosion  or  ulcer  develops  at  the  site  of  infection (usually  penis,  labia,  vulva  or  cervix)  after  an  incubation  period varying from 3 to 30 days. The initial lesion is inconspicuous and may resemble herpes simplex infection, but is usually painless. It is more often seen in men, with a ratio of four men to every woman, and heals spontaneously after a few days.
Other  locations  of  primary  LGV  are  the  anus,  rectum  or  urethra. Extragenital  manifestations  are  rare-the  best  known  being  a  conjunctivitis with pre-auricular lymphadenopathy and lymphedema of the eyelid ('Parinaud's oculoglandular syndrome'), usually following autoinfection.

Key features
- Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a sexually transmitted disease caused by the invasive intracellular bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis serotypes L1-L3
- LGV is a systemic disease with an aggressive nature and initially presents as a painless genital papule or ulcer leading to excessive regional lymphadenopathy, sometimes even resulting in lymphedema or elephantiasis
- Diagnosis is best done by PCR
- Doxycycline is the treatment of choice, and is highly e%ective when given early in the course of the disease

INTRODUCTION
Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), along with gonorrhea, syphilis, chancroid and donovanosis, is one of the five classic venereal diseases. There is considerable confusion about terminology, especially between the latter and LGV (Table 49-1).

============================================================
CHUNK 5
============================================================
GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION
LGV has a worldwide distribution but is more prevalent in tropical and subtropical areas. LGV is sporadic in North America and Europe, where recent outbreaks have been reported among men who have sex with  men  [1,  2].  LGV  remains  endemic  in  parts  of  Africa,  India, Southeast Asia, the Caribbean and Brazil. Prevalence depends on the quality of diagnostic facilities and the training of health personnel.

============================================================

============================================================
TRANSMISSION
LGV  is  a  sexually  transmitted  infection  (STI).  Major  sources  are asymptomatic  carriers,  especially  women  with  LGV  endocervicitis. The frequency of infection following exposure seems to be relatively low,  although  the  actual  risk  of  infection  is  unknown.  Extragenital transmission,  mostly  in  laboratory  infections,  occasionally  occurs. Autoinfection (conjunctivitis) is possible.
LGV is six times more frequently observed in men. However, delayed complications,  such  as  lymphedema  or  rectal  strictures,  are  more commonly reported among women.

ETIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY
A  relationship  between  inguinal  bubos  and  granulomas  was  first observed  in  the  18th  century.  The  first  description  of  LGV  was  by Wallace in 1833. With the introduction of the first serologic tests for venereal diseases by Wassermann in 1906, separation of syphilis from

Infectious agent, Donovanosis = Calymmatobacterium granulomatis. Infectious agent, Lymphogranuloma venereum = Chlamydia trachomatis L1, L2, L3. Synonyms, Donovanosis = Granuloma inguinale Granuloma venereum. Synonyms, Lymphogranuloma venereum = Lymphopathia venereum Lymphogranuloma inguinale Tropical bubo, climatic bubo Durand-Nicolas-Favré disease

============================================================
SECONDARY LYMPHOGRANULOMA VENEREUM (LGV)
From the site of the primary lesion, the infection reaches the neighboring lymph nodes, resulting in an extensive inflammation of the regional lymphatic tissue. This feature is often the first noted presentation of the disease and seen at a time when the primary lesion has already healed.

============================================================
CHUNK 9
============================================================
Inguinal Syndrome
Most  commonly,  patients  present  with  an  'inguinal  syndrome',  a painful inguinal lymphadenopathy that usually develops 2-6 weeks after  the  initial  infection.  The  inflammation  starts  unilaterally  but tends to spread to the other side in about a third of cases. Progressive periadenitis  involves  the  overlying  skin.  Small  abscesses  coalesce, forming bubos that may rupture spontaneously. Multiple fistulae and sinuses break open and discharge purulent fluid. The enlargement of lymph  nodes  above  and  below  the  inguinal  ligament  results  in  a characteristic 'groove sign' (Fig. 49.1).
After several  months, spontaneous healing occurs leaving extensive scars and masses of fibrotic granulomatous tissue. Relapse occurs in about 20% of untreated cases.
Constitutional symptoms are common during the secondary stage of LGV,  indicating  dissemination  of  the  infection.  Fever,  malaise  and myalgia  are  reported  by  most  patients.  Meningism,  arthralgia  and other  extra-genital manifestations are less frequent.  Severe systemic infection  following  hematogenous  spread  is  usually  a  feature  of severely immunosuppressed patients.

============================================================
Anorectal Syndrome
An LGV-associated anorectal syndrome is most commonly reported in men who have anally receptive sex with men. Patients present with a  hemorrhagic  proctitis  or  proctocolitis  resembling  histologically chronic  ulcerative  bowel  disease.  Extensive  lymphadenopathy  may develop in the pelvic, obturator or iliac area, leading to complaints of lower abdominal or back pains. When left untreated, the condition may result in rectal fistulae, perirectal abscess formation, adhesion of the rectum to the pelvic wall and rectal strictures, usually with a long and tubular appearance.

============================================================
CHUNK 11
============================================================
TERTIARY LYMPHOGRANULOMA VENEREUM (LGV)
Late  complications  of  untreated  LGV  may  appear  months  or  years after  the  initial  infection  in  about  25%  of  inappropriately  treated patients. Obstruction of lymphatic vessels results in lymphedema and elephantiasis of the external genitalia and sometimes the lower limbs. Patients  with  these presentations  are  rare  except  in  areas with very limited health facilities.

CHUNK 12
============================================================
MICROSCOPIC DIAGNOSIS
LGV cannot be diagnosed exclusively on clinical grounds; specialized laboratory  examinations  are  required.  Smears,  scrapings,  aspirated material or biopsies can be Giemsa-stained and examined for inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm of macrophages or stellate abscesses in tissue  sections.  Microscopic  examination  has  a  low  sensitivity  and specificity  that  can  be  enhanced  by  using  fluorescein-conjugated monoclonal antibodies and immunofluorescence.

============================================================
CHUNK 13
============================================================
MOLECULAR DIAGNOSIS
Isolation and strain differentiation in cell culture is an expensive and technically demanding method that was formerly the gold standard for the diagnosis of LGV. This method has now been largely replaced by nucleic acid amplification techniques (NAAT) that enable direct pathogen detection in smears and affected tissues. The diagnosis of a C.  trachomatis infection  can  be  established  by  sequencing  the outer membrane  protein  A ( ompA )  gene.  However,  NAAT  have  not  been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the diagnosis of rectal chlamydial infection.

============================================================
CHUNK 14
============================================================
ANTIBODY DETECTION TESTS
Antibody  detection  tests  are  of  limited  value  for  diagnosing  LGV. Normally, a fourfold or greater increase in a specific titer is considered to  be  diagnostic.  Several  test  assays  are  available  based  on  ELISA, complement fixation or indirect immunofluorescence techniques.
The intradermal skin test (Frei test) is historical and no longer in use.

============================================================
CHUNK 15
============================================================
ANTIBIOTIC TREATMENT
Antibiotics  can  stop  progressive  inflammation,  but  cannot  prevent tissue  destruction  and  scarring.  The treatment  of  choice  for  LGV  is doxycycline  100 mg  b.i.d.  for  21  days.  Alternatively,  tetracycline 500 mg  q.i.d.  can  be  used.  Resistance  to  these  antibiotics  is  not known. Treatment failure  is  usually  a  result  of  misdiagnosis,  poor compliance or re-infection.
Should tetracyclines be contraindicated, erythromycin (500 mg q.i.d. for 21 days), azithromycin (1 g daily for 21 days), rifampicin or chloramphenicol can be used. Comparative studies have not been done. The  activity  of  fluoroquinolones  is  uncertain.  Penicillins,  cephalosporines and aminoglycosides are not effective [4].

============================================================
CHUNK 16
============================================================
SURGICAL TREATMENT
Pus from bubos should be aspirated and drained and fistulas should receive clean dressings. The severe deformities of tertiary LGV can only be treated with plastic surgery, which should only be performed after a  prolonged  course  of  antibiotics.  Patients  with  extensive  scarring should be monitored at least annually and, if necessary, suspicious lesions should be biopsied to assess for presence of malignancy.
