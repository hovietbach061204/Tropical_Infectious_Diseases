INTRODUCTION
Pneumonia is a syndrome of inflammation, congestion and compromise  of  gas  exchange  in  the  lungs  that  disproportionately  affects children, but affects all ages, and can lead to severe illness, hospitalization and death [1]. It is usually caused by infection, although it may be  caused  by  non-infectious  exposures  and  aspiration.  Bacteria  are among the leading infectious causes of pneumonia, with many being vaccine-preventable.  Pneumonia  is  currently  the  leading  cause  of child  death  worldwide  [2],  excluding  neonatal  deaths,  with  most deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries (see Fig. 38.1). Although pneumonia was once the leading cause of child death in children in high income countries [1], the introduction of vaccines and  improvements  in  overall  living  standards  have  substantially reduced infection and mortality rates. Similar reductions are possible in the developing world, although important knowledge gaps remain for optimal disease control.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
A  review  of  28  longitudinal,  community-based  studies  conducted between 1969 and 1999 estimated the median incidence of clinical pneumonia in the developing world to be 0.28 episodes per childyear  (interquartile  range  of  0.21-0.7 1 episodes/child-year)  [3].  This translates into 151.8 million cases of pneumonia per year from developing countries alone, of which, 13.1 million (8.7%) are of hospitalizable severity. An additional 4 million cases are estimated to arise in wealthier countries, for a total global burden of 156 million pneumonia cases per year. Over 97% of incident pneumonia cases among children occur among tropical and subtropical developing countries, and over 50% occur in India, China, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia and  Nigeria.  Across  the  six  World  Health  Organization  (WHO) regions  (see  Fig.  38.2),  the  average  pneumonia  incidence  rates  (in episodes/child-year) are: Southeast Asia (0.36), Africa (0.33), Eastern Mediterranean (0.28), Western Pacific (0.22), the Americas (0.10) and the European Regions (0.06). In terms of pneumonia mortality, over 70% of deaths from clinical pneumonia occur in developing countries, primarily in the tropical/subtropical belt [3], with two-thirds of pneumonia deaths occurring in 10 countries. Pneumonia mortality has been associated with a number of risk factors, but the strongest include malnutrition, low birth weight, absence of breastfeeding, lack of measles vaccination, indoor air pollution and over-crowding [1, 3].

THE BACTERIAL ETIOLOGY OF PNEUMONIA
There  are  several  bacterial  agents  associated  with  pneumonia.  The evidence for these has been reported by two classes of studies, each with  important  limitations.  One  type  of  study  is  the  prospective observational study (in some cases, simply surveillance). These have been  primarily  hospital-based  and  have  primarily  relied  on  blood cultures for etiologic detection. One limitation is that blood culture is  insensitive. Typically, microbiologic analysis of blood is less than 15% sensitive for establishing a  causative  agent during pneumonia [1];  this  sensitivity  falls  further  by  pre-culture  antibiotic  exposure. Moreover, some pathogens are fastidious and do not grow well in standard media. Lung aspirates, though somewhat more sensitive, are considered too invasive for most investigations. Sputum is difficult to obtain  from  young  children  and  its  interpretation  is  controversial, while nasopharyngeal swabs and aspirates may demonstrate carriage, which  is  common  in  young  children  in  developing  countries,  but does not necessarily confirm invasive disease. Thus, nearly all bacterial pneumonia  pathogens  are  substantially  under-estimated.  Another limitation is that, as most of these studies were of hospitalized children, they were at the more severe spectrum of illness and may not be representative of most incident pneumonia cases. The second type of study is vaccine trials - often referred to as probe studies - where the attributable burden from a particular pathogen is estimated from the proportion of pneumonia prevented by a vaccine specific for that organism. An important caveat is that bacterial and viral pathogens have both been shown to interact [4], and pneumococcal vaccine, in particular, has been shown to reduce influenza-positive pneumonia [5], thus, not all pneumonia prevented by a vaccine may be caused by the specific pathogen targeted by the vaccine.
Nonetheless,  both  types  of  studies  appear  to  support Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus)  as  being  the  main  bacterial  cause  of childhood pneumonia (30-50%), with Haemophilus influenzae being the second most common (10-30%) [3]. These two agents account for approximately 50% of cases of children hospitalized with pneumonia  in  developing  countries  [1].  Other  bacteria  that  have  been reported  in  young  children  include Staphylococcus  aureus , Klebsiella pneumoniae and non-typable H. influenzae (Papua New Guinea and The  Gambia).  Of  note,  although  non-typhoidal Salmonella spp.

(sub-Saharan Africa), and Salmonella Typhi (South Asia) have been isolated from the blood of children with pneumonia in Africa and Asia,  this  may  represent  co-infection,  rather  than  imply  causation. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia spp. have  also  been  reported  as  causes  of  acute  childhood  pneumonia; however, there is little consensus regarding their relative importance to acute childhood pneumonia [3]. Viral etiologies are also common causes of acute childhood pneumonia and include influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, metapneumonia virus, adenoviruses and others (discussed elsewhere), and bacterial suprainfection of lung tissue following viral infection is common, with S. pneumoniae , S. aureus , Streptococcus spp., and H. influenzae being the most commonly associated supra-infecting agents. The causes of acute bacterial pneumonia in children infected with HIV mirror those seen in HIV non-infected children, with S.  pneumoniae and H. influenzae being the most commonly reported. Children co-infected with HIV are more likely to develop acute bacterial pneumonia than HIV noninfected children.

NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS AND PATHOLOGY
Pathogen invasion and entry into the respiratory tract is poorly understood,  although  animal  studies  suggest  that,  at  least  in  the  case  of pneumococcus, it is receptor mediated [6]. The syndrome of pneumonia, however, is one in which the alveoli and interstitium become inflamed, and fluid and cells fill the alveolar air sacs. Because liquids have surface tension, the fluid in the alveolar sacs draws the walls of the alveoli together, collapsing the alveoli. During inspiration, these alveolar  air  sacs  are  forcibly  re-opened  against this  surface  tension, giving rise to the crackling sound heard during inspiration by auscultation with a stethoscope. In turn, this surface tension creates lower airway obstruction. Normally, the alveolar air sac is only one cell layer thick, allowing for easy gas exchange. Transudate fluid and debris in the alveolar air sac compromises oxygenation (air entry into the lung) and respiration (gas exchange or the transfer of CO2 in exchange for oxygen). The body's initial compensatory reaction is increased respiratory rate (tachypnea). This is, perhaps, the most sensitive indicator of  lower  airway  obstruction  [7].  As  more  alveoli  become  fluid filled, lower air obstruction becomes more severe and effort shifts to keeping the alveoli open. This is appreciated clinically by the use of accessory  muscles  -  initially  the  intercostal  muscles  (intercostal retractions) - and, as obstruction progresses, the diaphragm contracts with  greater  force  to  overcome  inertia,  producing  lower  chest  wall in-drawing  (primarily  noted  in  children  less  than  three  years  old whose chest walls are relatively soft because of a greater cartilage/bone ratio). Other compensatory mechanisms at this stage include grunting, which is a sound produced by exhaling against a partially closed glottis or 'laryngeal braking' [8]. This maintains positive pressure in the airway by retaining inspired air in the alveolar sac longer in order to prevent alveolar collapse [9]. This increases lung volume and functional  residual  capacity,  the  effect  of  which  is  to  increase  alveolar ventilation  (the  amount  of  air  that  reaches  the  alveoli  such

CHUNK 6
============================================================
NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS AND PATHOLOGY
that oxygen can be exchanged for CO2 per unit time), which results in a measurable increase in arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) and a decrease in  arterial  carbon  dioxide  (PaCO 2 ).  The  respiratory  muscles  in  a young child, particularly the diaphragm, have little  reserve  and are prone to fatigue and respiratory failure. Laryngeal braking (grunting) decreases diaphragmatic work by keeping more alveoli open at the end of expiration and improving gas exchange. Additional accessory muscles  of  the  upper  and  lower  thorax  may  be  recruited  in  more advanced stages of lower airway obstruction, resulting in the clinical signs of 'head-bobbing' and chest-abdomen 'see-sawing'. Clinically, these changes are seen as 'respiratory distress'. Maladaptive compensatory responses to obstruction include cessation of feeding, resulting in the WHO danger sign of 'inability to feed or drink' [10]. As the child is  fighting  to  prevent alveolar collapse and  maintain  positive pressure at the end of the respiratory cycle, as well as maximize alveolar ventilation, it opts against breath holding, which is necessary for swallowing during feeding. The effect is to deprive the child's respiratory muscles of needed fuel, which will hasten respiratory fatigue and failure, and is thus a danger sign. As lower airway obstruction continues without intervention, diaphragmatic and accessory muscle fatigue set in and respiratory rate and effort fall. This can be misinterpreted as evidence that lower airway obstruction is not severe, rather than as decompensation and impending respiratory failure. As PaCO2 rises, the child may become initially agitated; as it rises further, the child may  convulse.  As  PaO2  falls  and  the  child's  brain  is  progressively deprived of oxygen, the child may, at first, become less active, then lethargic  or  obtunded.  These  are  terminal  phases  before  complete respiratory failure and death.

CLINICAL FEATURES
The clinical features of pneumonia follow from the underlying pathophysiology of infection followed by inflammation and congestion in the lower airway. There is a range of symptoms that may vary somewhat with age [7]. The most consistent feature is tachypnea, or rapid breathing,  the  underlying  pathophysiology  of  which  is  described above. This is  age-dependent  and  the  WHO  have  established age-specific cut-offs as follows (breaths/minute): age < 2 months ≥ 60/ minute; age 2-1 1 months ≥ 50/min; children 12-59 months ≥ 40/min [10]. In addition to tachypnea, a history and presentation of cough is nearly  universal.  These two signs,  fast  breathing and  cough should place pneumonia at the top of a differential diagnosis until proven otherwise  by  systematic  exclusion.  Other  clinical  features  are  discussed below in patient evaluation.

============================================================
CHUNK 8
============================================================
CLINICAL EXAMINATION FINDINGS
A thorough history should precede the examination, with emphasis on the initial symptom onset, progression of other symptoms and their duration prior to seeking medical care. During the history, the clinician should observe the patient, specifically looking for rate and effort of breathing, cyanosis, level of alertness and responsiveness to the caretaker. These should be evaluated in the context of the patient's age  (the  younger  the  patient  is,  the  more  vulnerable  they  are  to respiratory  failure)  and  nutritional  status  (if  severe  malnutrition  is present, hospitalize - even if pneumonia signs are not severe). The interview should solicit any history of convulsions, feeding behavior, and responsiveness to the caregiver.
A systematic clinical examination is necessary, with emphasis on key organ systems that may be compromised by the underlying pathophysiology.  These  include:  (i)  the  respiratory  tract,  with  emphasis on the effort of breathing, the quality of breath sounds and investigation  for  hypoxia;  (ii)  neurologic  status,  with  emphasis  on  level  of alertness and responsiveness to external stimuli; and (iii) supportive findings suggestive of severe bacterial infection, including temperature, perfusion, the presence of skin lesions and an ability to drink or feed.

============================================================
CHUNK 9
============================================================
CLINICAL EXAMINATION FINDINGS
Pneumonia is graded according to three levels of severity: non-severe, severe and very severe (Table 38-1 - online only). It is important to note that even non-severe pneumonia is a severe illness, as anything that  compromises  breathing  in  a  small  child  is  potentially  lifethreatening and should prompt intervention. Non-severe pneumonia is characterized  by  age-specific  tachypnea  and  history  of  cough.  The child may be irritable or less active than normal, but should otherwise be  alert  and  responsive.  On  auscultation,  crepitations  (short,  fine crackles on inspiration) or reduced breath sounds should be appreciated.  This  requires  that  the  health  provider  time  the  breath  sound with the breathing cycle in order to minimize confusion with other adventitious  breath  sounds,  such  as  wheezing  (long,  high-pitched whistling sounds primarily on expiration that originate in the bronchioles). Chest-wall percussion  is less diagnostic in young children than in adults. Severe pneumonia is characterized by tachypnea, with cough  and  at  least  one  of  the  following  signs:  lower  chest  wall in-drawing  (not  to  be  confused  with  intercostal  retractions),  nasal flaring or grunting (primarily in young infants < 24 months old). Of these,  lower  chest  wall  in-drawing  is  the  most  obvious.  This  is  the collapse of the lower chest wall during inspiration and is caused by a sharp decrease in intrathoracic pressure as the child forcibly contracts the diaphragm to overcome lower airway obstruction. The external atmospheric pressure subsequently collapses the chest wall, much like the effect on a paper straw when one forcibly sucks against resistance. The chest wall of a young child, particularly less than three years old, is composed of more cartilage than that of an older child and is thus softer and more collapsible. Chest wall in-drawing may not be consistently  appreciated  in children older  than three  years  of age  [1 1]. Very severe pneumonia is characterized by tachypnea and cough plus at least one of the classic WHO danger signs: central cyanosis; inability to drink or feed (or vomiting anything ingested); lethargy or obtundation; convulsions; and other signs of severe respiratory distress such as head nodding and chest-abdominal see-sawing. As noted above, tachypnea may not be present in the later stages of very severe pneumonia  as  the  patient  begins  to  decompensate;  however,  the

SUPPORTIVE CLINICAL FINDINGS
Hypoxia is an under-appreciated feature of pneumonia with prognostic  significance.  Up  to  59%  of  children  admitted  to  hospital  with pneumonia  have  oxygen  saturation < 90%  (moderate  hypoxia)  or even less (severe hypoxia; SPO2 at elevation can be lower than 50%) [1]. The risk of mortality is substantially increased (by up to four times in certain settings) among hypoxic children. Clinical signs for identifying hypoxia have proven less reliable than pulse oxymetry. The use of pulse oxymetry has been shown to reduce mortality by up to 35% compared  with  clinical  criteria  [1].  Continuous  oxygen  therapy  by nasal prongs or nasal cannula is recommended for all children with moderate or greater hypoxia, as well as those with cyanosis, inability to drink or feed, or a respiratory rate > 60/minute.

============================================================
CHUNK 16
============================================================
LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS
Blood cultures are insensitive at establishing an etiologic agent [1]. Nasopharyngeal swabs are indicative of carriage, but do not establish invasiveness. A number of rapid antigen assays to detect respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal washes or swabs are available in industrialized countries, but these are not readily available in resource-limited settings. Outside of intensive care settings, lung aspirates are considered too invasive as a general diagnostic approach. As such, there is currently no gold standard for etiologic diagnosis of acute pneumonia,  although  a  positive  blood  culture  with  a  potentially  causative agent  is,  in  most  cases,  considered  conclusive  of  invasive  disease. Newer  technologies  to  identify  invasive  pathogens  include  assays resting on antigen detection and/or amplification, but none of these have, as yet, become a standard.

CHEST ROENTGENOGRAMS (CHEST X-RAYS)
Abnormal chest roentgenograms (CXRs) show reasonable sensitivity but  poor  specificity  for  bacterial  pneumonia  [12];  however,  many children  with  pneumonia  initially  have  normal  chest  radiographs. One reason is that CXR findings can lag behind clinical presentation [13], and CXRs are often not repeated. Current emphasis is on empirical therapy, rather than radiographic diagnosis [7].

MISCELLANEOUS CLINICAL FINDINGS
Staphylococcal  pneumonia  may  be  associated  with  rapid  illness progression  in  the  presence  of  treatment,  and  can  result  in  lung cavitation,  pneumatocele, pneumothorax,  pleural  effusions  and empyema.
Tuberculosis is often a diagnosis of exclusion in the absence of available laboratory support. If children have fever for > 14 days and clinical  pneumonia,  health  providers  should  consider  tuberculosis.  If other  causes  of  fever  cannot  be  identified,  then  anti-tuberculosis therapy should also be considered based on national epidemiology and guidelines.
Pneumocystis (carinii) jiroveci infection should be considered in HIVinfected children, especially in the setting of hypoxia, respiratory distress  and  interstitial  infiltrates  on  CXR.  Therapy  should be  tailored accordingly.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The signs and symptoms of clinical pneumonia are designed to be maximally  sensitive  (include  the  largest  possible  fraction  of  true pneumonia-positive cases), while sacrificing specificity (inclusion of false-positives  -  children  without  pneumonia)  in  order  to  ensure that the largest possible fraction of true pneumonia patients receive antimicrobial treatment.  Although  there  are  regional differences  in the  prevalence  of  other  diagnoses  and  comorbidities,  some  of  the more important syndromes to consider include the following, listed below.

============================================================
CHUNK 20
============================================================
Reactive Airways Disease (RAD or Asthma)
This is reversible lower airway obstruction, associated with history of cough (particularly at night), with or without wheezing on auscultation (long, musical, high-pitched whistling sound on expiration originating in the bronchioles) and can be differentiated from crepitations (short crackling sounds on inspiration associated with pneumonia) in the alveoli by both the quality of the sound and particularly by the timing in the respiratory cycle. RAD may follow, or accompany, a viral infection, but often persists after the viral infection has resolved, and may be triggered by other causes (e.g. indoor air pollution). Fever is often not present. Cough, particularly night-time coughing may be the primary sign. This may be diagnosed by a beta-agonist challenge, such as with an albuterol nebulizer and is appreciated by a decrease in respiratory rate (by ≥ 5 breaths/minute) and effort, and improved oxygen saturation.

============================================================
CHUNK 21
============================================================
Bronchiolitis
This is usually, but not always, viral in origin and is commonly caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), but is associated with many respiratory viruses. It is characterized by cough and wheezing on expiration,  along  with  signs  of  viral  infection  -  notably  fever  and  often rhinorrhea. Children tend to be < 2 years of age and may present with wheezing for the first time. Children may or may not respond to betaagonist challenge, but young age and febrile wheezing are strongly suggestive.

CHUNK 22
============================================================
Tuberculosis
Tuberculosis has been discussed above, but should also be considered in children who have been successfully treated for pneumonia who then  return  with  subsequent  pneumonia  re-diagnoses.  These  may occur within days or weeks of prior successful treatment. Tuberculosis should  also  be  considered  in  children  who  do  not  respond  completely to conventional antibiotic therapy and/or have weight loss or failure-to-thrive (failure to appropriately gain weight), and/or have a known  exposure  or  other  suggestive  history.  Sputum  for  acid  fast bacilli (AFB) is difficult to obtain in children, but gastric lavage, tuberculous skin testing (e.g. Mantoux) and CXR may all be considered.

Malaria
Malaria has been shown to present with many of the same signs and symptoms as severe pneumonia in high malaria endemic areas. Pallor (signs of anemia) and hemorrhagic skin lesions favor malaria [10]. Blood smears will identify malaria parasites, but may not always be diagnostic. Intervention in these cases should follow local or national guidelines.

Foreign Body Aspiration
This  can  mimic  infectious  pneumonia  and  can  be  identified  by patient history if  ingestion was observed or suspected by a missing object.

TREATMENT
Early  intervention  with  appropriate  antibiotics  is  associated  with  a 36%  reduction  in  pneumonia  mortality  [14].  Although  there  are general guidelines for treatment [7, 10], these should be tailored to local data on antimicrobial resistance. Table 38-2 includes recent supportive evidence, ranked by strength of study design, for current standard guidelines. The treatment regimens follow general principles of oral therapy for non-severe and even severe pneumonia in some cases, and parenteral antimicrobials for severe and very severe pneumonia, with  two  important  caveats.  Children  with  non-severe  pneumonia who are less than 2 months old [7] and those who are severely malnourished [10] should be referred to hospital because of their high risk of progressing to severe illness. Coverage for pneumonia should at least target S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae . The current guidance for first-line therapy for outpatient, non-severe, childhood pneumonia is to use standard dose amoxicillin (45 mg/kg divided into two daily doses) for 3-5 days. Evidence suggests that high-dose oral amoxicillin  should  be  effective  against  pneumococci  with  a  minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ≤ 4 μ g/ml [15]. Current evidence also suggests that a three-day regimen of double-dose amoxicillin may be  as  effective  as  a  five-day  regimen  of  standard  dose  amoxicillin for  pediatric  community-acquired  pneumonia  [16].  Cotrimoxazole (20 mg/kg  sulfamethoxazole  divided  into  two  daily  doses  for  five days) may be used as an alternative agent. If a child fails to improve by  48-72 hours,  then  change  to high-dose  amoxicillin/clavulanate (90 mg/kg ÷ BID) for up to seven days or a macrolide such as azithromycin [17]. Additionally, the cause for treatment failure should be systematically determined.

============================================================
CHUNK 35
============================================================
TREATMENT
The current practice for very severe pneumonia remains hospital treatment with either ampicillin with or without gentamicin or a thirdgeneration  cephalosporin  (e.g.  ceftriaxone  IV  at  50 mg/kg/day). Chloramphenicol resistance  remains high and  its clinical  performance in multicenter evaluation has been inferior [18]. The optimal treatment of children with severe pneumonia is less established. Historically,  international  guidance  was  that  children < 5  years  old  with severe pneumonia should be hospitalized for parenteral therapy [10]; however,  recent  evidence  suggests  that  children  treated  for  severe pneumonia on an outpatient basis with double-dose amoxicillin for five  days  recovered as  well  as  hospitalized  children  treated  for  two days with ampicillin followed by three days with high-dose amoxicillin  [19].  Combination  benzyl  penicillin  and  gentamicin  and  chloramphenicol  have  shown  equivalent  efficacy  in  the  treatment  of severe pneumonia [20].
For outpatient non-severe pneumonia ,  enhanced amoxicillin/clavulanate twice  daily  is  effective  in  treating  penicillin-resistant S.  pneumoniae [21] and parenteral benzyl penicillin remains the drug of choice for treatment of S. pneumoniae where the penicillin MIC is ≤ 2 μ g/ml [22]. Limited data indicate that both severe and very severe pneumonia can be managed on an outpatient basis in a daycare clinical facility [23]; however, further studies on the management of severe pneumonia are needed to determine optimal treatment guidelines.
If staphylococcal pneumonia is suspected, which is suggested by rapid clinical  deterioration  in  the  presence  of  standard  antimicrobial therapy, by CXR findings of a pneumatocele or pneumothorax with pleural  effusion,  by  skin  pustules,  soft  tissue  infection,  or  heavy growth of S. aureus in sputum, blood or empyema cultures, a regimen of  cloxacillin  (50 mg/kg  IM or IV  every  six  hours)  and gentamicin (7.5 mg/kg IM or IV once daily) is recommended [10].

============================================================
CHUNK 36
============================================================
TREATMENT
In  addition  to  antimicrobial  coverage,  patients  with  moderate  or severe hypoxia ( ≤ 90% SPO2 on room air) should be provided continuous supplemental oxygen [24]. Flow rates are limited to ≤ 2 L/min by nasal prongs. If greater oxygenation is required, continuous positive air pressure (CPAP) or intubation in very severe cases should be considered, if feasible.
Another important support for improving pneumonia case management is breastfeeding, which has been shown to have a strong effect on both pneumonia prevention and case-management, and should be encouraged as part of all management regimens for children up to 12 months of age [10].
Other  supplemental  support  includes  beta-agonist  inhaler  use  for children who are wheezing and antipyretics for fever. Adequate hydration support is also important, as both tachypnea and fever increase insensible  water  loss  [10].  This  raises  the  possibility  of  using  oral rehydration solution as a hydration choice both because many children with pneumonia have diarrhea and also because of its ease of absorption; however, there is currently no evidence that oral rehydration solution versus other liquids is superior in treating children with pneumonia.

============================================================
CHUNK 37
============================================================
GOOD CLINICAL PRACTICE
Once the patient  has  begun treatment and is  stabilized,  it is  good clinical practice to review with the parent the signs and symptoms of pneumonia and the indications for future clinical referral by illustrating  these  in  the  child.  Many  parents  in  high  pneumonia  endemic areas are poor at recognizing these signs, despite the high incidence of pneumonia [7] - presentation to a clinic may provide a 'teachable moment'. All patients  managed  on  an  outpatient  basis  should  be advised to return to the clinic if they fail to improve by 72 hours, or worsen at any time. The physician should follow-up all outpatients at least once to assess their status [25].

============================================================
CHUNK 38
============================================================
PREVENTION AND CONTROL
Immunization  with H.  influenzae B  (Hib)  and  protein-conjugate pneumococcal  vaccines  may  be  able  to  prevent  up  to  50%  of  all pneumonia-related child mortality [26]. Currently, the Hib vaccine is used in over 100 countries and 61 out of 72 (85%) countries eligible for Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations (GAVI) funding have agreed to introduce the Hib vaccine [27]. As of January 2009, 42  GAVI-eligible  countries  (58%)  expressed  interest  in  introducing pneumococcal vaccine [28]. Current recommendations include Hib, pneumococcal protein-conjugates, measles, and pertussis vaccines to decrease the global burden of pneumonia [7]. In addition to these vaccines, other interventions for which there is strong preventive evidence include zinc and hand-washing [1, 7]. Exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life reduces pneumonia mortality fivefold, while  continuation  of  breastfeeding  for  infants  aged  6-1 1  months further reduces pneumonia mortality and should be encouraged [7]. Finally,  as  malnutrition  is  estimated  to  contribute  an  additional  1 million child deaths per year and complicates over 50% of all lessthan-five-year-old mortality [2], long-term solutions and programs to reduce  pneumonia  mortality  should  include  ensuring  adequate nutrition.
