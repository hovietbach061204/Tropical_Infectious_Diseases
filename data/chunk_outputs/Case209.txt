Key features
- Angiostrongylus is the most common parasitic cause of eosinophilic meningitis
- The most common mode of transmission is raw snail consumption. Many patients have been infected by eating uncooked paratenic hosts, such as freshwater prawns, crabs, frogs and monitor lizards. Contaminated vegetables and fruits may also transmit the infection
- Ocular involvement occurs in about 1% of patients
- Pathologic changes include in%ltration of lymphocytes, eosinophils and plasma cells in meninges. Granuloma formation may be found surrounding dead parasites
- Treatment is often symptomatic. Corticosteroids can improve symptoms. Albendazole and mebendazole with or without corticosteroids have limited clinical experience

INTRODUCTION
The  first  discovery  of  the  worm, Angiostrongylus  cantonensis in  the pulmonary arteries and hearts of domestic rats in Canton, China was reported by Chen in 1935. However, the first case of human infection was  documented  in  1945  in  Taiwan.  Since  then,  there  have  been reports  of  outbreaks  or  sporadic  infection  of  this  parasite  in  many parts of the world. It is estimated that 150 million people are at risk.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Nearly 3000 cases of Angiostrongylus  cantonensis have  been  reported worldwide since 1945 [1]. However, these figures only include reports from publications in international journals; the incidence of angiostrogyliasis meningitis is likely under-reported. Endemic areas are in Asia, the Pacific Islands and Australia. Outbreaks of sporadic cases of eosinophilic  meningitis  have  been  reported  in  travelers  returning from  endemic  areas.  In  Thailand,  where  most  cases  have  been reported,  the  estimated  incidence  has  ranged  from  0.19-2.25  per 100,000 population during the years 1996-2000. The majority of the cases are young adults, but children are also affected. In most reports, males are affected more frequently than females.

NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS AND PATHOLOGY
Humans  become  infected  after  ingestion  of  third-stage  larvae  of A. cantonensis when eating undercooked intermediate hosts, such as snails or slugs. Many paratenic hosts have been implicated as sources

of  infection,  including  prawns,  crabs,  frogs  and  monitor  lizards. Unclean vegetables, fruits and drinking water are occasionally sources of infection. After ingestion, larvae are released in the intestine and invade  the  intestinal  wall  entering  into  the  circulation,  passing through  liver,  heart,  lungs  and,  finally,  moving  to  the  brain.  In humans, the  larvae  will  molt  into  fourth-stage  larvae  but  will  not develop further and usually die in the brain after 1-2 months. Occasionally, larvae may invade the orbits causing ocular disease. Pathologic changes involve an inflammatory response to the presence or movement  of  larvae  in  the  brain.  Lymphocytes,  plasma  cells  and eosinophils  infiltrate  the  meninges  or  around  the  cerebral  vessels, forming a granuloma around the dead parasites. Migration of worms makes parasitic tracks with hemorrhage and microcavities. Hemosiderin, eosinophils, glial scars and Charcot-Leyden crystals can be seen in the track. Living worms have been detected in pulmonary vessels of  patients  from  Taiwan,  Australia,  Jamaica  and  Thailand  during necropsy [2-5].

============================================================
CLINICAL FEATURES
Clinical  manifestations  are  associated  with  worm  migration  and inflammatory response to the worm. Disease severity and incubation period depend on the number of larva ingested. The disease is generally benign and self-limiting with some patients only experiencing a mild headache that spontaneously subsides, but, occasionally, there is severe illness with long-lasting neurologic sequelae. The incubation period ranges from one day to many weeks. Some patients develop gastrointestinal symptoms when the ingested larvae are released and invade the intestinal wall causing abdominal discomfort, nausea and vomiting.  For  patients  with  neurologic  involvement,  most  patients develop signs and symptoms of meningitis, but occasionally develop encephalitis. The most common signs and symptoms of patients with eosinophilic meningitis or meningoencephalitis are headache, nausea, vomiting, fever, blurred vision, diplopia, paraesthesia, urinary retention, altered consciousness or coma, and focal neurologic deficit [6, 7] (Fig. 1 18.1). Headache is usually gradual. Fever is low grade; however, high grade fever is more common in children. Neck stiffness, positive Brudzinsky  or  Kernig's  sign,  papilloedema,  cranial  nerve  palsy  and sensory impairment may be detected. Patients usually recover spontaneously within a few weeks. Drug treatment can shorten the duration of headache and reduce the number of lumbar punctures required. Case mortality rate is very low; death is more common in children.

CLINICAL FEATURES
About 1% of angiostrongyliasis patients have ocular involvement [8]. Many of these cases have been reported from Thailand, Indonesia, Japan, Taiwan, India, Sri Lanka and Australia [8-15]. Ocular angiostrongyliasis  is  usually  found  in  association  with  meningitis.  The parasite  can  be  seen  in  the  anterior  or  posterior  chamber  without causing  inflammation.  In  such  cases,  patients  usually  complain  of seeing  something  moving  in  the  eye  without  visual  loss.  Cases  in which the larval migration causes an inflammatory or granulomatous reaction in the retina, vitreous or anterior or posterior chamber may present  with  loss  of  vision,  eye  pain  and  redness  (Figs  1 18.2  and 118.3).  Signs  of  iritis,  vitreous  haziness,  ophthalmitis  or  retinal detachment can be detected. Patients who present with visual impairment may not regain normal visual acuity after recovery.

PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
In the appropriate epidemiologic setting, patients who present with symptoms  and  signs  of  meningitis  should  be  evaluated  for Angiostrongylus .  Severe  cases  present  with  meningoencephalitis  or  have cranial nerve involvement; presentation in children tends to be more severe than in adults. Careful examination of the eyes should be done. Laboratory criteria for diagnosis of eosinophilic meningitis include cerebrospinal  fluid  (CSF)  eosinophils  of  more  than  10  cells/ml  or 10%  of  CSF  white  blood  cells  (WBC).  Angiostrongyliasis  patients usually have a high CSF pressure above 200 mmH2O, and the CSF usually contains between 500 and 2000 leukocytes/mm 3 with more than  20%  eosinophils,  normal  glucose  and  slightly  raised  protein. Complete  blood  examination  reveals  eosinophilia  in  the  majority of cases.
Patients with focal neurodeficit or encephalitis should receive a computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to exclude other conditions. MRI findings of Angiostrongylus meningitis  can  be  normal  or  show  meningeal  enhancement  without  focal lesion or abnormal micronodular enhanced lesions [16]. Small parasitic  tracks  may  be  detected  by  MRI.  Brain  edema  may  be  seen  in severe cases.
The  definitive  diagnosis  of Angiostrongylus meningitis  is  based  on detection of the parasite in the CSF sample or in the eye. When no parasite is obtained, serologic diagnosis can be performed by detection of Angiostrongylus antibodies or antigen in serum or CSF by ELISA or immunoblot technique.

============================================================
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Eosinophilic meningitis can be caused by other parasitic infections, such as gnathostomiasis, paragonimiasis, cysticercosis, schistosomiasis, toxocariasis, baylisascariasis or trichinellosis (Fig. 1 18.4). In Thailand,  gnathostomiasis  is  an  important  differential  and  should  be suspected if the patient has a previous history of migratory swellings and they have hemorrhagic or xanthochromic spinal fluid and eosinophilic pleocytosis. Serologic diagnosis can be performed to differentiate these two infections.

TREATMENT
Most patients spontaneously recover within a few weeks after receiving supportive treatment to alleviate headache. Acetaminophen and repeated lumbar punctures may be clinically indicated.
There have been a few clinical trials of treatment; most of those have included eosinophilic  meningitis,  but  not always  specifically  documented Angiostrongylus infection  (Box  1 18-1).  Oral  prednisolone (60 mg/day  divided  into  three  doses)  for  two  weeks  significantly

shortened  the  duration  of  headache  and  the  number  of  repeated lumbar  punctures  when  compared  with  placebo  in  patients  with eosinophilic meningitis presumably from angiostrongyliasis [17]. In 26 eosinophilic meningitis patients using a combination of corticosteriod (prednisolone 60 mg/day divided into three doses) and albendazole (15 mg/kg/day divided into two doses) for two weeks, treated patients had a similar duration of headache compared with patients receiving  prednisolone  only  [18]. Forty-one  patients  treated with a combination of prednisolone and mebendazole (10 mg/kg/day) for two  weeks  had  a  similar  duration  of  headache  compared  with  the previous study with prednisolone treatment [19]. Treatment of eosinophilic  meningitis  with  prednisolone  and  albendazole  was  no different  in  relieving  headache  than  treatment  with  prednisolone alone  [20].  A  small  trial  comparing  the  efficacy  of  albendazole (15 mg/kg/day divided into two doses) and placebo demonstrated a decreased duration of headache in the albendazole treated group [21] (Box 1 18.1).
