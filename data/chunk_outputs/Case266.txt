INTRODUCTION
The viral hemorrhagic fever viruses discussed in this chapter (dengue is  discussed  in  a  separate  chapter)  represent  a  diverse  group  of viruses  from  four  different  families  (Flaviviruses,  Bunyaviruses, Filoviruses,  and  Arenaviruses)  that  are  associated  with  dramatic epidemics and high mortality. Collectively these viruses have a high burden of disease around the world and are transmitted to humans through a variety of mechanisms to include insect vectors (arboviruses), contact with an animal reservoir (zoonotic), or direct contact with  infected  victims  or  material  contaminated  with  infected secretions  (fomites). All  have  an  animal  reservoir and/or  sylvatic life cycle allowing a continuous environmental burden. Despite the diversity among these viruses, they share common features:
- envelope
- and the ability to adapt to a changing environment
- right conditions
- or weapons of mass destruction
- humans associated with high mortalities
- or treat disease
- occur.
Understanding the viruses, epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and treatment as discussed in this chapter is of utmost importance to the clinician and tropical disease provider in recognizing, treating, and taking appropriate biosafety precautions. The social and {nancial impact of these diseases is considerable. In New

Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers

York State from July to November 2015, the surveillance cost to travelers and health care workers potentially exposed during the Ebola outbreak was $9.7 million, $4.3 million in response to a single Ebola case,  and $1.9 million  for  active  monitoring. 1 In  the  Netherlands the costs of Ebola preparedness and response by the Dutch health systems was estimated to be € 12.6 million (approximately $US15 million). 2 For countries directly affected by the Ebola outbreak (Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone) the World Bank estimated the 2014 to 2015 outbreak to have reduced the gross domestic product by 2% to 5% for an estimated cost of $US359 million. 3 This does not account for the indirect costs that resulted from deaths, which is considerable. 4 Considering our history of recurrent outbreaks of the viral hemorrhagic fever viruses; their unique ability to mutate and adapt to different environments; their continued presence in the environment; and human social factors such as rapid global transportation, increasing urbanization, and access to health care in developing countries, we should expect the viral hemorrhagic fever viruses to continue to produce epidemics and regional threats with the potential for global spread.

INTRODUCTION
Yellow fever (YF) virus, a mosquito-borne |avivirus, is present in tropical areas of Africa and South America. In humans, the majority of YF virus infections are asymptomatic. Clinical disease varies from a mild, undifferentiated febrile illness to severe disease with jaundice and hemorrhage. Because no speci{c anti-viral treatment exists for YF, prevention is critical to lower disease risk and mortality.

============================================================
CHUNK 7
============================================================
EPIDEMIOLOGY
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that YF virus causes 200,000 cases of clinical disease and 30,000 deaths globally each  year.  However,  the  majority  of  cases  and  deaths  are  not recognized because of the predominantly rural nature of the disease and  inadequate  surveillance  and  reporting.  Over  the  past  few decades, hundreds of cases have been reported annually in South
America, primarily among men with occupational exposures in forested areas. In Africa, the number of cases reported annually varies substantially (range: 1-5000 cases) and is likely attributable to variations in recognition and reporting. 1 The natural occurrence of disease can also |uctuate, being absent in certain areas for years before re-appearing, as was recently seen in Angola in 2016 and coastal Brazil in 2017. 2 Delineation of affected areas depends on surveillance for animal reservoirs and vectors, accurate diagnosis, and prompt reporting of human cases. 3

NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
YF virus is a positive-sense RNA virus that belongs to the genus Flavivirus (family Flaviviridae). It is antigenically related to dengue, Zika, West Nile, St. Louis encephalitis, and Japanese encephalitis viruses. YF virus has three transmission cycles: jungle, savannah, and urban. 3,4 The jungle cycle involves transmission of the virus between nonhuman primates and tree-hole-breeding  mosquito species (i.e., Aedes or Haemagogus spp.) found in the forest canopy. The virus is transmitted via mosquitoes from monkeys to humans when they encroach into the jungle during occupational or recreational activities. In Africa, a savannah cycle involves transmission of the virus from tree-hole-breeding Aedes spp. to humans living or  working  in  jungle  border  areas.  In  this  cycle,  mosquitoes may also  transmit  the  virus  between  humans. The  urban  cycle involves  transmission  of  the  virus  between  humans  and  urban mosquitoes,  primarily Aedes  aegypti .  Humans  infected  with  YF virus experience the highest levels of viremia and are infectious to  mosquitoes  shortly  before the onset  of fever and  for  3  to  5 days thereafter. Direct person-to-person transmission of YF virus has not been documented; however, perinatal transmission from an infected mother to her infant at the  time of birth  has been reported, 5 and transmission might theoretically occur through blood transfusion, organ transplantation, intrauterine transmission, or breastfeeding.

CLINICAL FEATURES
The majority of people infected with YF virus remain asymptomatic. For those with clinical disease, the incubation period is usually 3 to  9  days. 6 In  its  mildest  form,  YF  is  a  self-limited  infection characterized by acute onset of fever and headache. A subset of patients  experience  other  symptoms,  including  chills,  myalgia, lumbosacral  pain,  anorexia,  nausea,  vomiting,  and  dizziness. 7 Physical  examination  may  demonstrate  relative  bradycardia  in relation to elevated body temperature (Faget's sign). The patient is usually viremic during this period, which lasts for approximately 3 days. Most have an uneventful recovery, but in approximately 12% (range 5% to 26%) of persons who are infected, the illness recurs in a more severe form within 48 hours following the viremic period. 8 The virus is generally absent from the blood during this phase of symptom recrudescence. Symptoms include fever, vomiting, epigastric  pain,  jaundice,  renal  insuf{ciency,  and  cardiovascular instability. A bleeding diathesis can occur with hematemesis, melena, metrorrhagia,  hematuria,  petechiae,  ecchymoses,  and  epistaxis. Physical {ndings include scleral and dermal icterus, hemorrhages, and epigastric tenderness without hepatic enlargement. For patients with severe disease involving hepatorenal dysfunction, the casefatality ratio is 30% to 60%. 8

PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Laboratory {ndings in patients with YF vary based on the severity and  stage  of  illness.  In  the  {rst  week,  leukopenia  may  occur; however,  during  the  second  week  there  may  be  leukocytosis. Hyperbilirubinemia may be present as early as the third day but usually peaks toward the end of the {rst week of illness. Elevations of  serum  transaminase  levels  occur  in  hepatorenal  disease  and may remain elevated for up to 2 months after onset. Patients with hemorrhagic manifestations often have elevated prothrombin and partial  thromboplastin  times,  decreased  platelet  counts  and {brinogen, and presence of {brin-split products.
Laboratory  diagnosis  is  generally  accomplished  by  testing serum  for  viral  RNA  or  virus-speci{c  IgM  and  neutralizing antibodies. 3 During the {rst 3 to 4 days of illness, the virus may be detectable in the serum by isolation or reverse transcription polymerase chain  reaction  (RT-PCR).  However,  by  the  time  a diagnosis of YF is considered, the virus or viral RNA might not be detectable. Therefore, virus isolation and RT-PCR should not be used for excluding the diagnosis of YF. Serologic cross-reactions occur with other |aviviruses (e.g., West Nile or dengue viruses), so positive results should be con{rmed with a more speci{c test (e.g., plaque-reduction neutralization test). Immunohistochemical staining  of  formalin-{xed  material  can  detect YF  viral  antigen in  pathologic  specimens.  Health  care  providers  should  contact their state or local health department or national laboratories for assistance with diagnostic testing for YF virus infections.

PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Preliminary diagnosis is based on the patient' s clinical features, YF vaccination status, and travel history, including location, time of year, and activities. 4 Mild YF cannot be clinically distinguished from a range of other infections. Cases of YF with jaundice must be differentiated from viral hepatitis, malaria, leptospirosis, Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever, Rift Valley fever, typhoid, Q fever, and typhus, as well as drug-induced and toxic causes of jaundice. 1 Other viral hemorrhagic fevers, which usually present without jaundice, include dengue hemorrhagic fever; Lassa fever; Marburg and Ebola virus diseases; and Bolivian, Argentinean, and Venezuelan hemorrhagic fevers.

============================================================
TREATMENT AND PREVENTION
Although multiple drugs have been evaluated or empirically used for YF, none has shown speci{c bene{t. 9 Management is supportive and based on symptoms and the organ systems  involved. Rest, |uids,  and  acetaminophen  or  paracetamol  can  relieve  milder symptoms of fever and myalgia. Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-in|ammatory drugs should be avoided because of the  risk for hemorrhagic complications.
Because no treatment exists, prevention through use of personal protective measures and vaccination is critical to lower disease risk and mortality. Mosquito prevention measures that may lower the risk for YF and other vector-borne infectious diseases include using insect  repellent,  wearing  permethrin-impregnated  clothing,  and staying in accommodations with screened or air-conditioned rooms.
A live-attenuated  YF  vaccine  is  recommended  for  those ≥ 9 months of age who are traveling to or living in areas of South America  and  Africa with a risk of  YF  virus transmission (Fig.  37.1.1). 4,10 Recent evaluations of  existing  data  determined that a single dose of YF vaccine is suf{cient for most individuals to  confer  sustained  lifelong  protective  immunity  against  YF disease. 10-12 International  health  regulations  allow  countries  to require proof of YF vaccination at least 10 days earlier as a condition of entry for travelers arriving from certain countries to prevent importation  and  indigenous  transmission  of  YF  virus. The YF vaccination certi{cate for international travel is valid for life. 13
The most common adverse events reported after vaccination include fever, headache, myalgia, and injection site reactions. 1 Rare but serious adverse events following vaccine administration include immediate hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions, YF vaccineassociated neurologic disease, and YF vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease. 4 T o minimize the risk for serious adverse events, health care providers should vaccinate only persons who are at risk for exposure to YF virus or who require proof of vaccination for country entry, and observe the contraindications and consider the precautions before administering YF vaccine (T able 37.1.1). 1,4,10
