INTRODUCTION
Coccidioidomycosis is caused by dimorphic fungi of the genus Coccidioides. It typically presents as acute and chronic pulmonary disease. The infection may disseminate widely, especially to cutaneous, osseous, and central nervous system (CNS) sites. Coccidioidomycosis  is  a  signi{cant  health  problem  in  the  southwestern United States and Mexico, with about 150,000 infections per year in the United States, 50,000 of which are symptomatic. 1

============================================================
CHUNK 3
============================================================
EPIDEMIOLOGY
Based on molecular genetics, the genus Coccidioides has been divided into C. immitis (mostly California isolates) and C. posadasii (other areas); both species are similarly pathogenic. 2 The mycelial form of the fungus grows just beneath the soil surface and is composed of arthroconidia intercalated with non-viable segments.
The endemic area is the Lower Sonoran Life Zone, marked by arid or semi-arid climates, sandy soil, and mild winters. 2 These conditions are found in the southwestern United States (primarily Arizona, California, New Mexico, and T exas), Bolivia, Paraguay, Argentina,  and Mexico (Fig. 86.1).  Cases  occur infrequently in Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Brazil, and Colombia. 3
The incidence of coccidioidomycosis is increasing in the United States. In Arizona, the number of cases increased 40-fold in 19 years, from 255 in 1990 (incidence rate 7/100,000 population) to 10,233 cases in 2009 (155/100,000). This increase is due to soil disturbance from construction for Arizona's rising population and an in|ux of susceptible individuals into the state. Arizona accounts for 60% of all U.S. cases; the highest rates occurred in its most populous counties (Maricopa, Pima, Pinal). 4 In T ucson, Coccidioides causes 29% of community-acquired pneumonia. 5
In California, from 1995 to 2009, annual incidence rates ranged from 1.9 to 8.4 per 100,000, and increased to 13.8 per 100,000

============================================================

============================================================
Coccidioidomycosis
Gregory M. Anstead, John R. Graybill in 2011. In 2016 cases reached an all-time high of 5372 (13.7 per 100,000); 70% of cases occurred in the Central Valley and Central Coast. The reasons for the increased number of cases in 2016 are uncertain, but may be due to a period of rainfall after  years of drought and soil disturbance due to construction. 6
Risk  factors  for  increased  severity  of  coccidioidomycosis include receiving immunosuppressive medications (corticosteroids, transplant  drugs,  and  tumor  necrosis  factor-alpha  antagonists); pregnancy  (especially  the  third  trimester);  genetic  factors  (i.e., defects  in  the  interleukin  (IL)-12/interferonγ axis  and  STAT3 pathways, certain ABO blood groups, and HLA types); and speci{c races/ethnicities. 3,7 The rates of coccidioidomycosis per 100,000 in  Arizona  in  2009  among  different  ethnic/racial  groups  were African American, 67; Asian Paci{c Islander, 36; Caucasian, 28; and Hispanic, 21. 8 Filipinos and Native Americans are considered high-risk groups. 3,9 Persons with occupations with soil exposure are also at risk for coccidioidomycosis. 9

============================================================
NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
When the soil is disturbed, the fragile mycelia disintegrate into a  cloud of conidia, which can be carried for miles by the wind. Inhaled conidia are phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages and, over several days, convert into the characteristic large (8-24 μ m diameter) spherule (Fig. 86.2). The spherules elaborate endospores, which  multiply,  and  after  3  to  4  days,  hundreds  of  endospores burst out of the mature spherule. The endospores are ingested by neutrophils, but are not killed. These gradually enlarge into the next generation of spherules. 9
Early in the course of infection, Coccidioides can hematogenously disseminate to the skin, bones, and CNS. Clinical manifestations of  these  lesions  can  appear  soon  after  the  acute  infection  or after many months, sometimes without evidence of the primary infection.  Uncontrolled infection often presents  as suppurating abscesses, with draining exudates containing abundant neutrophils and  spherules,  whereas  chronic  low-grade  infection  manifests as  better-formed  granulomas  containing  few  organisms.  Both B  and T  lymphocytes are essential for  host defense, indicating that  a  balanced  Th1/Th2  response  is  necessary  for  protective immunity. 10

============================================================
CLINICAL FEATURES
Coccidioidomycosis  is  asymptomatic  in  over  half  of  patients. Previously, exposed individuals were detected in earlier years by skin  testing,  using  either  coccidioidin  (from  the  mycelia)  or spherulin (from the spherule). Skin test surveys have de{ned the major endemic zones. Skin test reagents became unavailable in the late 1990s, until 2016 when spherulin again became available (Spherusol, Nielsen Biosciences, San Diego, CA).

Primary Infection
Hypersensitivity  reactions  may  occur  with  primary  infection, including  fever,  erythema  nodosum,  erythema  multiforme,  and arthralgias, known as Valley fever, after the San Joaquin Valley of California, a major endemic focus. 2 These may be the only manifestations of primary coccidioidomycosis, or may blend into the invasive forms of disease.

============================================================
Pulmonary Infection
Most symptomatic patients have a transient pulmonary infection occurring 1 to 3 weeks after exposure, manifesting as fever, dry cough, and pleuritic chest pain. This is usually indistinguishable from community-acquired pneumonia. 2,9 Typically, the symptoms of acute pulmonary coccidioidomycosis resolve spontaneously in less  than  a  month. Alternatively,  the  pulmonary  in{ltrates  may condense into nodules that resolve or persist asymptomatically. Although primary pneumonia usually resolves, in 5% to 19% of patients, the disease may linger for months, with chronic pulmonary in{ltrates, cough, and pleuritic chest pain. Pulmonary in{ltrates
can cavitate. Cavitary disease can be asymptomatic or cause chronic productive cough and occasional hemoptysis, or rupture into the pleura. 2 Cavities may also develop secondary bacterial or Aspergillus (fungus ball) infection. Small cavities ( < 5 cm diameter) are more likely to resolve spontaneously than large ones. Chronic pulmonary coccidioidomycosis may follow a waxing and waning course or be  slowly  progressive  over  years. 9 Uncommonly,  patients  have fulminating pneumonia, with  diffuse reticulonodular in{ltrates, fever, and hypoxia (Fig. 86.3). Aggressive pulmonary disease can occur  in  pregnancy,  especially  the  last  trimester,  and  in  other conditions associated with immunosuppression. 9

============================================================
Extrapulmonary Disease
Disseminated coccidioidomycosis  occurs  in  about  1% of  those infected,  with  a  fatal  course  in  one-third  of  these  patients. 7 Extrapulmonary coccidioidomycosis usually presents as skin lesions (papules, nodules, abscesses, verrucous plaques, ulcers) (Fig. 86.4), lymphadenitis, deep abscesses, osteoarticular disease (manifested by lytic bone lesions and thickened synovium), or CNS disease, but nearly any organ can be involved. 2,9

Meningitis and Other CNS Disease
CNS manifestations include meningitis, encephalitis, mass lesions, and vasculitis. 11 Coccidioidal meningitis presents as progressive headache, cranial neuropathies, and altered mental status. 2 Granuloma formation can cause focal neurologic signs. The cerebrospinal |uid  (CSF)  shows  lymphocytosis  and  hypoglycorrhachia.  CSF eosinophilia, if present, is a helpful diagnostic clue, and the CSF is usually positive for IgG antibody. CSF cultures are positive in < 50% of cases. Untreated, coccidioidal meningitis is fatal within 2 years. 9 CNS vasculitis presents as a strokelike syndrome. 11

============================================================
Soft Tissue and Osteoarticular Disease
Soft tissue involvement in coccidioidomycosis ranges from scattered chronic verrucous granulomatous lesions to suppurating abscesses containing large numbers of spherules. In general, lesions with purulent  drainage  are  associated  with  a  worse  prognosis.  Coccidioidal osteomyelitis often involves the vertebrae (Fig. 86.5) and can be associated with compression fractures. Synovitis of large joints  is  common. Coccidioides can  be  cultured  from  a  synovial specimen more frequently than from joint |uid. Blood cultures can be positive in disseminated disease; this is an indicator of poor prognosis. 9

COCCIDIOIDOMYCOSIS IN CHILDREN
Children  are  susceptible  to  coccidioidomycosis,  with  reported incidence of hospitalizations in endemic regions of 8 to 12/100,000. In one series, 56% of hospitalized children had pulmonary disease, 14% had progressive disease, and 7% had meningitis. A third of pediatric  patients  had  co-morbid  conditions,  usually  immunode{ciency or malignancy; none died during their {rst hospitalization. 12 Coccidioidal serologic tests are not recommended for the evaluation  of  infants  during  the  {rst  3  months  of  life;  positive tests must be interpreted cautiously during the {rst year. Breastfeeding  is  not  recommended  for  mothers  on  azoles  other  than |uconazole. 13

============================================================
PATIENT EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS
Coccidioidomycosis  should  be  considered  in  the  differential diagnosis of a compatible illness occurring in a resident or visitor to an endemic area. Rapid diagnostic methods are examination of  sputum  or  exudates  from  purulent  lesions  for  spherules,  or detection  of  spherules  on  histopathology  of  cutaneous  lesions, bronchoscopy specimens, or lymph nodes. The morphology of Coccidioides spherules is nearly pathognomonic. 9
The gold-standard technique for the diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis is culture of the organism. The spherules in sputum, exudates, or tissue convert to mycelia, which grow in 7 to 10 days. Fresh  tissue  samples  from Coccidioides -infected  patients  are  not directly hazardous, but must be disposed of or rendered non-viable quickly,  before  the  fungus  converts  to  mycelia  and  produces arthroconidia. Plates with suspected mycelia should be sealed and opened only in biohazard facilities. Careless handling of culture plates has caused coccidioidomycosis in laboratory personnel. 9
IgM  antibodies  develop  within  weeks  after  infection  but are not sustained. IgG antibodies take 1 to 2 months to appear in  blood  and  CSF  and  persist  for  many  months. Titers > 1  :  16 correlate  with  increased  severity  of  illness,  and  declining  titers re|ect  clinical  improvement.  However,  in  practice,  these  titers change slowly with the patient's improving clinical status. Also, in severe immunode{ciency, antibody titers may be low, or even negative. 2 A  urinary  antigen  test  is  available  from  MiraVista Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN), with 71% sensitivity in moderate to severe disease, versus 87% for culture. There is some crossreactivity with Histoplasma antigens. 14 There is also a commercially available  polymerase  chain  reaction  (PCR)  test  (Mayo  Medical Laboratories, Rochester, MN) that can utilize either body |uids or tissue.

============================================================
TREATMENT
Treatment guidelines were published in 2016. 13 Coccidioides isolates are usually susceptible to amphotericin B and azoles in vitro, but treatment responses are highly dependent on host factors (immunocompetence and race/ethnicity). 1,2,9 In a study of the susceptibility of 581 Coccidioides isolates, elevated minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were observed for 37% of isolates to |uconazole ( ≥ 16 g/mL) versus 1% of isolates for itraconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole. However, studies of the relationship between MIC values and patient outcomes are necessary to determine the relevance of these data in antifungal selection. 15 Clinical experience with echinocandins is limited. 9,15
Treatment  courses  for  any  form  of  coccidioidomycosis  are prolonged and should continue months after improvement. Because some lesions can progress while  others  wane, a scoring system has been developed that incorporates signs and symptoms, cultures, radiographically apparent lesions, and serologic titers. A reduction of a cumulative score to less than 50% of baseline is considered a response to therapy. As cultures are often not repeated (especially if invasive methods are required) and serologic titers change slowly, the total burden of disease has been measured using clinical signs and  symptoms  and  radiographic  evaluation  of  lesion  size.  In coccidioidal meningitis, normalization of CSF {ndings indicates treatment response. 9
Selection  of  the  antifungal  agent  depends,  in  part,  on  the involved site and the severity of disease. 1,13 No treatment is recommended for asymptomatic coccidiomas, which are often resected during a search for presumptive lung cancer. The nephrotoxicity of amphotericin B initially discouraged physicians from treating primary coccidioidal pneumonia, which usually resolves spontaneously. However, all patients require observation for at least 2 years to  document  resolution  of  infection  and  to  promptly  identify complications.  Fluconazole  has  been  increasingly  used  to  treat primary coccidioidal pneumonia. Nevertheless, there are no clear data to con{rm its ef{cacy in primary coccidioidal pneumonia or in prevention of dissemination. 13

============================================================
CHUNK 15
============================================================
TREATMENT
For patients at risk for disseminated disease, antifungal treatment of primary coccidioidal pneumonia is appropriate. Other indications for treatment are severe disease: in{ltrates involving both lungs or more than half of one lung, hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy, IgG titers > 1  :  16,  and  highly  symptomatic  disease  (weight  loss > 10%, night  sweats > 3  weeks,  symptoms > 2  months).  Patients with signs of chronic pulmonary infection, such as weight loss, night sweats, and multi-lobar in{ltrates, and symptoms for more than 2 months should also be treated. 1
Based  on  its  excellent  tolerability,  linear  renal  clearance, limited  drug  interactions,  and  ef{cacy,  |uconazole  is  the  drug of choice for less severely ill patients. In one trial, the response rate  in  chronic  pulmonary  and  disseminated  disease  was  50% for |uconazole versus 63% for itraconazole. 16 Fluconazole doses of  400 mg/day  are  often  used  initially,  but  slow  responses  and failures in meningitis have led physicians to use doses as high as 1000 to 1200 mg per day. 1,13 T reatment for 6 months has been suggested  for  primary  pneumonia  and  longer  than  12  months after response for severe or chronic pulmonary or disseminated disease. 1
Although  itraconazole  is  slightly  superior  to  |uconazole  in patients with skeletal disease, its less predictable pharmacokinetics and more frequent adverse events have rendered itraconazole a secondary  drug. 9 Itraconazole  is  administered  orally,  either  as capsules with a fatty meal or as a solution in the fasted state, at 400  to  600 mg/day.  Larger  studies  have  been  conducted  with capsules, which are better tolerated but less predictably absorbed. Itraconazole inhibits and is metabolized by cytochrome 3A4, so its  drug  interactions  are  extensive. There  is  limited  experience with itraconazole in the treatment of meningitis compared with |uconazole. 9

============================================================
CHUNK 16
============================================================
TREATMENT
For life-threatening coccidioidomycosis, amphotericin B or a lipid formulation is recommended. 1,13 The latter is preferred because of  its  modestly  decreased  risk  of  nephrotoxicity.  There  is  no evidence that high doses of the lipid formulations (e.g., 10 mg/ kg) are more effective than doses of 3 to 6 mg/kg. Responses to amphotericin therapy of 50% to 70% are seen. 9 When the patient
has improved or when nephrotoxicity occurs, treatment is shifted to azoles for ongoing therapy. 1,13
Because  the  azoles  may  be  teratogenic,  amphotericin  B  is preferred during the {rst trimester of pregnancy. If nephrotoxicity develops, azole treatment may be necessary for at least a limited time, preferably later in pregnancy. 9
A challenge in the management of coccidioidomycosis is the selection  of  a  salvage  agent  when  initial  therapy  fails  or  when the patient relapses (which may be years later). For azole failures, the  2016  guidelines  recommend  amphotericin  B. 13 However, voriconazole or posaconazole may also be considered. Voriconazole at doses of 400 to 600 mg/day has proven successful in a number of  patients  with  refractory  disease. 17 Another  salvage  option  is posaconazole. Published clinical  experience  for posaconazole  is limited to its suspension form, given 200 mg four times per day with a fatty meal. More than half of salvage patients responded to  posaconazole. 18 Posaconazole  has  also  been  used  as  primary therapy with responses of 85% in 20 patients. 19 Unfortunately, relapses occurred in a third of patients who initially responded. Both voriconazole and posaconazole show high in vitro activity against Coccidioides, but the posaconazole suspension has variable oral  bioavailability.  Delayed-release  posaconazole  tablets  with improved oral bioavailability and an intravenous preparation are available. 20 These  new  forms  of  posaconazole may  prove to be more ef{cacious. Experience with isavuconazole is limited; in a series of nine patients with pulmonary coccidioidomycosis, complete or partial success was observed in 56% of patients, but only 22% had complete resolution. 21

CHUNK 17
============================================================
TREATMENT
For meningitis, treatment has changed dramatically with the availability of |uconazole; previously, intrathecal amphotericin B was  required.  However,  intrathecal  amphotericin  B  can  cause arachnoiditis  and  vasculitis  and  should  be  administered  with corticosteroids to suppress these in|ammatory adverse events. 9 It is seldom used in the post-|uconazole era, except for the treatment of  coccidioidal  meningitis  in  the  {rst  trimester  of  pregnancy. 13 Posaconazole and  voriconazole have also been used with  some success in meningitis. 17,22 For patients with increased intracranial pressure  at  the  time  of  meningitis  diagnosis,  repeated  lumbar punctures are recommended. 13 Hydrocephalus  may  require ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunting. In patients with CNS vasculitis with cerebrovascular accident due to coccidioidomycosis, those who received corticosteroids were less likely to develop additional infarcts compared with those who did not. 15 Patients with meningitis require lifelong antifungal therapy. 1,9,13
Vertebral  osteomyelitis  may  require surgical  stabilization  or spinal cord/nerve root decompression. 13 For patients with a ruptured coccidioidal cavity, resection and decortication are recommended. 13 Reduction  of  immunosuppression  is  an  important  adjunct  to antifungal therapy, including the initiation of antiretroviral therapy if  the  patient  has  HIV  infection. 1 In  patients  with  AIDS  and non-meningeal  coccidioidomycosis,  antifungal  therapy  can  be discontinued when the CD4 count exceeds 250 cells/mm 3 . 13
