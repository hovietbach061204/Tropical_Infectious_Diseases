KEY FEATURES
- bacterium, Shigella, which destroys ileal and colonic epithelium and elicits a local and systemic in|ammatory response.
- Shigella species cause infection, with clinical presentations varying by species and serotype. Of these, Shigella dysenteriae type 1, which has become rare since the start of the new millennium, is associated with pandemic and epidemic disease and the highest mortality rate.
- Shigella. Infection occurs by fecal-oral or human-to-human transmission where hygiene and sanitation are problematic, such as in developing countries or in daycare centers.
- syndrome, characterized by tenesmus, cramps, passage of bloody-mucoid stools, and fever.
- Shigella who have dysentery or systemic symptoms bene{t from antimicrobial therapy. The value of antimicrobial treatment is uncertain in patients with uncomplicated Shigella infection and watery diarrhea.
- developing country settings, the decision to initiate treatment with an antimicrobial agent should be empiric, based upon a presumptive clinical diagnosis (dysentery being the distinguishing feature) and knowledge of the antimicrobial resistance pattern of circulating strains.
- effective in treatment of shigellosis has left only two drugs that are widely available for outpatient treatment: cipro|oxacin (or similar |uoroquinolones) and azithromycin. Increasing resistance to these two agents may presage a time when there are no effective agents for the treatment of shigellosis.
- shigellosis, including hemolytic uremic syndrome (with S. dysenteriae type 1), reactive arthritis, and seizures.

INTRODUCTION
Shigella infection, though ubiquitous globally, is a much different disease in poor and middle-income countries than in rich countries. Especially  in  poor  countries  it  remains  an  important  cause  of death  and  results  in  substantial  morbidity,  affecting  nutrition, growth, and susceptibility to future infections. In rich countries it occurs most commonly in daycare settings, among men having sex with men, and in food-based outbreaks. This chapter will focus on  the  clinical  manifestations,  diagnosis,  and  management  of shigellosis in poor countries, where more than 90% of all Shigella infections occur.

HISTORY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY
Shigella dysenteriae type 1, a gram-negative bacillus, was identi{ed by the Japanese microbiologist Kiyoshi Shiga as a cause of the dysentery syndrome in 1897. 1 Subsequently, three other species of Shigella causing endemic dysentery or diarrhea were identi{ed and received eponymous species names ( S. Rexneri, S. boydii, and S. sonnei ). 1 These species are further characterized by serotyping, with  over  50  serotypes  identi{ed  (with S.  sonnei having  only  a single serotype). Infection with S. dysenteriae type 1, the only species that produces Shiga toxin, causes the most severe disease, S. sonnei generally the least severe, and S. Rexneri infection causing disease of intermediate severity. 2
Estimates of the disease burden from Shigella infection  vary depending on  the population  studied,  the  diagnostic  test  used, and methods used to generalize survey results to the global population. 3,4 Whatever the methods used, Shigella infections are among the  four  most  common  pathogens  causing  enteric  infection worldwide. 5 And if sensitive molecular diagnostic techniques are used , and adjustment made for asymptomatic carriage of pathogens, Shigella may be the most common cause of moderate to severe enteric infections. 4 The highest incidence of disease is in children ages  1  to  4  years,  an  age  group  in  which  it  is  often  the  most common cause of enteric infection. 6 Because immunity is in part serotype speci{c, adults are susceptible to infection even if they have previously been infected with another serotype of Shigella. Shigella infections are the second-most common cause of diarrhea mortality after rotavirus, causing an estimated 55,000 deaths globally in children less than 5 years of age. 7 In contrast to most enteric infections, more deaths from Shigella occur in older children and adults (an estimated 110,000) than in those under 5 years of age. 8

============================================================
HISTORY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY
Humans are the only reservoir of Shigella (non-human primates will develop dysentery if challenged but play no role in transmission in  community  settings).  Asymptomatic  long-term  carriage  is uncommon. Shigellae are not hardy in the environment, so the role of fomites is limited. Shigellosis is associated with poor hygiene and underdevelopment. Infections usually result from fecal-oral spread from an infected individual. Flies may play a role in spreading infection. T ransmission by water or by commercial food products occurs and is proportionally more common in rich countries. Men who have sex with men and persons with HIV infection are at increased risk for Shigella infection, especially severe disease. 9 This has resulted in changes in the age-distribution pattern of shigellosis in many rich countries but has not had a substantial effect on the epidemiologic  pattern  of  shigellosis  in  poor  countries. Shigella transmission is facilitated by the very low infectious inoculum, with fewer than 100 organisms capable of transmitting infection.
In wealthy, industrialized countries S. sonnei is the predominant cause of infection; the more virulent S. Rexneri is less common. The reverse is true in relatively poor countries, where S. Rexneri predominates (Fig. 48.1). The switch from a preponderance  of S. Rexneri infections to S. sonnei infections may be a marker of a country's social and economic development. 10
Epidemics of dysentery, especially those with high mortality rates, are caused by S. dysenteriae type 1 infections. Endemic and epidemic S. dysenteriae type 1 infections had, in the last decades of the 20th century, most commonly occurred in South Asia and central and east Africa. Since 2000, S. dysenteriae type 1 infections have become rare worldwide. The reasons for this are not understood. S. dysenteriae type 1 has previously become uncommon for

decades only to reappear in lethal epidemics, 11 a pattern that could presumably recur. Infections with S. boydii have historically been most common in South Asia, but account for only a minority of infections even in locations where this species is endemic. Infections with S. dysenteriae other than type 1 are even less common.

============================================================
NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY
Shigella infections have a usual incubation period of 1 to 3 days, with untreated disease lasting 5 days or more. Shigellosis is an infection of the distal ileum and colon. Shigellae are enteroinvasive, that is, they invade, multiply within, and destroy colonic epithelial cells. This results in tissue destruction, mucosal ulceration, disruption of small vessels and hemorrhage, and microabscesses in the colon (Fig. 48.2). Infection and in|ammation are most severe in the rectosigmoid and less severe proximally. 12
Fig. 48.3 Characteristic dysenteric stool of a patient with shigellosis containing blood, mucus, and small amounts of fecal matter.
Infection  elicits-both locally  and  systemically-a profound in|ammatory response with an outpouring of polymorphonuclear cells and mucus. This, along with the blood from the ulceration and destruction of small vessels in the colonic epithelium, results in  the  characteristic  dysenteric  stool  (Fig.  48.3).  The  systemic in|ammatory response is re|ected in the chills, fever, and profound malaise that often precede the dysentery.
Virulence in Shigella is primarily controlled by a 220-kb virulence plasmid that has genes encoding adherence and invasion of colonic epithelial  cells  and  spread  within  and  between  cells.  It  is  this plasmid that makes Shigella distinct from Escherichia coli, which it otherwise closely resembles genetically. Shigella survival is enhanced by  inducing  apoptosis  in  macrophages,  thus  circumventing  an important component of the host response.
S. dysenteriae type 1 produces an exotoxin, Shiga toxin, which inhibits protein synthesis. Its precise role in the pathogenesis of infection remains unclear, but it probably induces vascular damage

that results in both the more severe colitis and systemic complications. The latter include hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) and leukemoid reaction that almost never occur with other species or serotypes  of Shigella. 2   NonS.  dysenteriae type  1  serotypes  only rarely (via a lysogenic bacteriophage) have the genetic capability to produce toxin. Additional enterotoxinsShigella enterotoxins (ShET) 1 and 2-are implicated in the  watery  diarrhea that  is often the presenting feature of shigellosis.

============================================================
CHUNK 9
============================================================
CLINICAL FEATURES
The  hallmark  of Shigella infection  is  dysentery-the  frequent, painful passage of small-volume stools that consist of mucus, blood, in|ammatory cells, and fecal matter (see Fig. 48.3) accompanied by tenesmus and cramping. All of these features are a result of the in|ammatory and ulcerative changes in the colon. In children with severe colitis, the repeated straining that is associated with the tenesmus can result in rectal prolapse (Fig. 48.4).
Watery diarrhea, rather than dysentery, can often be the presenting intestinal symptom. 2 In many patients, especially those with S.  sonnei infection,  the  diarrhea  remains  watery  and  dysentery never occurs. 13
Intestinal  complications are most  common, but not limited, to S. dysenteriae type 1 infection (T able 48.1). Complications include toxic colitis, 14 which causes obstruction and systemic toxicity and mimics  the  toxic  colitis  seen  with  ulcerative  colitis  (Fig.  48.5A and B) gut perforation, and a protein-losing enteropathy. 15
A host of systemic, non-intestinal complications can occur with shigellosis, most of which appear to be more common and more severe among malnourished children in developing countries (see Table 48.1). 2
Fever  is  a  characteristic  of  most Shigella infections  and  can often be high (40°C) and sustained. The rapid rise of fever with shigellosis leads to a relatively high incidence of seizures in young children  who  are  infected  ( ≈ 5%  in  one  study  of  hospitalized patients) 16 and can occur with infection of any of the species of Shigella. 16 Metabolic  complications  can  also  produce  seizures (Fig. 48.6).
Lethargy  and  confusion  are  common  in  severe  shigellosis; obtundation  and  coma  may  also  occur. 16 These  mental  status changes may result from the metabolic derangements or because shigellosis, especially S. dysenteriae type 1, induces more generalized, but poorly understood, neurologic complications.
Metabolic complications (see T able 48.1) include hypoglycemia from inadequate gluconeogenesis 17 and hyponatremia, presumably from inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. Though the

CLINICAL FEATURES
blood loss from the intestinal micro-hemorrhages is usually not severe  enough  to  cause  anemia,  it  may  exacerbate  pre-existing anemia. Hypoproteinemia can occur from a combination of protein loss in the gut, diminished nutrition during illness, and systemic in|ammation causing diminished protein synthesis. 11
Shigella may also rarely cause infection of epithelial surfaces outside the gut, including the cornea and the vagina, 12,13 and may also  be  systemically  invasive,  causing  sepsis  from  bloodstream invasion by Shigella or other gut |ora. 18
Shigella infection is the development of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). 16 This complication occurs almost exclusively with S. dysenteriae type 1 and is similar to the HUS seen with enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), which produces a similar exotoxin. In addition to microangiopathic anemia and renal failure, leukemoid reaction (peripheral blood polymorphonuclear cell count > 50,000 mm 3 ) and thrombocytopenia may occur in association with HUS, or separately as a 'forme fruste' of HUS.

PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The diagnosis of shigellosis is  important  because antimicrobial therapy  provides  substantial  bene{t  to  patients  with  dysentery caused by Shigella. Antimicrobial therapy both relieves the suffering that occurs from the primary disease-tenesmus is an agonizing condition-and can prevent complications. 19
Although isolation of Shigella from  stool  is  required  for  the de{nitive diagnosis of shigellosis, the time required for isolation (48 hours), the lack of diagnostic microbiologic facilities at most health facilities in developing countries, and the insensitivity of current culture methods require that antimicrobial treatment be based upon a presumptive clinical diagnosis.
In developing countries where shigellosis is endemic, children with  dysentery  have  a  high  probability  of  being  infected  with Shigella. In  adults,  other causes of dysentery are more common than  in  children,  but  all  patients  with  severe  dysentery  in  the tropics still have a high probability of having shigellosis.
Other features supportive of the diagnosis of shigellosis include abdominal tenderness, fever (though less common in malnourished children),  and  rectal  prolapse.  During  an S.  dysenteriae type  1 epidemic,  the  probability  that  dysentery  is  a  result  of Shigella infection is even greater.
The laboratory test most likely to be available in developing countries is microscopic examination of the stool using either a wet  mount  or  Gram  stain.  Either  will  show  large  numbers  of polymorphonuclear  cells  and  erythrocytes.  Other  supportive laboratory tests include a peripheral blood count with leukocytosis. Though rapid bedside tests for identi{cation of Shigella infection have been developed, none are currently in widespread use.
If  microbiologic  laboratory  facilities  are  available,  de{nitive diagnosis is done by isolation of Shigella from the stool. Shigellae

are  not  hardy.  Thus  cultures  are  best  done  by  plating  a  stool sample at the bedside or immediately transporting a sample to the laboratory. Samples requiring a delay are best transported in buffered-glycerol saline, which has a higher yield than the more commonly available Cary-Blair  transport  media.  Stool samples are  plated  upon  media  selective  for  gram-negative  organisms. Shigella does not ferment lactose and thus appears white or colorless on  selective media  containing  acid-sensitive  indicator dyes. Non-lactose-fermenting colonies are then further analyzed using biochemical  tests for  de{nitive  con{rmation  that they are Shigella.

Antimicrobial Therapy
Antimicrobial drugs are the de{nitive treatment for shigellosis, and all  persons  with  symptomatic  shigellosis  in  poor  countries should receive antimicrobial therapy. Greatest ef{cacy is achieved when treatment is initiated early in the course of illness. Controlled trials from the 1950s onward established the value of antimicrobial therapy in children and  adults  with  shigellosis and dysentery. 21 Treatment shortens the course of illness and pathogen excretion, and  reduces  complications  and  mortality. 22 There  is  increasing evidence that  watery  diarrhea caused  by Shigella infection  may lead to increased mortality and have long-term nutritional and developmental effects. 23 The challenge remains of how to identify such patients in the much larger universe of children with watery diarrhea not requiring antimicrobial therapy. General characteristics of drugs effective in shigellosis are shown in Box 48.1. 21
Drugs meeting these criteria must still show ef{cacy in clinical trials. Oral cephalosporins, for instance, have proven ineffective, 24 mainstays of therapy-ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, nalidixic acid, and tetracycline-are no longer useful because of widespread resistance (indeed, the transfer of multiple-antibiotic

Antimicrobial Therapy
The |uoroquinolones and azithromycin are the current drugs of choice for treating shigellosis (T able 48.2). Diminished susceptibility  and  frank  resistance to these are increasing. 25,26 Because intracellular concentrations of azithromycin are much higher than serum  concentrations, laboratory thresholds for identifying resistance  (which  have  not  been  de{ned  for Shigella but  are extrapolated  from  other  Enterobacteriaceae)  may  not  correlate when infected with isolates with high-level resistance. Knowledge of the prevalence of resistance in a community is a prerequisite for deciding on empiric therapy. This requires ongoing surveillance-something  often  lacking  in  developing  countries where shigellosis is most common. No new drugs for the treatment of  shigellosis  have  been  introduced  in  the  more  than  20  years since azithromycin was {rst evaluated for treatment of shigellosis in 1997, 27 and none are on the near horizon.

Equally important is early feeding. 28 Because of the anorexia, protein loss in the gut, and increased metabolism, the development of malnutrition (or exacerbation of pre-existing malnutrition) is an important complication of shigellosis. Aggressive feeding with a high-protein diet can ameliorate the nutritional deterioration that follows dysentery with Shigella and also help prevent hypoglycemia. In infants, continued breastfeeding should be encouraged throughout the course of the illness. Nasogastric feeding can be used in children who are severely anorexic.
Supplemental zinc  reduces  the  severity  and  duration  of  the acute infection and reduces the incidence and severity of diarrhea in the 3 months after infection. Vitamin A supplementation has not shown bene{t during the acute infection, but has other potential bene{ts. Doses for vitamin A and zinc are shown in Box 48.2.
Rectal prolapse is best treated with warm magnesium sulfate compresses to reduce edema. Convulsions that occur in the absence of any metabolic derangements, such as hyponatremia or hypoglycemia, are usually not complex or sustained and are best managed using local protocols for the management of febrile convulsions in children, including the provision of antipyretics.

Pivmecillinam (registered as amdinocillin pivoxil in the United States, where it currently is not available), Comments = In contrast to ampicillin, pivmecillinam selectively binds to penicillin-binding protein 2 and is relatively resistant to many common β -lactamases, thus may be effective in treatment of strains resistant to ampicillin.

Ceftriaxone, Adult.Duration = . Ceftriaxone, Comments = Because this agent must be administered parenterally, it is reserved for use in patients who are infected with strains of Shigella drugs or are severely ill and need parenteral drugs in hospital. It has not been evaluated in controlled studies for treatment of S. dysenteriae type 1. For infection with other species of Shigella, both two-dose 2-day and of therapy have proven effective. Although not evaluated in adults, there is no reason to believe it would not be effective. In controlled trials, oral cephalosporins have been ineffective in the treatment of shigellosis of moderate or greater severity, and should not be used.

PREVENTION
Although efforts to develop an effective vaccine are ongoing, vaccine development is complicated by the multiple serotypes in circulation. No candidate  vaccine  has  shown  suf{cient  ef{cacy  to  warrant extensive clinical trials or licensing. 29 Control of shigellosis for the foreseeable future requires improvement in hygiene and nutrition (including encouraging breastfeeding), appropriate identi{cation and treatment of those who are infected, and improvement in socioeconomic conditions. The latter is likely to reduce the household crowding and lack of access to potable water that facilitate Shigella transmission. Indeed reduction in levels of poverty over the past decades has been accompanied by decreases in Shigella mortality, 8 a trend that is hopefully likely to continue.
