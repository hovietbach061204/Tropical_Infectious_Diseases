5. Offer reassurance and/or confirm diagnosis or proof of cure following illness, such as febrile systemic illness, diarrheal disease, or rash, that occurred during travel.
6. Provide information about the consequence of any illness during travel in view of future travel, e.g. dengue.
7. Review a traveler's compliance with preventative measures, including  their  experience  of  malaria  chemoprophylaxis, and review their vaccination status.
8. Provide  a  lifestyle  assessment  -  diet,  exercise,  alcohol, smoking, BMI, stress.
9. Review  pre-existing  medical  conditions  and  medication; provide a cardiovascular, neoplastic (cervical, breast, prostate, colon), and psychological review.
10. Where relevant, determine fitness at the end of a period of work.
There is uncertainty about the ideal timing of conducting a post-travel consultation. Infections with a long incubation may be overlooked. An  additional  medical  visit  3  months  after  return  may  be  recommended in order to detect infections such as HIV.
Referral to a specialist center for advice and management is essential for those clinicians with little or no experience of managing returned travelers.  A  sound knowledge of destination-specific risks, mode of acquisition and incubation periods of diseases, and of the sensitivity and specificity of screening tests is necessary.

HISTORY
History is the cornerstone of the post-travel consultation. The clinician must take a detailed history in order to assess the likelihood of exposure to infectious and noninfectious travel-associated risks and assess the magnitude and potential impact of that risk [1].
The  clinician  should  ask,  what  might  this  person,  from  this  place, have been exposed to, that may cause them ill health at some time? And so they must consider:
- Person - age, gender, socioeconomic status (including immigrant/ refugee status), occupation, sexual orientation, travel experience/ knowledge, personal risk profile (risk aversion/perception), preexisting  health  conditions  (including  medication),  pre-travel preparation (vaccinations, chemoprophylaxis), compliance during travel with pre-travel advice, and any illness.
- Place - exact destination, itinerary, season, accommodation, duration, and date of return. Diseases can be destination-specific: e.g. Loa loa is confined to equatorial regions of West Africa, tick typhus is a disease of the East and southern African savannah, and gastrointestinal and soil-transmitted infections are ubiquitous.
- Exposures - an exposure history should detail:

INTRODUCTION
The long-term traveler can be defined as those traveling or residing overseas  for  more  than  6  months  and  includes  those  going  on extended  holidays  (gap  year/backpackers/visiting  friends  and  relatives) and those residing overseas in order to work or volunteer (expatriates). The type and extent of risk to the health of long-term travelers, and the screening of them on return, varies considerably according to the individual, their destination/s, duration, and purpose of travel.
Screening of travelers is a medical review undertaken to identify risk factors  that  may  have  implications  for  the  health  of  the  traveler. Screening can lead to more extensive evaluation or can be diagnostic on its own. There are little data and no uniformly accepted guidelines or extensive cost/benefit analyses for screening of the asymptomatic long-term traveler.
It is accepted that a post-travel consultation is an opportunity to:
1. Discuss exposure to infectious disease risks and assess the necessity for and timing of screening.
2. Target investigations of latent infections that may have deleterious consequences if unrecognized.
3. Counsel the traveler and reduce the risk of secondary transmission of infections, e.g. tuberculosis, salmonellosis, scabies, and HIV.
4. Inform the traveler of potential disease manifestations that can occur at a later stage, e.g. Plasmodium vivax malaria, and consider presumptive treatment strategies.

INTRODUCTION
- Safety risks: threats experienced to personal safety.
- Environmental risks: exposures to altitude, sun, extremes of temperature,  and  specific  environments,  including  soiltransmitted  helminths  (strongyloides,  hookworm,  other intestinal  helminths), freshwater  contact  (schistosomiasis, leptospirosis), caves (histoplasmosis), game parks (trypanosomiasis),  safari  (African  tick  typhus)  equatorial  forest (loiasis, onchocerciasis), and marine environments (stings, coral infections/necrosis).
- Food-  and  water-borne  risks:  general  hygiene  measures, water access, ingestion of raw/undercooked meat/fish, and unpasteurized products (e.g. amebiasis, brucellosis, giardiasis, intestinal helminths).
- Vector-borne risks (including animals): measures taken to prevent  insect  exposures;  bites/skin  wounds  received  (e.g. malaria, filariasis, trypanosomiasis, rabies).
- Airborne risks: close contact with people potentially infected with tuberculosis.
- Sexual  health  and  blood-borne  virus  risks:  unprotected contact and potential exposure to HIV, hepatitis B and C, and other sexually transmitted infections.
- Skin health: skin wounds, UV damage, rash, and any symptoms such as itch.
- Psychological health: positive and negative  experiences of travel, readjustment issues, and any ongoing mental health concerns.

============================================================
EXAMINATION
In  asymptomatic travelers, physical examination is  often of limited value.  However,  examination  may  reveal  previously  undetected lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, hypertension, cardiac/ pulmonary  dysfunction,  and  skin  disorders.  A  full  examination  is therefore necessary.

============================================================
CHUNK 6
============================================================
GENERAL SCREENING TESTS
Laboratory  tests  are  often  insensitive,  nonspecific  and  may  not  be available for conditions in their pre-clinical stage, as is the case for malaria. Minimal laboratory tests comprise a total blood count and differential, liver transaminases, blood urea, and creatinine levels, as well as targeted serologic markers according to exposure (see below). Microscopic examination of stool for ova, cysts, and parasites, a urine dip-stick and, when appropriate a 'terminal urine' for schistosomiasis, should be performed. Fasting blood glucose, lipids, thyroid function tests,  and neoplastic markers (e.g. PSA) are optional for  those wanting a comprehensive health review (Fig. 145.1).

============================================================
CHUNK 7
============================================================
Assess necessity for screening:
Was the traveler exposed to specific health risks whilst abroad?
Is there a need to alleviate the traveler's concerns?
Has there been an appropriate interval between presentation for screening and the end of the trip to allow detection of latent disease?
Clinical history: geography, activities, pre-travel immunizations, antimalarials, and compliance.
Are there specific disease exposures that may be asymptomatic, based on travel destination and activities?
Health: pre-existing health conditions, illness and treatment during travel, e.g. fever, diarrhea, rash

Specific enquiries regarding risks:
Food and water general hygiene: ingestion of raw meat or fish, and unpasteurized dairy products
Fresh water contacts e.g. schistosomiasis
Soil contact e.g. strongyloides, hookworm
Visits to caves e.g. histoplasmosis and rabies (rare)
Sexual contact and risks e.g. HIV, syphilis, chlamydia
Blood-borne virus risks (injuries, blood transfusions, tattoos, piercings) e.g. HIV, hepatitis B and C
Healthcare worker e.g. needle stick injury, clinical setting with high rates of TB
Game parks and walking safari risk of ticks and tsetse fly bites, e.g. rickettsial infections and trypanosomiasis
Equatorial forests: onchocerciasis, loiasis in Central and West Africa
Accommodation: e.g. mud huts in South America (risk of Trypanosomiasis cruzi infection).

============================================================
Eosinophilia
Eosinophilia  can  indicate  parasitic  infection  with  helminths,  especially with nematodes, trematodes, or larval cestodes (see also Chapter 143). It is more marked when blood and tissue migration occurs, as in Strongyloides stercoralis , schistosomiasis, blood filariasis, and intestinal helminths (ascaris, hookworm), but less so in lymphatic filariasis. Individuals with such infections may also have normal eosinophil counts.
The  sensitivity  of  eosinophilia  as  a  screening  tool  for  helminth infection in asymptomatic long-term travelers can be as low as 27% [2].  Three  stool  examinations,  together  with  parasite  serologies  for strongyloidiasis,  schistosomiasis  and  filariasis,  are  more  sensitive (89%) [2]. The predictive value of eosinophilia is higher in travelers with  particularly  high  eosinophil  counts  (absolute  count > 1000/ mm 3 ), and further work-up of these individuals is justified [3].

============================================================
CHUNK 11
============================================================
Schistosomiasis
Infection with Schistosoma spp.  should  be  suspected in  any traveler who  has  been  in  contact  with  potentially  infected  fresh  water  in endemic  areas.  Schistosomiasis  has  been  reported  following  both short-term [4, 5] and long-term travel [6, 7]. Heavy parasite loads in travelers are rare and so late-stage disease manifestations are also rare. The cost-effectiveness of diagnosing an occult asymptomatic parasitic infection  such  as  schistosomiasis  is  not  known.  Specialist  referral should be considered.
Testing  is  recommended  2-4  months  after  last  exposure  in  those who  are  asymptomatic  (Fig.  145.2).  Stool  and  urine  microscopy is  an  insensitive method of diagnosis. Rectal snip is more sensitive [8] but has been largely superseded by schistosomal antibody testing, which  is  both  sensitive  and  specific,  with  seroconversion  usually occurring  within  3  months  (occasionally  up  to  1  year).  A  positive test does not necessarily indicate active disease, as titers can remain
detectable for many years after successful eradication. Schistosomal antigen tests may provide more reliable measures of active infection in the future.

============================================================
CHUNK 12
============================================================
Sexual Health and HIV Screening
Sexual health screening in returned asymptomatic long-term travelers is an important part of the post-travel consultation, limiting secondary transmission and reassuring the traveler.
HIV  serologic  testing  is  reliably  specific  and  sensitive  and  can  be routinely offered to any traveler with a history of sexual contact with a  new partner [9]. Individuals should be offered an HIV test (with saliva  testing  or  rapid  serum  HIV  testing)  after  counseling  and informed consent has been gained, at the initial consultation, and again at 12 weeks post-exposure. A repeat test at 6 months may be recommended.
If potentially exposed to HIV within 72 hours of the consultation and depending on the type of exposure (skin penetration, type of bodily fluid  exchange,  likelihood  of  donor  positivity),  HIV  post-exposure prophylaxis  (PEP)  should  be  considered.  Donor  testing  should  be arranged if possible. Safe sexual practices should be encouraged in the period before testing.
Hepatitis  B,  C  and  syphilis  ( Treponema  pallidum) serology, Neisseria gonorrhoea and Chlamydia  trachomatis (direct  urethral/cervical  sampling, or indirect urine sampling), should also be considered and an examination  performed  for  warts,  ulcers,  and  discharge.  Specialist advice should be sought when necessary.
Screening for HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis C core antibodies,  should  be  performed  in  those  whose  exposure  history reveals  risk  factors  e.g.  needlestick  injury,  needle  shared  by  intravenous drug users, receipt of blood/blood product, exposure to contaminated needle/syringe during medical/dental treatment, or procedures in which contaminated instruments may have been used, such as during tattooing or body piercing.

CHUNK 13
============================================================
Trypanosomiasis
Serologic tests are sensitive for Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas disease) and Trypanosoma brucei gambiense , the two forms of trypanosomiasis that may be latent. Screening should be restricted to those travelers whose history  suggests  significant  exposure,  e.g.  poor  housing  in  an  area endemic in South America for triatomid bugs and T. cruzi , or exposure to  tsetse  fly  in  areas  of  Central  and  West  Africa  known  for  intense transmission  of T.  brucei  gambiense .  Guidelines  have  recently  been published for management of latent Chagas disease [10].

============================================================
CHUNK 14
============================================================
Tuberculosis
Incidence rates of TB infection in some long-term travelers are comparable to those of  the indigenous populations [1 1,  12]. Latent TB (positive  purified  protein  derivative  [PPD]  or  interferon-gamma release assay [IGRA]) was diagnosed significantly more commonly in long-term than in short-term travelers [7]. Healthcare workers, those who visit friends and relatives, and children under the age of 5 years, can be at particular risk, some of them to MDR and XDR TB [1 1, 13].
The American Thoracic Society recommends screening for tuberculosis in people likely to be recently infected, particularly those who have been in close contact with a known infectious case [14]. Screening should be targeted to those at high risk such as healthcare workers with prolonged travel in a country with an annual incidence of ≥ 40 TB  cases/100,000  population.  Tuberculin  testing  (Mantoux,  PPD) before and after exposure is recommended in this group. A change from a negative to a positive tuberculin skin test is more sensitive and specific than a chest x-ray and occurs 6 weeks to 4 months after TB exposure. Administration and interpretation of the test require expertise and timing. False-negative reactions are common when not performed  correctly [15]. A more  recent cost-effectiveness  model proposed a single post-travel tuberculin skin test in people originally from countries with a low incidence of TB [16].
Testing is less reliable in those who are immunocompromised and in those previously vaccinated with BCG. IGRA testing can be considered as an alternative test in cases with prior BCG vaccination. A chest x-ray should be taken for those with a positive test. Post-exposure prophylactic treatment averts progression to active disease in most cases.

============================================================
CHUNK 15
============================================================
Rabies PEP
Long-term asymptomatic travelers should be asked of their potential for  exposure to rabies as well as their pre-exposure vaccine history. Rabies  vaccine  and  IgG  should  be  considered,  depending  on  the exposure type and time.

============================================================
CHUNK 16
============================================================
Malaria
Malaria may become symptomatic after the initial post-travel period, and so all returned travelers from malaria-endemic areas should be educated  about  nonspecific  symptoms  and  signs,  especially  fever, during the first few months after return. They should be advised to seek  an  early  medical  opinion  and  inform  health  professionals  of their travel history, should these symptoms occur.

============================================================
CHUNK 17
============================================================
PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH
Psychological diagnoses were reported significantly more frequently in long-term travelers as compared to short-term travelers [7]. Many long-term travelers fail to make a successful transition to their country of posting or to their home country on return. The returnee may be hesitant to voice their concerns because of issues of confidentiality or fear of stigma/embarrassment. Debriefing sessions, time for rest and relaxation,  as  well  as  readjustment  and  re-adaptation  should  be encouraged.

============================================================
CHUNK 18
============================================================
CONCLUSIONS
All asymptomatic long-term travelers should have a post-travel consultation  on  their  return.  This  should  include  a  detailed  personal, travel  and  exposure  history  and  physical  examination.  Little  additional testing need be done, except when indicated by risk. The posttravel  consultation  is  also  an  opportunity  to re-emphasize  primary prevention messages and perform a general health review.
