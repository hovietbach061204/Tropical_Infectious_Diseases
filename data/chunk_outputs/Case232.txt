Fever in the Returned Traveler
Victoria Johnston, Michael Brown example,  gastroenteritis  or  respiratory  tract  infections,  particularly upper respiratory tract infections - are common. Amongst patients with undifferentiated fever, malaria, dengue and enteric fever are the most common diagnoses (see Fig. 143.1) [3].

============================================================
CHUNK 1
============================================================
Key features
- Travel, especially to developing countries, is associated with an increased risk of infections not usually seen in highincome countries, e.g. malaria, enteric fever, dengue, and schistosomiasis
- While gastroenteritis, respiratory tract infections, and self-limiting viral infections are common, an important minority of patients will have a potentially life-threatening tropical infection
- The evaluation of an ill returned traveler therefore requires a detailed travel history together with an understanding of the geographic distribution of infections, risk factors for acquisition, incubation periods, clinical presentations and appropriate laboratory investigations
- A syndromic approach to speci c investigations, and to presumptive therapy pending laboratory con rmation of the diagnosis, is appropriate
- As a rule, malaria should be excluded in all travelers presenting with a fever who have visited the tropics

============================================================
INTRODUCTION
Up to 70% of travelers to developing countries report health problems,  the  majority  of  which  are  self-limiting;  however  8-15%  of travelers are ill enough to seek medical attention while abroad or on return home, with fever as a common presenting complaint [1-4]. While  for  many  the  underlying  cause  is  a  self-limiting  globally endemic infection, such as gastroenteritis, physicians are increasingly encountering conditions not normally seen in the patient's country of origin. In some cases these are potentially life-threatening, such as malaria, and others have potential public health consequences, such as enteric fever.
To evaluate returned travelers presenting with fever, an understanding of the geographic distribution of infections, risk factors for acquisition, incubation periods and clinical presentations is required. With this understanding, a risk assessment can be undertaken, initial investigations  instigated,  and,  when  appropriate,  presumptive  therapy started.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Fever  in  returned  travelers  is  a  syndrome  with  an  epidemiology that  reflects  factors  relating  to  the  individual  traveler  and  to  the wide spectrum of etiologic pathogens. Organ-specific infections - for
The following factors influence an individual's risk of acquiring infection (see Table 143-1) [5]:

============================================================
CHUNK 4
============================================================
Individual Factors
- Purpose and duration of travel: individuals visiting friends and relations (VFR) and long-stay travelers (e.g. aid-workers) are at greatest risk of acquiring malaria, enteric fever, hepatitis A, tuberculosis, and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. This is in part due to longer duration of travel and closer proximity to the local population.
- Immune status: migrants  returning  to  their home countries may be immune to certain infections, such as hepatitis A and acute schistosomiasis;  however,  they  may  incorrectly  consider  themselves  immune  to  others,  such  as  malaria.  Consequently,  VFR travelers  are  less  likely  to  seek  pre-travel  advice,  take  malaria prophylaxis  or  receive  vaccines  [6].  Travelers  with  HIV,  malignancy or on immunosuppressant drugs are at increased risk of opportunistic infections, including nontyphoidal Salmonella and penicilliosis.
- Risk activities: certain risk activities expose individuals to infection, e.g. freshwater exposure and schistosomiasis, unprotected sexual intercourse and HIV.

============================================================
CHUNK 5
============================================================
Pathogen Factors
- Geographic  distribution: the  risk  of  acquiring  a  specific  infection varies with country and environment, e.g. urban or rural, mountains or coastal plains. While malaria is the most common infection  diagnosed  in  travelers  returned  from  sub-Saharan  Africa, dengue is more prevalent among travelers returning from Southeast  Asia  and  enteric  fever  from  south  central  Asia  (see  Table 143-1 and Fig. 143.1).
- Incubation  period: most  travelers  become  symptomatic  within 21  days  of  exposure,  with  the  majority  presenting  within  1 month  of  return.  However,  some  pathogens  have  a  much longer incubation period (e.g. Plasmodium vivax and tuberculosis); patients may present months or rarely years later (see Table 143-2).

============================================================

============================================================
CLINICAL FEATURES
Patients can present with undifferentiated fever or with organ-specific symptoms, such as gastroenteritis or respiratory infection. The most common  causes  are  discussed  below,  with  the  focus  on  returned travelers. For more detailed descriptions, relevant chapters on specific infections should be consulted.

============================================================
CHUNK 7
============================================================
Malaria [7]
Malaria is an important, potentially fatal infection in travelers returning from the tropics, particularly from sub-Saharan Africa. It should be  excluded  in  all  returned  travelers  with  a  history  of  fever.  Most short-term  travelers  present  within  1  month  of  return,  however P. falciparum occasionally presents up to 6 months later and P. vivax , P. ovale and P. malariae can present a year or more following return [8]. Many travelers do not take chemoprophylaxis, or take it inadequately [6]. When malaria is acquired despite chemoprophylaxis, the onset of symptoms is often delayed, severity of illness reduced, and microbiologic diagnosis may be obscured [9]. Because chemoprophylaxis  may  obscure the diagnosis, in cases where malaria is  thought likely, chemoprophylaxis should be stopped while patients are investigated [7].
Nearly all patients with malaria give a history of fever; however, up to  half  are  afebrile  on  presentation  and  specific  fever  patterns  are uncommon [10]. Headache, myalgia, arthralgia, and malaise are frequently described, with some patients reporting diarrhea or cough. Complications occur mainly with P. falciparum infection. In patients with confusion, seizures or reduced conscious level, cerebral malaria or hypoglycemia should be considered; hypoxia, tachypnea, and signs of pulmonary edema indicate respiratory involvement.

============================================================
CHUNK 8
============================================================
Enteric Fever ( Salmonella typhi , S. paratyphi )
Enteric fever is a potentially life-threatening infection which requires early diagnosis and management. It is a cause of fever, particularly in VFR travelers returning from Asia [3]. With an incubation period of 7-18 days (range up to 60 days) most patients will present within a month of return; however, later presentations are possible. A history of vaccination pre-travel has little predictive value; it provides incomplete protection against S. typhi and no protection against S. paratyphi .
In  addition  to  fever,  symptoms  include  headache,  constipation/ diarrhea, and dry cough. Complications, in particular encephalopathy and gastrointestinal bleeding and intestinal perforation, occur infrequently; they are more likely if the duration of illness is > 2 weeks.

============================================================
CHUNK 9
============================================================
Rickettsiae
The most common traveler-associated rickettsial infections are due to R.  africae (African  tick  typhus).  Endemic  throughout  sub-Saharan Africa, it is a common diagnosis in travelers who have visited game parks in southern African. R. conorii (Mediterranean spotted fever or tick bite fever), endemic throughout sub-Saharan Africa, the Mediterranean, Caspian littoral, Indian subcontinent and Middle East, is also well described. Travelers infected with R. typhi (murine typhus) and Orientia tsutsugamushi (scrub typhus) are rarely encountered.
Rickettsiae have a short incubation period (5-7 days; up to 10 days) and similar presentations. More than 80% of patients infected with R. africae or R. conorii describe fever, headache and myalgia. The classic signs of inoculation eschar, rash and lymphadenitis are seen in < 50%; however, retrospective cohorts report  higher  rates (Fig. 143.2) [1 1]. Complications, for example. reactive arthritis, are rarely encountered in African tick typhus; mortality rates of up to 32% have been reported for Mediterranean tick bite fever, 17% for scrub typhus and 4% for murine typhus [12-14].

CHUNK 10
============================================================
Arbovirus
There are over 500 arthropod-borne viruses worldwide; not all cause disease in humans. The majority are restricted to specific geographic locations; for example, Ross River virus in Australia. They have short incubation periods ( < 1 week) and result in self-limiting illnesses. Four clinical presentations predominate:
- systemic febrile illness, e.g. all arboviruses
- hemorrhagic  fever,  e.g.  dengue,  yellow  fever,  Rift  Valley  fever, Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever
- acute  encephalitis,  e.g.  Japanese  encephalitis,  Rift  Valley  fever, West Nile virus, Eastern and Western equine encephalitis viruses
- polyarthralgia or arthritis, e.g. chikungunya, Ross River.

CHUNK 14
============================================================
Arbovirus
Dengue is the most prevalent arbovirus in travelers. Although widespread, it is a common cause of fever only in those returning from Asia, the Caribbean and South America [15]. Most travelers present with  a  febrile  illness  associated  with  headache,  retro-orbital  pain, myalgia, arthralgia (especially back pain) and rash [15]. The rash is initially erythrodermic, and becomes petechial with disease progression (Fig. 143.3). Hepatitis, myocarditis, encephalitis and neuropathy can  occur.  Bleeding  gums,  epistaxis  and  gastrointestinal  bleeding occur but are not necessarily indicative of dengue hemorrhagic fever, which like dengue shock syndrome is rare in travelers. Chikungunya is increasingly reported in returning travelers from the islands of the Indian Ocean, South and Southeast Asia [16]. The clinical presentation  is  similar  to  classic  dengue  fever;  however,  arthralgia  is  more prominent.  In  the  majority  of  cases,  the  arthralgia  settles;  5-30% develop chronic arthropathy with pain, stiffness and swelling lasting months to years [17,18].

============================================================
CHUNK 15
============================================================
Acute Schistosomiasis (Katayama Fever)
This should be considered in febrile travelers returning from Africa. Travelers give a history of freshwater exposure 4-6 (up to 9) weeks prior  to  symptom  onset.  Some  describe  a  self-resolving  itchy  rash immediately  following  exposure  (swimmer's  itch).  Symptoms  and signs include fever, lethargy, myalgia, arthralgia, cough, wheeze, headache,  urticarial  rash,  diarrhea  and  hepatosplenomegaly  [19].  The

eosinophil count is usually elevated at presentation of acute schistosomiasis and provides supportive evidence for the diagnosis, but it may only appear a few days after symptom onset. Acute symptoms are self-limiting in most cases.

============================================================
CHUNK 16
============================================================
Leptospirosis
Leptospirosis  has  a  global  distribution.  Infection  occurs  through exposure  to  rodent  or  dog  urine-contaminated  fresh  water;  for example, through recreational water-sports, flooding, or occupational exposure. Following an incubation period of 7-12 days, patients classically present with a biphasic illness comprising a bacteremic phase with flu-like symptoms lasting 4-7 days, followed 1-3 days later by an immune phase characterized by fever, myalgia, hepatorenal syndrome and hemorrhage [20]. This severe end of the spectrum, Weil's disease,  occurs  infrequently  but  has  a  high  case-fatality  rate  of  1015%. Gastrointestinal and respiratory presentations and meningitis, myocarditis and pancreatitis are occasionally described.

============================================================
CHUNK 17
============================================================
Amebic Liver Abscess [21]
This should be considered in all patients with fever and a raised right hemi-diaphragm on chest radiography. It has a global distribution, with a higher prevalence in developing countries. Travelers, exposed through faecal-oral transmission, will often present weeks to months following  return  (incubation  period:  8-20  weeks).  Most  patients report fever and (often localized) abdominal pain; hepatomegaly is common. Only 20% give a history of dysentery and only 10% have diarrhea at presentation.

============================================================
CHUNK 18
============================================================
Brucellosis [22]
Brucellosis  is  acquired  through  ingestion  of  unpasteurized  milk, although  transmission  may  also  occur  through  direct  contact  with animal  parts  or,  in  laboratories,  through  inhalation  of  aerosolized particles. It has a global distribution, with a higher prevalence found in the Middle East,  Balkan Peninsula, former USSR, Mediterranean and South America. Symptoms develop 2-4 weeks following exposure (up to 6 months described) and vary from an acute febrile illness to a chronic low-grade relapsing fever; signs include lymphadenopathy,  hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. Complications of brucellosis are  common  -  in  particular,  large-joint  septic  arthritis,  sacroiliitis, and, less commonly, spondylitis of the lumbar spine. Other complications include epididymo-orchitis, septic abortion, neurologic involvement (meningitis, encephalitis and abscess) and endocarditis.

CHUNK 19
============================================================
Q Fever ( Coxiella burnetii ) [23]
Although rarer than brucellosis, Q fever has a similar epidemiologic and  clinical  history.  It  has  a  global  distribution,  with  most  cases related to occupational exposure, predominantly through inhalation of  aerosolized  particles.  Community  outbreaks,  as  reported  in  the Netherlands in 2008, occur [24] The majority of cases are asymptomatic; however, the diagnosis should be considered in patients presenting  with  fever,  pneumonia  or  hepatitis  following  exposure  to farms  or  animals.  Complications,  including  chronic  infection,  are well described, particularly endocarditis.

============================================================
CHUNK 20
============================================================
HIV and Other STIs
Between 5% and 51% of short-term travelers take part in casual sex while abroad, with higher rates reported in long-term travelers [25]. The prevalence of HIV in many tropical countries is high and often not restricted to certain risk groups. Many STIs can present as a febrile illness, including HIV seroconversion, secondary syphilis (Fig. 143.4) and gonorrhea. People living with HIV who travel to the tropics are also  at  increased  risk  of  opportunistic  infections  (see  Table  143-1) [26].

============================================================
CHUNK 21
============================================================
RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS
Respiratory tract infections are diagnosed as the underlying cause of febrile  illness  in  7-24%  of  returning  travelers  [5].  These  include sinusitis,  pharyngitis,  tonsillitis,  bronchitis,  influenza,  pneumonia and pulmonary eosinophilia. Influenza  is the  commonest vaccinepreventable infection acquired by travelers.

Lower Respiratory Tract Infections
- Histoplasmosis or coccidioidomycosis: exposure to damp conditions,  e.g.  bat-occupied  caves  or  dusty  conditions,  respectively. Coccidioidomycosis is restricted to certain areas in the Americas
- Legionella:  exposure  to  air-conditioning  or  other  aerosolized water sources in cruise ships or hotels
- Melioidosis  ( Burkholderia pseudomallei ): febrile  patients  from Southeast Asia with upper lung zone infiltrates or cavitation on chest radiography, or septicemia
- Q  fever:  fever,  pneumonia  or  hepatitis  following  exposure  to farms or animals
- Tuberculosis:  travel  to  areas  of  high  endemicity,  particularly amongst  VFRs,  long-stay  travelers,  healthcare  workers  and  the immune-compromised; active disease is uncommon [27]
- Fever,  respiratory  symptoms  and  peripheral  eosinophilia:  consider Loeffler's syndrome ( Ascaris , hookworm, Strongyloides ), acute schistosomiasis, tropical pulmonary eosinophilia (filaria), leaking hydatid cyst, visceral larva migrans, and paragonimiasis [28].

============================================================
CHUNK 24
============================================================
Diarrhea
Travelers' diarrhea has a reported incidence of at least 200 cases/1000 ill  returned travelers [3].  Fever is self-reported in one-third of these patients, making it an important underlying etiology in febrile travelers.  Specific  pathogens  vary  according  to  destination,  setting  and season; however, enteric bacteria including Escherichia coli , Campylobacter , Salmonella , and Shigella are the most common. In up to 50%, no  pathogen  is  identified.  The  combination  of  fever  and  bloody diarrhea is suggestive of bacterial or amebic dysentery, with the latter (uncommon in the returning traveler) often having a more indolent onset. In both cases, empiric  antibiotics should be considered (see below). It should be noted that any systemic febrile infection may have  diarrhea  at  presentation;  for  example,  severe  sepsis,  malaria, pneumococcal pneumonia.

Typical bacterial and viral causes should be considered. In addition, causes  of  predominantly  lymphocytic  meningitis  include:  arboviruses,  brucellosis,  leptospirosis,  Lyme  disease,  Q  fever,  relapsing fevers,  syphilis,  tuberculosis,  HIV  seroconversion,  and  HIV-related opportunistic infections, for example cryptococcal meningitis.

CHUNK 31
============================================================
PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS [5]
The evaluation of fever in returned travelers requires an understanding of the epidemiologic factors which influence exposure to specific pathogens. These factors are reflected in the travel history and include geographic  destinations  visited,  dates  of  particular  risk  exposures, time  of  onset  and  duration  of  symptoms.  The  first  two  determine which infections the traveler may have been exposed to and the last two  allow  for  an  estimation  of  the  incubation  period  (see  Tables 143.1 & 143.2).
As can be seen from Figure 143.1, the travel history is vital for determining the likely diagnosis, as many infections can have similar clinical presentations. Certain symptoms and signs may give further clues; relevant examination findings include rash, eschar, hepatosplenomegaly and jaundice (see Tables 143-3, 143-4 & 143-5). Table 143-6 lists  the  differential  diagnosis  in  patients  with  chronic  fever  ( > 2 weeks), and is a reminder that noninfectious causes of fever are seen in this group.
Travelers presenting with undifferentiated fever should have a number of initial recommended investigations performed (see Table 143-7). Following this, specific investigations may be appropriate, depending on the differential diagnosis (see Table 143-8). Where tuberculosis is considered, it is essential that adequate samples of sputum or tissue for  mycobacteria  culture  are  obtained.  Tuberculin  skin  tests  and interferon-gamma release assays have a limited role in evaluation of patients with chronic fever.
Rarely, fever in the returned traveler may be due to a viral hemorrhagic fever such as Lassa, Ebola, Marburg or Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever.  The  diagnosis  should  be  considered  in  travelers  who  have visited endemic regions within 21 days of symptom onset [29,30], in particular, travel to rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa (particularly West Africa); contact with suspected cases, healthcare facilities, rats or wild animals  raises  the  index  of  suspicion.  Symptoms  and  signs  vary according to pathogen, with bleeding in  advanced  cases.  Although rare, these infections can be severe and have implications for nosocomial transmission. Malaria must be excluded; however, PCR of blood may be required, before further investigations (which might result in exposure of healthcare staff) are performed. A high index of suspicion and  close  liaison  with  specialists  are  necessary  to  manage  such patients appropriately.

Malaria
Parasitic confirmation (smears, RDTs, or PCR) of suspected malaria is  preferred  and  empiric  treatment  is  not  recommended in  clinical settings  with  good  diagnostic  facilities.  However,  diagnostic  results must be accurate, timely, and available to the treating physician. Accuracy will depend upon the skills of the microscopist; RDT and PCR results  reflect  the  performance  characteristics  of  the  assay.  When accurate results will not be available for more than 6 hours, presumptive treatment is encouraged, as delay in treatment has been associated with poor clinical outcomes, especially in patients with severe malaria [7].

where  available,  serology  (which  may  be  falsely  negative  in  early disease). Most patients demonstrate clinical improvement, with resolution of fever within 48-72 hours. The main differential diagnosis is a pyogenic liver abscess; therefore, patients with evidence of sepsis require broad-spectrum antibiotics until the diagnosis is confirmed. Surgical or percutaneous drainage is rarely required and should only be considered if there is diagnostic uncertainty, symptoms persist after 4 days of treatment, or if there is imminent risk of rupture into critical sites  (e.g.  left-lobe  abscess  rupturing  into  pericardium)  [3 1].  After completion of treatment, all patients should be given 10 days of a luminal  amebicide  to  prevent  relapse:  diloxanide  furoate  (500 mg orally three times daily), or paromomycin (30 mg/kg orally in three divided doses).

============================================================
CHUNK 39
============================================================
Enteric Fever
When there is a strong suspicion a parenteral third-generation cephalosporin (e.g. ceftriaxone) can be commenced pending blood culture results.  Fluoroquinolone-resistant  isolates  are  reported  in  patients returning from Asia, but rarely reported in those returning from Africa [32].  Ciprofloxacin  750 mg  twice  daily  remains  the  treatment  of choice  for  fully  sensitive  isolates.  Azithromycin  1 g  followed  by 500 mg daily should be used as follow-on therapy where fluoroquinolone  resistance  is  suspected  or  confirmed.  Regardless  of  which antibiotic is used, fever takes some time to resolve; failure to defervesce is not a reason to change antibiotics where the isolate is confirmed as sensitive.

============================================================
CHUNK 40
============================================================
Leptospirosis
Due  to  the  potential  severity  of  the  illness,  the  nonspecific  nature of  initial  investigations,  and  a  minimum  period  of  6-10  days before  confirmatory  serology  becomes  available,  a  5-7-day  course of  penicillin  (benzylpenicillin  1.5  million  units  four  times  daily) or doxycycline (100 mg  twice daily)  should  be considered in patients  with  a  flu-like  illness  within  7-12  days  of  freshwater exposure.

============================================================
CHUNK 41
============================================================
Rickettsiae
Fever and headache, with or without rash, developing within 10 days of exposure to ticks in southern African game parks should prompt treatment with doxycycline 100 mg twice daily while other infections are excluded. A response is expected within 24-48 hours.

============================================================
Acute Schistosomiasis
Empiric treatment should be offered to travelers presenting with fever, urticarial rash, and eosinophilia ( > 0.45 × 10 9 /L) within 4-8 weeks of freshwater exposure [28]. Praziquantel, 40 mg/kg, in a divided dose 4 hours apart, will kill mature but not immature schistosomes ( Schistosoma  japonicum: 60 mg/kg  in  three  divided  doses).  Treatment should therefore be given at the time of diagnosis, but repeated 6-8 weeks later. Corticosteroids are generally advocated to help alleviate acute symptoms.

CHUNK 43
============================================================
Bacterial Sepsis
International travel, particularly to India, Middle East, and Africa, is associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  acquiring  extended-spectrum β -lactamase (ESBL)-producing Gram-negative pathogens [33]. Fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter isolates are increasingly reported in travelers returning from Asia. This should be taken into account when empiric antibiotics are indicated.
