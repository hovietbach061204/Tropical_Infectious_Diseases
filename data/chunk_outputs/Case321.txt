KEY FEATURES
- fungal infection caused by the dimorphic fungus Talaromyces (formerly Penicillium ) marneffei, affecting primarily immunocompromised individuals who reside in or travel to the highlands and surrounding regions of Southeast Asia, southern China, and northeastern India.
+ T-cell count of ≤ 100 cells/ μ L and individuals with impaired cellular immunity are at risk of infection.
- patients during the late stage of disseminated infection, enabling a presumptive diagnosis through microscopic identi{cation of the characteristic midline septa of the yeast on a touch skin smear. Other clinical features are non-speci{c and are indistinguishable from disseminated tuberculosis, which is both the most frequent misdiagnosis and the most frequent co-infection.
- temperature-dependent dimorphism, which can take up to 2 weeks to identify. Delay in time to diagnosis and treatment is associated with higher mortality.
- reaction (PCR) and monoclonal antibody based antigen assay, are promising and are being evaluated in larger clinical studies.
- deoxycholate reduces six month mortality, immune reconstitution in|ammatory syndrome, and relapse incidence compared with itraconazole and needs to be made more widely available in Asia.

INTRODUCTION
The dimorphic fungal pathogen Talaromyces marneffei causes lifethreating infection in predominantly immunocompromised residents and travelers to tropical regions in Southeast Asia, and in particular, Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, northeastern India, southern China, Hong Kong, and T aiwan (Fig. 90.1). 1 T. marneffei exhibits temperature-dependent dimorphism. At 37°C T. marneffei grows as a yeast form, uniquely dividing by binary {ssion. At 25°C the fungus grows as a mold, producing a characteristic bright red pigment that diffuses into the media. (Fig. 90.2C). The pathogen was classi{ed under the Penicillium subgenus Biverticillium until 2011, when this subgenus was found to form a monophyletic group with the genus Talaromyces that was distinct from Penicillium. It was then  reclassi{ed  to T.  marneffei, 2 and  infection  is  now  called talaromycosis .

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Rare before the HIV epidemic, talaromycosis is now among the most  common  causes  of  death  in  patients  with  advanced  HIV infection in endemic regions. 3,4 The incidence has decreased in

Thailand  and  Hong  Kong,  where  HIV  testing  rates  and  antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage are high. However, talaromycosis remains a public health problem in Vietnam and China, accounting for 5% to 15% of AIDS admissions annually, 3-5 and is a leading cause of HIV-associated bloodstream infection. 6,7 The number of talaromycosis  cases  diagnosed  outside  of  the  endemic  areas  is increasing as a consequence of increased migration and international travel. 8 T alaromycosis has been recently recognized as a common opportunistic infection in Asia in persons with adult-onset primary immunode{ciency associated with anti-interferon-gamma autoantibodies.  It  has  also  emerged  in  individuals  with  secondary immunode{ciency  conditions due to autoimmune diseases, malignancies, and solid organ and stem cell transplantations that require immunosuppressive therapy. 9

ECOLOGY
Multiple {eld studies have contributed to identifying ecological reservoirs and routes of human acquisition of T.  marneffei . 1,10,11 T. marneffei has been isolated in the lungs, liver, and spleen of all four bamboo rat species in mountainous regions in tropical Asia ( Rhizomys spp. and Cannomys badius ), 11 as well as from soil samples and  bamboo  rat  feces  near  their  burrows. 11 The  isolates  from bamboo rats and humans have similar or identical genotypes. 10 There is no evidence of direct bamboo rat-to-human transmission. Exposure to animals and plants and living in proximity or traveling to  the  highlands  and  surrounding  regions  are  risk  factors  of infection,  suggesting  soil  in  the  highland  regions  is  a  natural reservoir. 12,13 Other epidemiologic data supporting soil as a reservoir are a 30% to 50% increase in incidence during the rainy season 3,14 and an increase in incidence during humid months. 15,16 Thus the ecology  of T.  marneffei is  likely  to  involve  an  interaction  with multiple  reservoirs  involving  soil,  plant  materials,  and  animals, within which the bamboo rat may help T. marneffei to expand its biomass and its geography.

PATHOGENESIS
The mechanisms by which T. marneffei invades the host are not well  understood.  It  is  presumed  that  hosts  become  infected  by inhaling environmental conidia. Macrophages serve as the primary line of host defense; they phagocytize T. marneffei conidia via an L-arginine-dependent nitric oxide pathway. 17  CD4 + T-cell-mediated immunity is necessary for control of infection 18 and produces a Th1 cytokine response with high levels of interleukin-12, gamma interferon, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. 19 Healthy individuals can  control  the  pathogen  after  acquisition;  however,  quiescent infection may persist for years and reactivate later in life. Failure of both innate and cellular immune responses leads to pathogen invasion and dissemination through the reticuloendothelial system. T. marneffei Mp1p, a highly antigenic mannoprotein located on the  fungal  cell  wall,  enhances  survival  of T.  marneffei inside macrophages and is a critical virulence factor in a mouse model. 20 Mp1p binds and sequesters arachidonic acids, a key proin|ammatory lipid, to dampen host innate immune response. 21

patients, in particular, HIV-infected patients with a CD4 + T-cell count ≤ 100 cells/mm 3 . 1,3 Patients have fever, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and respiratory and gastrointestinal abnormalities. These features can be indistinguishable from disseminated tuberculosis and other opportunistic infections caused by intracellular pathogens. Characteristic skin lesions are present in 60% to 70% of patients and present as central-necrotic papules on the face, neck, chest, back, and upper extremities (Fig. 90.2A). Common laboratory {ndings are anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated  serum  aspartate  aminotransferase  and  alanine  aminotransferase. 3 Primary central nervous system infections have been reported. 22 Localized infections are more common in

CLINICAL FEATURES AND OUTCOMES
non-HIV-infected patients, including chronic pulmonary cavity lesions, abdominal abscesses, obstructive tracheal lesions, genital chancroid lesions, pericardial effusion, and osteoarthritis. 23 Disseminated infection is fatal if untreated and has an on-treatment mortality of up to 30% in both HIV-infected and non-HIV-infected patients. 23 Higher mortality is associated with delay in diagnosis, older age, shorter duration of symptoms, dyspnea, absence of fever or skin lesions, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels. 3,5,7

DIAGNOSIS
A presumptive diagnosis can be made by microscopic examination of  Giemsa-  or  Wright-stained  smears  of  skin  lesions,  lymph nodes,  or  bone  marrow  aspirates.  These  stains  show  oval  to round  intra-macrophage  and  extra-macrophage  yeasts  with characteristic central septa (Fig. 90.2B). The de{nitive diagnosis is based on culture isolation of pathogen, demonstrating temperature-dependent dimorphic growth. Culture can take up to 14  days  for  identi{cation,  leading  to  delay  in  diagnosis  and treatment. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays have been developed to improve diagnostic accuracy and speed. These assays are highly speci{c but suffer from  low  sensitivity (60%-70%), due to low circulating fungal DNA in the blood and  dif{culties  in  releasing  DNA  from  the  thick  fungal  cell wall. 24 Monoclonal antibody-based antigen detection assays have demonstrated higher sensitivities compared to blood culture and PCR. 25,26 Among them, the Mp1p-based antigen detection assay showed a sensitivity of 90% and a speci{city of 98% and is being developed for commercial use. 27

COMPLICATIONS AND CO-INFECTIONS
Profoundly immunosuppressed patients are at risk for developing immune  reconstitution  in|ammatory  syndrome  (IRIS)  upon initiation of ART. T alaromycosis IRIS is manifested as 'paradoxical' worsening of treated infection (paradoxical IRIS) or uncovering  of 'occult'  infection  (unmasking  IRIS).  Common  clinical manifestations of paradoxical IRIS are an exacerbation of skin lesions,  fever,  lymphadenopathy,  aseptic  arthritis  of  large  and small joints (Fig. 90.3C), or erythema nodosum (Fig. 90.3D). 28 Skin  lesions  in  paradoxical  IRIS  can  be  atypical,  including erythematous  nodules  (Fig.  90.3A),  verrucous  lesions,  and erythematous  plaques (Fig. 90.3B).  Continuation  of  ART, antifungal therapy, non-steroidal anti-in|ammatory medications, and  judicious  use  of  corticosteroids  for  joint  involvement  are recommended. 28 Relapse rates are low (1%-7%) in patients who are compliant on secondary prophylaxis with itraconazole and on effective ART. 29 Co-infection with microbiological-con{rmed tuberculosis occurs in 22% of patients and complicates management  due  to  itraconazole-rifampicin  interactions,  requiring therapeutic drug monitoring (when available) and an increased dose of itraconazole. 3 Co-infection with cryptococcal meningitis is rare but presents a therapeutic dilemma, as neither itraconazole nor |uconazole by itself is effective in the maintenance therapy for  co-infections. 22 These  patients  likely  require  new  triazole drugs  with  good  activities  against  both  pathogens  such  as voriconazole or isavuconazole for maintenance antifungal therapy.

ANTIFUNGAL TREATMENT AND PREVENTION
International guidelines recommend initial therapy with amphotericin  B  deoxycholate  for  2  weeks,  followed  by  itraconazole consolidation therapy for 10 weeks, and maintenance therapy until CD4 counts  are > 100  cells/mm 3 for  at  least  6  months. 30 This recommendation has been con{rmed by a multicenter itraconazole versus amphotericin B for talaromycosis trial (IVAP) demonstrating that amphotericin was superior to itraconazole as initial therapy with respect to 6-month mortality, and IRIS and relapse incidence. 29 The fungal clearance data from this trial suggested that a short course of ≤ 8 days of amphotericin might be effective but requires further studies. 29 Liposomal amphotericin B and voriconazole are also effective; however, these drugs may not be available in resourcelimited settings. Primary prophylaxis with itraconazole is shown to prevent invasive fungal infections in patients with CD4 counts < 200 cells/ mm 3 in Thailand 31 ; however, the strategy has not been widely  adopted  in  Asia  because  of  high  costs  and  concerns  of toxicity and drug resistance.
