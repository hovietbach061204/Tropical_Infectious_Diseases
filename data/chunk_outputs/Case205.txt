Key features
- Human dracunculiasis manifests as an ulcer on the skin, with the nematode Dracunculus medinensis protruding through the lesion
- It is an incapacitating disease of poor residents in rural areas without access to safe drinking water. It severely a-ects agricultural productivity and school attendance
- Infection occurs after ingestion of freshwater copepods that contain the larval worm. Acute manifestations begin about 1 year after infection with the formation of a skin blister, accompanied by redness and irritation (burning sensation), and usually preceded by fever and allergic symptoms, including intense generalized itching
- The intense skin irritation prompts the patient to seek relief by immersing the lesion in water. After the blister breaks, an ulcer-like lesion develops with the anterior end of the parasite exposed, allowing the adult female worm to discharge larvae into the water
- Lesions occur on the lower extremities, including the ankle or foot in about 90% of cases, but the parasite can exit from anywhere on the body
- Other manifestations are due to abscess formation if the worm is broken during the process of manual extraction or when they die before exiting the body and calcify. Chronic manifestations of arthritis, synovitis, and muscle and tendon contractures with resultant ankylosis of the limb are rare
- Synonyms: Guinea worm disease, dracontiasis, dracunculosis

INTRODUCTION
Dracunculiasis is caused by the nematode Dracunculus medinensis , and is a disabling disease of poor rural residents in parts of six countries in  Africa  [1,  2].  This  infection  manifests  by  2-3-foot  (~1 m)-long worms that emerge directly through a lesion on the skin; it has an enormous  adverse  impact  on  agricultural  production  and  school attendance. The infection is close to being eradicated. D. medinensis has been known since ancient Egyptian times. The life cycle of the parasite was first fully described by Alexei Fedechenko in 1870 [3].

EPIDEMIOLOGY
During  the  nineteenth  and  twentieth  centuries,  dracunculiasis  was common in much of southern Asia,  and  in  North,  West  and  East Africa.  When  the  Dracunculiasis  Eradication  Program  was  getting underway in 1986, an estimated 3.5 million cases occurred annually in  India,  Pakistan,  and  16  African  countries  [4].  Transmission  of dracunculiasis in Yemen was confirmed during 1994, and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the Central African Republic to  have  indigenous  transmission  in  1996,  making  it  the  twentieth endemic country [5]. By 2008, only 4619 cases were reported from six remaining endemic countries: Ethiopia and Sudan in East Africa, and Ghana, Mali, Niger, and Nigeria in West Africa (Fig. 1 14.1) [1,2]. Because of the global campaign, Asia became free of the disease in 1997.
People become infected when they drink water containing tiny freshwater copepods called 'Cyclops' or 'water fleas', which act as intermediate  hosts  and  harbor  infective  larvae  [6].  When  the  ingested
FIGURE 114.1 Extent of areas in Africa a4ected by dracunculiasis in 1986 and in 2008.
copepods are killed by the digestive juices in the stomach, the larvae are released and move to the small intestine, where they penetrate the intestinal wall and migrate to the connective tissues of the thorax [6]. Male and female larvae mature and mate 60-90 days after infection. Over the next 10-14 months, gravid female worms mature, reaching lengths of 70-100 cm (2-3 feet), and slowly migrate to the surface of the body (Fig. 1 14.2), where they become visible through ulceration. On contact with fresh water, powerful contractions cause a loop of the worm's uterus to break and discharge a swarm of motile larvae. Contraction of  the worm and discharge of larvae  may  be repeated if  the  lesion is  again submerged in water, until the entire brood of larvae is discharged. Motile free-swimming larvae are ingested whole by copepods and mature in the body cavity in about 2 weeks. Stagnant  sources  of  drinking  water  such  as  ponds,  cisterns,  pools  in dried-up river beds, and shallow unprotected hand-dug wells commonly harbor copepods, and are the usual sites where infection is transmitted.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Seasonality varies according to location. In the remaining countries with endemic transmission in the Sahel area of Africa (e.g. Mali, Niger, northern  Nigeria,  Southern  Sudan,  and  Ethiopia),  transmission usually peaks during the rainy season at mid-year (May-September). This is because stagnant surface sources of water are more common during  the  5-6-month-long  rainy  season.  In  currently  endemic
Copepods countries near the Gulf of Guinea (e.g. Ghana and southern Nigeria), the  disease  peaks  during  the  dry  season,  from  October  to  March, when mostly stagnant sources of drinking water remain, in contrast to  abundant  surface  water  sources  during  the  rest  of  the  year.  The seasonal  emergence  of  the  worm  often  coincides  with  harvest  or planting seasons, and thus significantly affects agricultural productivity and also school attendance. Sudan, the country with the highest incidence of dracunculiasis, in 2008 reported 47% of 3618 cases of dracunculiasis among young adults (ages 16-35); 47% of the cases were male (Makoy SYL, personal communication).

NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, PATHOLOGY, AND CLINICAL FEATURES
Infected people remain asymptomatic for approximately a year after infection,  until  the  mature  female  worm  approaches  the  skin  and forms  a  painful  papule  in  the  dermis.  This  papule  can  become  a blister within 24 hours or may enlarge for several days before blistering (Fig. 1 14.3). The blister is accompanied by redness and induration, and is usually preceded by systemic symptoms of low-grade fever and  allergic  symptoms  (erythema,  urticarial  rash,  intense  pruritus,

dizziness,  nausea, vomiting). The lesion produces intense irritation and  burning,  inducing  the  patient  to  seek  relief  by  immersing  the affected limb in water, where the blister breaks,  allowing  the adult worm to discharge larvae into the water (Fig. 1 14.4).
Eighty  to  ninety  percent  of  lesions  occur  on  the  lower  extremities, including the ankle or foot, but the worms can exit from anywhere on  the  body,  including  the  head,  upper  extremities,  buttocks  and genitalia.  More  than  one  worm  may  emerge  from  a  given  patient either  simultaneously  or  sequentially  over  a  period  of  weeks  or months. As the worm emerges through the skin lesion, the affected person pulls it out slowly and carefully (because of inflammation and pain), usually by winding a few centimeters of the worm each day on a small stick. This very painful process may last many weeks.

============================================================
NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, PATHOLOGY, AND CLINICAL FEATURES
Pain and other symptoms may lessen with the rupture of the blister, but, at this time, pyogenic organisms invariably invade the superficial lesion and worm tract and aggravate the condition (Fig. 1 14.4). If the worm breaks during extraction and the remaining part retracts into the tissue, an intense inflammatory reaction occurs, with pain, swelling, and cellulitis along the worm tract, and usually the formation of an abscess. The reported period of incapacitation ranges from 2 to 16 weeks (average 8.5 weeks) [7-14] and more than half of a village's population may be affected at the same time. In addition to the blisters and skin lesions, the secondary bacterial infections usually exacerbate local inflammation and often lead to sepsis, abscesses, septic arthritis, contracture of muscles near joints, or even tetanus [15].
Chronic manifestations are due to inflammation of the joints, with signs  and  symptoms  of  arthritis,  synovitis  [16],  and  muscle  and tendon contractures with resultant ankylosis of the limb [17]. Migration of the worms to the retroperitoneum and from the retroperitoneum  to  the  subcutaneous  tissue  in  the  leg  sometimes  results  in aberrant  (ectopic)  locations  such  as  the  pancreas,  lung,  periorbital tissues, testis, pericardium [18], and the spinal cord, producing compression [19] as well as focal abscess formation.

PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
There are no serodiagnostic tests available to detect a patient with an incubating Guinea worm. Diagnosis is based on the clinical history and findings with an appropriate exposure. The blister fluid is bacteriologically  sterile  and initially  contains polymorphonuclear leukocytes and later lymphocytes, eosinophils and macrophages. Larvae are always present in the fluid and white blood cells adhere to them [6]. With  time,  the  blister  and  worm  track  can  become  secondarily infected.
Because differentiation between human and zoonotic species of Dracunculus (which rarely affect humans) requires morphologic examination  of  adult  male  worms  (which  are  rarely  available),  efforts  are underway to map the genome of the Guinea worm's DNA in order to ascertain the infecting parasite's species more precisely. Although there are several known zoonotic species of Dracunculus , only medinensis is specific to humans. A molecular tool is now available to differentiate between D. medinensis and other tissue-dwelling nematodes, including other Dracunculus species that may on rare occasions infect humans [20]. Work on determining the genome of D. medinensis is ongoing at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Eberhard ML, personal communication).

TREATMENT
There is no curative drug or vaccine against dracunculiasis. Infected people do not develop immunity. Applying wet compresses to the lesion  may  relieve  pain  during  the  worm's  emergence.  Placing  an occlusive bandage on the wound keeps it clean and may help prevent the patient from contaminating sources of drinking water. Oral analgesics and anti-inflammatory medicines can be administered to alleviate pain and inflammation. Topical antiseptics or antibiotic ointment may  minimize  the  risk  of  secondary  bacterial  infections,  reduce inflammation, and may permit removal of the worm by gentle traction  over  a  number  of  days.  Systemic  antibiotics  may  be  used  in established infections. Patients usually recover completely, but repeated infections may occur.

PREVENTION
Prevention of dracunculiasis includes education of the at-risk population about the disease and avoidance measures, filtration of drinking water to remove copepods, and prevention of infected people from entering  water  intended  for  drinking.  Developing  safe  sources  for drinking water is also a key feature of control [2 1]. The global eradication program has achieved great success towards its goal, with only six remaining endemic countries [1, 2].

This  paper  provides  an  update  on  the  status  of  the  global  campaign  to  eradicate dracunculiasis as of mid-2009. Annual cases of dracunculiasis have decreased from 3.5 million to fewer than 10,000 since the World Health Assembly mandated eradication in 1986. The number of indigenous dracunculiasis cases continued to decline and fell below 5000 for the first time in 2008. In 2009, the continued success of the eradication campaign is threatened most by program disruptions from sporadic insecurity, violence and unrest, particularly in Southern Sudan.
